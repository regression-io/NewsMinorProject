        "article_text": "Max Verstappen won the Japanese Grand Prix for the fourth successive time as he fended off McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.\nFormula 1 now heads to Bahrain for the second race of a triple-header, from 11-13 April.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions.\nWhy do drivers rate Suzuka as their favourite circuit when pole usually wins and there is very little chance of overtaking? Sunday's race was quite boring once Max Verstappen got to the first corner before Lando Norris. - Stuart\nThe two things - the concept of a favourite circuit and one where overtaking is very difficult and the racing therefore sometimes uneventful - are not mutually exclusive.\nJust look at Monaco. The drivers love the challenge of the track, but accept the race is likely going to be processional. So too with Suzuka.\nSome drivers did remark on the lack of action. But Fernando Alonso had a more nuanced take.\nAlonso has won at both Monaco and Suzuka, and made one of his greatest - one of the greatest - overtaking moves there when he passed Michael Schumacher's Ferrari around the outside of 130R in 2005.\nAlonso said: \"This is Suzuka. I don't remember a race many times in the past where there is lots of overtaking without the weather changing.\n\"It seems every year we repeat always on Thursday how great Suzuka is, how great Monaco is, the glamour, the spectacular weekend, and then on Sunday we wake up and say: 'Ah, Monaco is boring, what can we do to the track? Suzuka is boring.'\n\"Instead of looking at the negative, I try to enjoy the experience, and it was another great Suzuka.\"\nOne thing is worth mentioning here. The resurfacing of the track in the first sector changed Suzuka this year from a circuit where tyre degradation was high, to one where it was low.\nThat changed the race from a two-stop strategy to a one. Add in the difficulty of overtaking to an event where there were no significant tyre-pace offsets developing, and the race was always likely to be processional.\nThis, though, led to a race that was driven pretty much flat out all the way by the drivers. And that - rare in the Pirelli era - they enjoy.\nSo just because it fell short as entertainment, as a challenge for the drivers, it was very real.\nMax Verstappen - sensational all weekend on his way to victory - said: \"It was a fun race. The whole race I saw two orange cars in my mirror and, especially those last 20 laps, we were pushing quite hard out there. You had to keep on fighting it, basically being on the limit.\"\nOn the limit for an hour and a half around the greatest circuit on the planet. No racing driver is ever going to find that boring.\nBahrain Grand Prix\n11-13 April - race starts at 16:00 BST on 13 April\nSakhir\nGiven the demotion to Racing Bulls for Liam Lawson, what are Jack Doohan's chances looking like at Alpine given that Franco Colapinto is a reserve driver? - Anjum\nWell, the first thing to say is just because Red Bull demoted Lawson, that does not necessarily mean Alpine will do the same to Doohan.\nOn the surface, the Australian has had a traumatic start to the season. In three races so far, he has had two massive, expensive crashes. One when he spun in the wet in Australia, and one in Friday practice in Japan. Both were his errors.\nDoohan was not the only driver to crash in the difficult wet conditions in Melbourne. Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz also did. And many more drivers spun or made mistakes.\nAnd there were some significant mitigating circumstances in Suzuka.\nDoohan's crash was caused by him entering Turn One with the DRS overtaking aid still open. So the car didn't have enough downforce to cope with the G-forces on it.\nHe had been doing the same in the simulator in preparation for the race, thinking the DRS was closing automatically. But with the small lift he had on this particular lap, it did not.\nAt the same time, given his inexperience, it perhaps would have been a good idea for the engineers to remind him of it.\nAlpine, though, had not realised he had been doing this in the simulator.\nAnother mitigating factor was Doohan was under pressure to make up time because he had missed first practice while reserve driver Ryo Hirakawa was given an outing in his car.\nWhy did Alpine not put Hirakawa in team-mate Pierre Gasly's car for first practice given Doohan's lack of experience at Suzuka? They had a difficult weekend in China and wanted to evaluate some new set-up ideas, for which they felt they needed Gasly's experience.\nDespite the two big accidents, Alpine feel Doohan has, on balance, had a positive start to the season, with some promising pace hidden by some unfortunate circumstances.\nBut he is certainly not safe yet.\nShould they decide to replace him, Alpine have two reserve drivers who could potentially step up - Colapinto and Estonian Paul Aron.\nSince signing Colapinto from Williams, following his cameo role in the final few races of last season, the theory has been the access to Latin American money the Argentine gives means Doohan is on borrowed time.\nBut that threat seems to have diminished for now, the funding perhaps more theoretical than real.\nUltimately, though, Doohan's fate rests on the whim of Alpine executive adviser Flavio Briatore. He'll decide what he decides, when he decides it.\nWas Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull debut a success, and is he an improvement on Liam Lawson? - Ed\nTsunoda set himself the target of scoring points on debut at Red Bull, and finished the race 12th, behind the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso. So, by the standards he set himself, it was not a success.\nRed Bull want Tsunoda to be scoring good points to boost their bid for the constructors' title. So by their standards, it was not a success either.\nHaving said that, it certainly showed promise.\nHe started off strongly, being close on pace to Max Verstappen in first practice, and was again looking decent in final practice.\nIn first qualifying, again he was only 0.1secs from Verstappen.\nFor second qualifying, Red Bull chose to give him one set of used tyres and one of new - not unusual for a quick driver in a quick car, but perhaps a mistake given his lack of experience with the team.\nThat meant he had only one realistic shot at getting into the top 10 shootout. And Tsunoda made an error on his only flying lap on new tyres, going into Turn One 15km/h faster than ever before, and having a moment.\nHis race was dictated by qualifying 14th, but he did overtake Lawson on lap one then pull off an undercut pass on Pierre Gasly's Alpine.\nAs for comparisons with Lawson before him, Tsunoda was a definite step up. He was faster than Lawson ever was, and looked a lot more in control and confident.\nBut he will have to do better than this in the future to have any chance of keeping a seat at Red Bull in 2026.\nHow likely is it that George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli will race for Mercedes in 2026, with both out of contract this year? \u2013 John\nThe answer to this question depends entirely upon Max Verstappen.\nIf the world champion decides to stay at Red Bull, Mercedes will keep Russell and Antonelli next year.\nIf he decides to move, Mercedes is his most likely option, in which case Toto Wolff would have to decide which driver to keep.\nOn performance right now, that would be Russell. But Antonelli is only 18, just three races into his career, and believed to have rich promise. Jettisoning him after a year would be harsh indeed.\nIn that scenario, Russell is likely to be an attractive candidate to Red Bull, too.\nWhat will Verstappen do? For now, he is relaxed and waiting to see how the season develops. He is under contract to Red Bull until the end of 2028, but has performance-related get-out clauses if he wants to leave.\nThe difficulty in making any decision about the future is no-one is absolutely certain what next year and beyond will look like in terms of engines.\nMercedes are widely believed to be ahead on development of the new 2026 power-units. But their future is uncertain.\nFIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem is pushing for an early abandonment of the 2026 engine formula and a return to naturally aspirated V10s running on sustainable fuel. Why, he has yet to explain. But for now all that matters is he is.\nThat exact route looks unlikely to happen. Ferrari and Red Bull back the V10 idea, but it is not appealing to Mercedes, Honda or Audi - and that's more than enough manufacturers to vote that idea down under F1's rule structures.\nBut that does not mean a change won't come before 2031 - the current end of the new engine regs.\nPerhaps manufacturers would agree to a different, bigger engine - a V8, for example - with a turbo and some hybrid element, but not as much as the 50% of total power planned for next year.\nThere is a meeting to discuss F1's future engine direction in Bahrain on Friday and no-one knows what the conclusion will be - or indeed if there will be one.\nVerstappen will wait a little longer to see how things stand on many fronts before making any decision on his future.\nBetween a packed calendar, other commitments and strict regulations on costs, how much time do F1 drivers actually get to practise driving their cars during a season? Is it mostly simulator based? \u2013 Arv\nIn-season testing in current cars is forbidden by F1's regulations.\nDrivers are allowed to test in cars that are more than a year old. This was unrestricted for a while, but has for 2025 been limited for current drivers to 1,000km a year.\nDrivers can also participate in Pirelli tyre development tests in the latest cars, or whatever spec of car is required, if called upon.\nOther than that, the only \"practice\" they get is in the simulator.\nWhether the best drivers in the world need any practice in a year in which there are 24 grands prix is another question.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nHow Verstappen stole Suzuka with McLaren stuck in 'rabbit hole'\nJapanese Grand Prix Review\nHow to follow Bahrain Grand Prix on the BBC",

Homes remain shattered. So do lives.\nWhen Rory McIlroy and the world's best golfers arrived in Augusta this week, along with an estimated 200,000 fans, the devastation caused by one of the United States' deadliest natural disasters was laid bare before them.\nIn September, Hurricane Helene hit the south-eastern States - leaving death and destruction in its wake.\nAugusta, nicknamed 'The Garden City' because of its natural greenery, felt its mighty force. The residents are still dealing with the effects.\n\"There were multiple hours of 80mph winds which laid all of the forest down,\" lifelong Augusta resident Tonya Bonitatibus told BBC Sport.\n\"A lot of trees fell on top of houses and crushed cars \u2013 I lost my truck. But I was a lucky one.\"\nWhen Helene reached the American coast, it brought extreme winds, numerous tornadoes and flooding across several states. \nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Helene is responsible for at least 249 fatalities in the United States, including at least 175 direct deaths.\nIt was the deadliest hurricane in the US since Katrina in 2005.\nFlorida, on the south-eastern frontier, bore the brunt of the force. But Helene quickly headed further north, engulfing South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia.\nAugusta, which is the third most populous city in Georgia, was attacked by gusts of wind which reached 100mph through the night of 26 September - with stark consequences.\n\"Helene's winds were responsible for killing 11 people - all from trees falling onto homes in the greater Augusta area,\" a spokesperson for the National Hurricane Center told BBC Sport.\n\"At least 362 homes and buildings were destroyed, while 3,000 others suffered major damage, and 3,500 others experienced minor to moderate damage.\"\nAugusta officials say almost 17,000 fallen trees have been removed from the city\nResidents living close to Augusta National had to leave their homes. Thousands were left without electricity and water.\nJoseph Crosby, his wife Kasey and their three children still cannot live in their storm damaged home, about five miles from the iconic course.\nHe recalls watching a mature Ash tree, which he estimates had grown over 60 feet tall, being \"blown around like a rag doll\".\n\"I think your brain compartmentalises what you're going through,\" Joseph recalls of the night itself.\n\"All you think of at that moment is just survival and keeping your kids safe. \n\"I just remember thinking if the tree came down on our house or something were to happen, would my kids be OK?\"\nThe Crosby family home is among 1,695 properties damaged in the city of Augusta. City officials estimate the cost of residential losses has reached $282m (\u00a3220m).\n\"Folks here are resilient but this won't soon be forgotten. It reminds one how frail and furious nature can be,\" local journalist Joe Kovac told BBC Sport.\n\nAugusta National Golf Club was not as badly affected as the suburbs nearby.\nBut it did not escape. \n\"After the storm when you rode around Augusta National, on Washington Road, the pile of trees was above your car for mile after mile,\" said Bonitatibus.\nTrees came down in their hundreds on the famed course, damaging one of golf's most famous greens on the par-three 16th.\nWalking the course now is a lighter, less claustrophobic experience.  \nYou can see through wooded areas that previously screened individual holes and made them their own isolated stations.\nThe separation of the ninth and first fairways is less cluttered. \nComing down the 11th hole it is possible to see into the neighbouring Augusta Country Club course.\nThe wooded area to the right of the newly-laid 16th green will have fewer shadows when the world's best golfers begin their challenge for the famous Green Jacket on Thursday.  \nSpeaking in January, Augusta National Golf Club chairman Fred Ridley said: \"As far as the golf course goes, it's in spectacular condition.\n\"We had minor damage to the course, the playing surfaces themselves, but we were able to get that back in shape.\n\"I don't think you're going to see any difference in the condition for the Masters this year.\"\nKovac, who recently wrote a vivid account of the city's recovery process,, external agreed.\n\"I was struck by how emerald-green it is, at least the periphery. It is as if the grass never flinched,\" said the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter.\n\"The kerbside lawn around the course perimeter looks manicured to the hilt. Only regular patrons will really notice trees are missing.\n\"But further into the miles of neighbourhoods ringing the National one cannot help but see the wreckage and its remains.\"\nDriving around Augusta, it does not take much to notice the roadsides still populated by fallen trees - oaks, ash and giant pines. \nLong established homes bear scars of severe roof damage, much of it protected only by the flimsy tarpaulins.\nLife has been dominated recently by the need to join lengthy queues for construction and repair workers. \n\"It's been a journey, just rebuilding. It's been really neat to see the community come together in a town like this,\" said Kasey Crosby.\n\"We've heard lots of stories of neighbours helping each other.\n\"Cutting neighbours out of their driveways so they can get their cars out and get to work, or to get to the grocery store. \n\"People are pulling together, helping one another with chainsaws and just showing up.\"\nAugusta is described by its government as a 'centre of medicine, manufacturing, and military'. \nHowever, its job market has long been unstable and the city is ranked among the neediest in the US.\nIn December 2023, local newspaper, the Augusta Chronicle, reported it was ranked the nation's fifth worst city for economic well-being.\nChild poverty, food insecurity and unemployment rates were highlighted as particular problems.\nBlue tarpaulin covering the roofs of Augusta houses is a common sight \nAugusta National, which stumped up $20m (\u00a315.8m) in Masters prize money last year, is well aware of its privilege.\nIn the aftermath of Helene, the club provided $5m of financial support to the relief fund.\nBonitatibus, a riverkeeper who looks after the Savannah waterway, says the aid had a \"huge\" impact and reinforced Augusta National's philanthropic role in the community.\nThe money helped provide food, water, laundry, showers and counselling services.\nBonitatibus estimates the city is about \"60%\" through its recovery, although fears the environmental impact will last for \"many, many years\".\n\"We have things we need to shift as a community so when the next storm comes we're more prepared,\" she said.\n\"In terms of planting trees again, that's a couple of generations. We lost a 100-year-old on our property.\"\nMasters week, which has been held in Augusta since 1934, has long been one of the biggest economic drivers in the city.\nLast year, Forbes reported it contributes an estimated $120m (\u00a394m) annually., external\nA hefty percentage of the 200,000 population rent out their homes - and land - for players, patrons and the media to lay their heads.\nGiven the devastation, this Masters week holds extra significance and will provide a much-needed financial injection for the thousands affected.\nMany have been hanging on, forlorn and frustrated, in the hope of a positive answer from insurance companies deluged by desperate claims.\n\"The Masters is definitely the time when we put our best foot forward \u2013 and we're doing that again,\" said Bonitatibus.\n\"We're happy it is here \u2013 thank goodness, we need the proper cash. This is a huge opportunity for us to get back right.\"",

        "article_text": "Residential damage in Augusta caused by Hurricane Helene has reached $282m (\u00a3220m)\nThe manicured grass around the entrance to Augusta National is pristine. It always is.\nIn the suburbs which circle the home of the Masters, though, it is a different picture.\nFractured trees sprawl across gardens. Rubbles of wood and brick stack high. Homes remain shattered. So do lives.\nWhen Rory McIlroy and the world's best golfers arrived in Augusta this week, along with an estimated 200,000 fans, the devastation caused by one of the United States' deadliest natural disasters was laid bare before them.\nIn September, Hurricane Helene hit the south-eastern States - leaving death and destruction in its wake.\nAugusta, nicknamed 'The Garden City' because of its natural greenery, felt its mighty force. The residents are still dealing with the effects.\n\"There were multiple hours of 80mph winds which laid all of the forest down,\" lifelong Augusta resident Tonya Bonitatibus told BBC Sport.\n\"A lot of trees fell on top of houses and crushed cars \u2013 I lost my truck. But I was a lucky one.\"\nWhen Helene reached the American coast, it brought extreme winds, numerous tornadoes and flooding across several states. \nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Helene is responsible for at least 249 fatalities in the United States, including at least 175 direct deaths.\nIt was the deadliest hurricane in the US since Katrina in 2005.\nFlorida, on the south-eastern frontier, bore the brunt of the force. But Helene quickly headed further north, engulfing South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia.\nAugusta, which is the third most populous city in Georgia, was attacked by gusts of wind which reached 100mph through the night of 26 September - with stark consequences.\n\"Helene's winds were responsible for killing 11 people - all from trees falling onto homes in the greater Augusta area,\" a spokesperson for the National Hurricane Center told BBC Sport.\n\"At least 362 homes and buildings were destroyed, while 3,000 others suffered major damage, and 3,500 others experienced minor to moderate damage.\"\nAugusta officials say almost 17,000 fallen trees have been removed from the city\nResidents living close to Augusta National had to leave their homes. Thousands were left without electricity and water.\nJoseph Crosby, his wife Kasey and their three children still cannot live in their storm damaged home, about five miles from the iconic course.\nHe recalls watching a mature Ash tree, which he estimates had grown over 60 feet tall, being \"blown around like a rag doll\".\n\"I think your brain compartmentalises what you're going through,\" Joseph recalls of the night itself.\n\"All you think of at that moment is just survival and keeping your kids safe. \n\"I just remember thinking if the tree came down on our house or something were to happen, would my kids be OK?\"\nThe Crosby family home is among 1,695 properties damaged in the city of Augusta. City officials estimate the cost of residential losses has reached $282m (\u00a3220m).\n\"Folks here are resilient but this won't soon be forgotten. It reminds one how frail and furious nature can be,\" local journalist Joe Kovac told BBC Sport.\n\nAugusta National Golf Club was not as badly affected as the suburbs nearby.\nBut it did not escape. \n\"After the storm when you rode around Augusta National, on Washington Road, the pile of trees was above your car for mile after mile,\" said Bonitatibus.\nTrees came down in their hundreds on the famed course, damaging one of golf's most famous greens on the par-three 16th.\nWalking the course now is a lighter, less claustrophobic experience.  \nYou can see through wooded areas that previously screened individual holes and made them their own isolated stations.\nThe separation of the ninth and first fairways is less cluttered. \nComing down the 11th hole it is possible to see into the neighbouring Augusta Country Club course.\nThe wooded area to the right of the newly-laid 16th green will have fewer shadows when the world's best golfers begin their challenge for the famous Green Jacket on Thursday.  \nSpeaking in January, Augusta National Golf Club chairman Fred Ridley said: \"As far as the golf course goes, it's in spectacular condition.\n\"We had minor damage to the course, the playing surfaces themselves, but we were able to get that back in shape.\n\"I don't think you're going to see any difference in the condition for the Masters this year.\"\nKovac, who recently wrote a vivid account of the city's recovery process,, external agreed.\n\"I was struck by how emerald-green it is, at least the periphery. It is as if the grass never flinched,\" said the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter.\n\"The kerbside lawn around the course perimeter looks manicured to the hilt. Only regular patrons will really notice trees are missing.\n\"But further into the miles of neighbourhoods ringing the National one cannot help but see the wreckage and its remains.\"\nDriving around Augusta, it does not take much to notice the roadsides still populated by fallen trees - oaks, ash and giant pines. \nLong established homes bear scars of severe roof damage, much of it protected only by the flimsy tarpaulins.\nLife has been dominated recently by the need to join lengthy queues for construction and repair workers. \n\"It's been a journey, just rebuilding. It's been really neat to see the community come together in a town like this,\" said Kasey Crosby.\n\"We've heard lots of stories of neighbours helping each other.\n\"Cutting neighbours out of their driveways so they can get their cars out and get to work, or to get to the grocery store. \n\"People are pulling together, helping one another with chainsaws and just showing up.\"\nAugusta is described by its government as a 'centre of medicine, manufacturing, and military'. \nHowever, its job market has long been unstable and the city is ranked among the neediest in the US.\nIn December 2023, local newspaper, the Augusta Chronicle, reported it was ranked the nation's fifth worst city for economic well-being.\nChild poverty, food insecurity and unemployment rates were highlighted as particular problems.\nBlue tarpaulin covering the roofs of Augusta houses is a common sight \nAugusta National, which stumped up $20m (\u00a315.8m) in Masters prize money last year, is well aware of its privilege.\nIn the aftermath of Helene, the club provided $5m of financial support to the relief fund.\nBonitatibus, a riverkeeper who looks after the Savannah waterway, says the aid had a \"huge\" impact and reinforced Augusta National's philanthropic role in the community.\nThe money helped provide food, water, laundry, showers and counselling services.\nBonitatibus estimates the city is about \"60%\" through its recovery, although fears the environmental impact will last for \"many, many years\".\n\"We have things we need to shift as a community so when the next storm comes we're more prepared,\" she said.\n\"In terms of planting trees again, that's a couple of generations. We lost a 100-year-old on our property.\"\nMasters week, which has been held in Augusta since 1934, has long been one of the biggest economic drivers in the city.\nLast year, Forbes reported it contributes an estimated $120m (\u00a394m) annually., external\nA hefty percentage of the 200,000 population rent out their homes - and land - for players, patrons and the media to lay their heads.\nGiven the devastation, this Masters week holds extra significance and will provide a much-needed financial injection for the thousands affected.\nMany have been hanging on, forlorn and frustrated, in the hope of a positive answer from insurance companies deluged by desperate claims.\n\"The Masters is definitely the time when we put our best foot forward \u2013 and we're doing that again,\" said Bonitatibus.\n\"We're happy it is here \u2013 thank goodness, we need the proper cash. This is a huge opportunity for us to get back right.\"",

        "article_text": "Take a four-hour slow train through the Eastern Ghats to discover how a remote hill station is changing the global coffee game.\nEven in December, early mornings are rarely pleasant on much of India's Andhra Pradesh coast. The air is already muggy by 06:30 as a crowd mills restlessly on platform five at Visakhapatnam (Vizag) railway station. However, these would-be passengers are no ordinary commuters, but travellers gathered for an experience. When the Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special rolls onto the platform, the crowd's relief is palpable; the two vistadome coaches at the back of the train that they've been anxiously waiting to board are air-conditioned.\u00a0\nIndians have only a nodding acquaintance with the concept of queues, so a mad scramble ensues as the train comes to a halt. Things settle down as it chugs out of the station and gradually picks up speed. The Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special also serves as a regular commuter service headed to the town of Kirandul in Chhattisgarh state, about 400km to the north-west, and takes about 14 hours to traverse the distance. But those in the vistadome coaches are interested only in the first leg, to Araku Valley. This serene hill station is about 120km away but takes four hours as the train winds its way through a whopping 58 tunnels cut through the Eastern Ghats. The two vistadome coaches \u2013 with their extra-large windows and rotatable seats \u2013 are designed to provide panoramic views of the area's mountain peaks and valleys and its gentle forested slopes that end in rushing rivers and streams, gorges and rocky promontories.\nAs the train whizzes past Vizag's neighbourhoods and suburbs, it provides snapshots of a city waking up: a vegetable vendor hauling their cart, a dog walker pulled by his dog, two bleary-eyed uniformed children clutching onto their father on a scooter to school. As the city segues into wide open fields and farmlands, the images change: smoke curls lazily into the sky from a lone thatched house in the middle of a farm, a diligent farmer urges on his oxen, a tractor hauls vegetables to the nearby market. The rhythmic clickety-clack of the train's wheels is familiar and soporific.\u00a0\u00a0\nLess than 30 minutes after leaving Vizag, the train slows considerably and begins ascending into the foothills of the Eastern Ghats. As if on cue, most seats in the coach swing to face the windows. The train climbs, plains fall away and even the sporadic habitations clinging to the peaks vanish. Hills and mountains in the distance appear blue-grey in the tender morning sun. But even before this panorama can register, complete darkness descends as the train enters the route's first tunnel. I'm startled by the sounds of adults and children screaming, in jest of course, for the few minutes it takes for us to come out the other side.\nWhen we emerge into daylight, the sight is jaw-dropping: a series of hillocks and gentle valleys, thickly forested, stretch out to the horizon where a haze-shrouded mountain range is just a hint of the soaring peaks to come. As I try to take in as much of the scene as possible, darkness descends again, and with it, more screaming.\nOn the other side is another surreal and dramatic sight: tracks bent around a hill, a green wall sloping straight up on one side, and a sheer drop on the other. The train slowly chugs forward, hugging the inner curve. The vistadomes' rear position means that the entire length of the train is visible, curling against the hill as if teetering on the edge. It then uncoils and wraps itself on the other side, trundling on a bridge built over a stream that gently flows several metres below. The bridge has no continuous guardrails, so, for a moment, it feels like the train is suspended in the air. But soon, the feeling is interrupted by darkness and more screaming, and another breathtaking view on the other side.\nTrain Journeys\nTrain Journeys is a BBC Travel series that celebrates the world's most interesting train rides and inspires readers to travel overland.\nThis sequence repeats over and over again and yet it never gets predictable or boring. Each of the route's 58 tunnels sets up anticipation for what might lay on the other side. Thick curtains of mist clinging to mountainsides or low-hanging clouds cloaking the peaks; rolling grasslands and forests spread out like someone had shaken out a giant green blanket and laid it down; deep valleys and gorges surrounded by undulating peaks; and fleeting glimpses of hamlets and habitations perched precariously on the hillsides.\u00a0\nWe stop every few minutes to drop and pick up commuters at musical-sounding stations that could be tongue-twisters to those unfamiliar: Pendurthi, Kottavalasa, Chimidipalli, Borraguhallu, Karakavalasa. At Shimiliguda, the station proudly wears its altitude on its sleeve: 996m above sea level. Throughout the journey, there is also a continuous parade of food vendors, delectable aromas wafting from their baskets as they sell idli-vada-chutney (a common breakfast of steamed rice cake with coconut chutney), samosa, savoury puffed rice and boiled peanuts.\nWhen the train finally rolls into Araku town, the station is crowded and noisy and the magic of the journey dissipates somewhat. But early next morning, Araku's appeal is on full display. A short walk leads to forests and coffee plantations speckled with tall silver oak trees, their trunks wrapped by pepper vines. Everything is covered in thick fog and the air is nippy, a far cry from Vizag's mugginess. The air is sappy and thick with terpenes. I catch faint whiffs of coffee and pepper.\nCoffee came to Araku with the British and was grown in scattered patches of plantations. Like other coffee-growing regions in India, Araku was an ideal location owing to its combination of soil, altitude and weather. After independence from British rule in 1947, the land passed into local government hands, but decades of underdevelopment and sporadic insurgency kept the region off most investment maps. That began to change in the early 2000s.\u00a0\n\"The local community wanted progress,\" says Manoj Kumar, CEO of the Naandi Foundation, a non-profit that works with farmers through community initiatives and sustainable models. \"So we looked around and thought since coffee was already growing in pockets, it could be expanded.\"\nWorking with local farmers, the organisation began establishing micro-plots of Arabica coffee using regenerative agriculture. What began at around 1,000 acres in 2002 currently stands at 100,000 acres farmed by more than 90,000 families, who each own about an acre on average. Besides coffee, farmers have been encouraged to multi-crop and now produce pepper, red kidney beans, ginger, turmeric, millets, rice, vegetables, fruits such as chikoo (sapodilla), mango, custard apple and avocado.\u00a0The result: a unique fair-trade coffee model known as Arakunomics, which won the Rockefeller Foundation's Food System Vision 2050 Prize in 2020.\nBut the foundation didn't stop there. In a first for Indian coffee, they \"terroir-mapped\" the beans \u2013 borrowing a concept from winemaking \u2013\u00a0and classified the end product into six distinct flavour profiles under the brand name ARAKU. Selective harvesting, sustainable practices and meticulous post-harvest processes have helped the beans consistently score 91/100 on specialty coffee rankings.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022 Malaysia's iconic 'Jungle Railway'\n\u2022 The Baltic Express: Central Europe's new hop-on hop-off train\n\"We grow about 2,000 metric tons of coffee, 98% of which is sourced by specialty coffee promoters across the world,\" Kumar says.\nTravellers can explore this story at various coffee holdings in the area, but Priya Rajagopal, a coffee enthusiast and former project manager in tech, recommends the Sunkarametta Coffee Plantation, about 13km south-east of Araku, where a wooden bridge runs for a few hundred metres through the plantation, suspended above the coffee plants and flanked by towering silver oaks. \"When I went, it was the flowering season (March to May) and the plants were full of white flowers, \" she says. \"The air is filled with a sweet, jasmine-like smell.\"\nA short distance away, the modest but informative Araku Coffee Museum offers a primer on the journey from seed to cup. The small adjacent caf\u00e9 serves a robust filter brew \u2013 earthy, rich and perfect for a chilly morning in the hills.\u00a0\nA few days after the train trip, back in Bengaluru, I head to the sole ARAKU cafe in India (most of their production is either exported, retailed in stores or available online), which is tucked away in the tree-lined avenues of the city's Indiranagar neighbourhood. I am torn between the various options but opt for their signature medium roast. It is beautifully rich red-brown and utterly mellow on the tongue. More importantly, a subtle peppery end note immediately transports me back to Araku\u2019s mist-covered winding lanes, the lush green forests and plantations \u2013 and the slow, soulful train ride that led me there.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.\nHVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.\nBut industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.\nAnd data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.\nEurope used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.\nIn response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".\nHVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.\nUK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.\nIts green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.\nBut industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.\nThat would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.\nThis palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.\nThey said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.\nAnother whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.\n\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.\n\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"\nAs well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce. \nThe figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.\nEU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.\nBut the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.\nThis mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.\n\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".\n\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.\n\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"\nUnderpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.\nIt is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.\nBut in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.\n\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.\n\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"\nThis concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.\nConstruction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.\n\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.\nThe European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.\nIn a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".\nIn the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.\nThe BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.\nIt would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.\nIn response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".\n\"The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels,\" it said.\nSign up for our

We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals,\" he said.\nTrump said China had introduced its countermeasure \"despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs... will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs\". \nBeijing shot back, saying that \"pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage\".\n\"The US hegemonic move in the name of 'reciprocity' serves its selfish interests at the expense of other countries' legitimate interests and puts 'America first' over international rules,\" Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement. \n\"This is a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\" \nSpeaking from the White House, the US president said there could be both permanent tariffs and negotiations.\n\"We have $36tn (\u00a328tn) debt for a reason,\" he said, adding that the US would be talking to China among other countries to make a \"fair deal and a good deal\".\n\"It's now America first,\" Trump said.\nThe tariffs would come as a major blow to China's manufacturers, for whom the US is a key market for exports.\nChina's top exports to the US include electrical products and other machinery, computers, furniture, toys, vehicles and equipment.\nThe US's top exports to China are oilseeds and grains, as well aircraft, machinery and pharmaceuticals.\nUncertainty around the tariffs led to a turbulent day on global stock markets.\nMarkets worldwide have plunged since Trump announced the global tariffs. \nThe value of US stock markets dropped sharply again on opening on Monday, although they later pared those losses, while Europe's biggest markets, including London's FTSE 100, closed more than 4% down.\nAsian share indexes had nosedived on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling by more than 13%, its biggest one-day fall since 1997. However, most major markets made gains on Tuesday with some notable exceptions.\nThe key index in mainland China was broadly flat on Tuesday morning but there were more losses in Taiwan and Singapore. After being closed for national holidays, Thailand and Indonesia also saw stocks fall by more than 4% and 9% respectively. \nTrump's post on Monday also indicated that negotiations on countries' tariff rates would \"begin taking place immediately\".\nTrump met Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, on Monday in the White House. Netanyahu said that his country would eliminate the trade imbalance with the US, which he said was the \"right thing to do\".\n\"We intend to do it very quickly... and we're going to also eliminate trade barriers.\"\nIsrael faces a 17% tariff from April 9 under Trump's \"Liberation Day\" policy.\nThe US president also posted earlier that Japan was sending a negotiation team to discuss tariffs.\nAnd Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, offered Trump a \"zero-for-zero tariff\" deal - although she previously said that she had not ruled out retaliation. \n\"We are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests,\" she said.\nTrump said later that the EU had been formed \"to really do damage to the United States and trade\".

        "article_text": "A day before Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs are scheduled to kick in, the US president appears locked in a high-stakes game of chicken, with the world's economy hanging in the balance.\nSome nations labelled \"worst offenders\" are scrambling to make nice with the White House to end this game before it reaches a potentially devastating climax.\nChina, in contrast, is playing a different game, one of retaliation and resistance.\nMeanwhile, Trump has pressed ahead, even as some allies \u2013 in Congress and on Wall Street \u2013 wonder if he's going too far. On Sunday, when asked what level of market fall he would tolerate before changing course, he snapped that it was a \"stupid question\".\nSo is it all a negotiating tactic as many investors and politicians hope \u2013 or is he playing a longer game aimed at permanently restructuring the global economy and America's place in it? In this new world, whether a country is an ally or an adversary depends on whether that nation is giving the US a good deal.\nOn Monday afternoon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first world leader to visit the president since his trade announcement, tried his hand at playing Trump's new game. He pledged that his nation \u2013 which has been slotted for tariffs of 17% \u2013 would drop its trade barriers and move to eliminate its trade surplus with the US.\n\"We think it is the right thing to do,\" he said. \"I think Israel can serve as a model to many countries that ought to do the same.\"\nOther nations appear to be pursuing a similar strategy in the hopes of a positive result.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called Trump on Monday morning, prompting Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to state that the US was beginning negotiations with the nation to \"implement the president's vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade\".\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Europe was \"ready to negotiate\" with the US, offering a mutual reduction of tariffs on industrial goods to zero \u2013 a proposal that Trump praised during remarks at the Oval Office, while saying it was still \"not enough\".\nThere were no such gestures from China. On Monday morning, America's top economic competitor announced that it was responding to Trump's 34% tariff increase with an additional 34% of its own.\nThat prompted Trump to threaten another 50% to US tariffs on China if it does not back down by Tuesday.\n\"China has chosen to isolate itself by retaliating and doubling down on previous negative behaviour,\" Bessent posted on X. \"Over 50 countries have responded both openly and positively to Donald Trump's historic action to create a fairer, more prosperous system of global trade.\"\nChina's reaction to Trump's latest move was equally blunt.\n\"We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us,\" Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told BBC partner CBS News. \"China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\"\nSuch a series of reactions and reprisals from China and the US appeared to be exactly what investors feared last week, as American stock indexes dropped by double-digit percentages.\nBy Monday a growing chorus of business leaders were speaking out against Trump's tariff plan, including Wall Street financiers who had been strong public supporters of his administration \u2013 trying, it appeared, to get the president to back down by force of will alone.\nMeanwhile, US markets were poised to jump at any reason for hope. When a social media post on Monday morning indicated that the president was contemplating a 90-day delay on new tariffs \u2013 perhaps drawn from a misinterpretation of comments made by Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett on Fox News - US stock indexes soared. The S&P 500 index added $2.4tn in market value for about 10 minutes, only for it to all vanish once the White House quickly denied the president was contemplating such a move.\nTrump further closed the door on Monday afternoon, saying he was not \"looking at\" any kind of delay. It was still full speed ahead on tariffs.\n\"We're going to have one shot at this,\" he said.\nPerhaps the most concerning message for investors and foreign leaders hoping for a last-minute reprieve \u2013 and an exit ramp to stability - came from one of Trump's top trade advisers, Peter Navarro.\n\"This is not a negotiation,\" he wrote in a Financial Times opinion piece published on Monday afternoon. \"President Trump is always willing to listen. But to those world leaders who, after decades of cheating, are suddenly offering to lower tariffs - know this: that's just the beginning.\"\nSo if this is about the start of broader systemic change \u2013 what is the desired end goal worth potentially tanking the global economy?\nOne theory is that Trump has a plan with several of his top advisers \u2013 the \"Mar-a-Lago accord\", it is called \u2013 with the ultimate goal of compelling America's trading partners to weaken the US dollar on the international currency exchange. Such a move would make American exports more affordable to foreign markets and diminish the value of China's large reserves of US currency.\nIt's a plan pushed by Trump economic adviser Stephen Miran, although he has denied that it is current administration policy.\nThat's just one of the possible explanations for the current stock market mayhem that Trump has purposefully instigated \u2013 one that many other prominent economists warn is risky. It is far from the only one.\nEver since Trump shocked the world with his sweeping tariff plan, White House officials have fanned out across media to preach patience and offer a selection of sometimes contradictory explanations as to the strategy behind Trump's global trade war. He is doing it to raise revenue and protect American industry - or as a negotiating tool. The tariffs are permanent \u2013 or they are temporary. They will prompt individual deals with other nations - or compel some grand multilateral agreement.\nAs Trump presses on to Wednesday's tariff cliff with no signs of backing away, he seems willing to keep the world guessing.",

It brought only more disappointment as Europe's biggest trophy continued to evade PSG.\nThe return to common sense rather than chasing instant results has seen PSG acquire new jewels in their crown such as Doue and Kvaratskhelia. They are now an outstanding team, not simply a collection of superstar individuals.\nThe pair cost \u00a3102m (120m euro) but are talents for now and the future, unlike the \u00a3200m spent signing Neymar from Barcelona in 2017 and the mega-money given to Messi when he 34.\nIt even enabled Luis Enrique to keep the talented Bradley Barcola on the bench.\nDesire Doue translates to 'desire gifted' in English. He has vast reserves of both as Villa found out to their cost ,running them ragged on the flanks, equalising with a sensational curling finish high past a motionless Martinez from 20 yards on an angle.\nThere are rough edges to be smoothed out on the teenager, who drew the ire of France coach Didier Deschamps when he turned up late for his first day with the national squad at their Clairefontaine base before making his debut against Croatia.\nBut he is not short of confidence, stepping forward to score the winning penalty against Liverpool in the shootout at Anfield in the last round.\nDoue's idol is Neymar but he is making a name of his own following his \u00a343m (50m euro) arrival from Rennes last summer.\nWilliam takes eldest son George to watch Villa in Paris\nMendes' late strike puts PSG in control against Villa\n'We believe in Villa Park' - can Emery's men rescue tie?\nThis video can not be played\nDoue 'unleashes a brilliant finish' to bring PSG level\nPSG beat Bayern Munich to Doue's signature based on last season at Rennes. He scored four goals and had four assists in 31 Ligue 1 appearances with 17 starts last term, but also created 27 chances from open play.\nThis season he has reached another level, having created the most open play chances per 90 minutes of anyone in Europe's top five leagues - 2.6 based on having played a minimum of 750 minutes.\nThis term, among midfielders and forwards, only Ousmane Dembele (13.5) has averaged more progressive ball carries than his 12.4 per 90 minutes in Ligue 1.\nDoue has an impressive 22 goal involvements this season at a rate of one every 105.8 minutes, evenly split into 11 goals and 11 assists. Only Dembele (39) and Barcola (33) have contributed to more goals for PSG this season.\nHe has scored in each of his past four appearances for PSG in all competitions with five goals, and now has 13 goal involvements in his past 12 games, with eight goals and five assists.\nDoue is a free spirit in possession with a devastating turn of pace and glorious touch, and has a golden future.\nAlongside him, and a constant threat to Villa, was 24-year-old Kvaratskhelia, whose occasionally languid, jinking style cannot disguise the sort of natural gifts that saw him earn the nickname 'Kvaradona' when he came to prominence at Diego Maradona's former club Napoli. There, he tormented Liverpool when Jurgen Klopp's team were beaten 4-1 in Italy in the Champions League in 2021.\nHe troubled Matty Cash throughout the first half before the defender was substituted, but his replacement Axel Disasi was outmanoeuvred instantly by the Georgian, twisting and turning the defender before unleashing an unstoppable shot high past Martinez.\nAdd in Dembele, who is finally fulfilling all that was predicted for him when he was at Barcelona, and PSG currently have claim to be Europe's best team.\nThey thrashed Manchester City 4-2 here in the new league table format stage, then recovered from losing at home to a late Liverpool smash-and-grab before winning at Anfield and going through on penalties.\nNow, at last, there is real belief that PSG are finally ready to put their years of Champions League suffering behind them and win Europe's elite trophy.\nPSG are a joy to watch under Luis Enrique, who won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, and the vast bowl of Parc des Princes is a cauldron of noise and expectation.\nThere was even a nod to Birmingham-based TV series Peaky Blinders for Villa before kick-off, when a giant tifo emblazoned with a skull wearing a flat cap bearing the message \"By Order Of The PSG SG Fans\" was unfurled.\nPSG delivered in style, running Villa ragged as Unai Emery made an unhappy return to the club where he spent two seasons. Villa gave game chase, but ultimately PSG were too good.\nThey posted a passing accuracy of 94.5% in this match, their highest on record in a single Champions League game, the fifth highest overall and the second highest in a knockout stage game - all since 2003-04.\nPSG had 29 shots to Aston Villa's seven. It is a sign of their potency that this was the fifth time since the start of last season they have had 20 or more shots than their opponents in a Champions League match, the joint-most of any side with Manchester City.\nAnd Dembele created nine chances against Villa, the most on record (since 2003-04) in a Champions League match for PSG, and the most by a player overall since Joshua Kimmich for Bayern Munich against PSG in April 2021, when he created 10.\nIn the past 10 seasons, PSG have reach one final - losing to Bayern Munich in 2020 - two semi-finals, two quarter-finals and gone out five times in the last-16 stage of the Champions League.\nOn this compelling evidence, they may at last be ready to take the final step.\nDiscipline, injuries & family - how Dembele turned career around\nAn obsessive who lived through tragedy - can Luis Enrique deliver PSG dream?\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals,\" he said.\nTrump said China had introduced its countermeasure \"despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs... will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs\". \nBeijing shot back, saying that \"pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage\".\n\"The US hegemonic move in the name of 'reciprocity' serves its selfish interests at the expense of other countries' legitimate interests and puts 'America first' over international rules,\" Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement. \n\"This is a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\" \nSpeaking from the White House, the US president said there could be both permanent tariffs and negotiations.\n\"We have $36tn (\u00a328tn) debt for a reason,\" he said, adding that the US would be talking to China among other countries to make a \"fair deal and a good deal\".\n\"It's now America first,\" Trump said.\nThe tariffs would come as a major blow to China's manufacturers, for whom the US is a key market for exports.\nChina's top exports to the US include electrical products and other machinery, computers, furniture, toys, vehicles and equipment.\nThe US's top exports to China are oilseeds and grains, as well aircraft, machinery and pharmaceuticals.\nUncertainty around the tariffs led to a turbulent day on global stock markets.\nMarkets worldwide have plunged since Trump announced the global tariffs. \nThe value of US stock markets dropped sharply again on opening on Monday, although they later pared those losses, while Europe's biggest markets, including London's FTSE 100, closed more than 4% down.\nAsian share indexes had nosedived on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling by more than 13%, its biggest one-day fall since 1997. However, most major markets made gains on Tuesday with some notable exceptions.\nThe key index in mainland China was broadly flat on Tuesday morning but there were more losses in Taiwan and Singapore. After being closed for national holidays, Thailand and Indonesia also saw stocks fall by more than 4% and 9% respectively. \nTrump's post on Monday also indicated that negotiations on countries' tariff rates would \"begin taking place immediately\".\nTrump met Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, on Monday in the White House. Netanyahu said that his country would eliminate the trade imbalance with the US, which he said was the \"right thing to do\".\n\"We intend to do it very quickly... and we're going to also eliminate trade barriers.\"\nIsrael faces a 17% tariff from April 9 under Trump's \"Liberation Day\" policy.\nThe US president also posted earlier that Japan was sending a negotiation team to discuss tariffs.\nAnd Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, offered Trump a \"zero-for-zero tariff\" deal - although she previously said that she had not ruled out retaliation. \n\"We are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests,\" she said.\nTrump said later that the EU had been formed \"to really do damage to the United States and trade\".

They called him Neymar.\"\nZiguinchor is situated on the Casamance River in southern Senegal\nThe comparisons to Brazil's all-time top scorer may not have stuck, but Jackson has shown dedication worthy of top professionals.\n\"He lived with his mother, cousins and uncles, which kept him grounded,\" Sarr said.\n\"I can't remember him ever being late for training.\"\nFrom Casa Sports, Jackson's application earned him a move to La Liga club Villarreal aged 18.\n\"He told [his family] he wouldn't come back until he made it,\" Birane Hady Cisse, the sports editor at Senegalese news agency 373/500, told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"He's undoubtedly one of the top players we have now.\"\nDiomansy Kamara, who won a half-century of caps for Senegal, was instrumental in that transfer to Spain, with Cisse claiming the former Fulham and West Brom forward's guidance has been crucial.\n\"He understood how things worked in Europe and picked the best place for Jackson to develop, without focusing too much on where he could make money right away.\"\nJackson failed to find the net in his first 10 games for Villarreal's first team\nYet Jackson's European dream looked on shaky ground, as he alternated between Villarreal's youth and B teams while adapting to his new surroundings.\n\"When he came he was shy and looked raw,\" Javier Sidro, who covers the Yellow Submarine as the head of sports at Radio Castellon Cadena SER, told the BBC.\n\"But he paid attention and was always willing to improve.\"\nSecond-tier outfit Mirandes turned down the chance to sign Jackson permanently after just one goal in 17 outings on loan.\nBut such things can be a blessing in disguise, and Jackson returned to Villarreal knowing it was make or break.\nHe was eventually handed his first-team debut by Unai Emery as a late substitute against Real Betis in October 2021.\n\"In the weeks leading up to that, Emery had been preparing him as he liked his movement and saw the potential for greatness,\" Sidro revealed.\n\"It was interesting to keep an eye on him. He was capable of generating chances and looked really strong, but there was work to be done on his finishing.\"\nJackson was consigned to fleeting appearances from the bench for the rest of the season, with injuries also restricting his progress.\nJackson won his first cap for Senegal at the 2022 Fifa World Cup when he appeared against the Netherlands\nHe began the next campaign strongly, netting on his first La Liga start, but Emery's work to fully integrate him into the side ended when he left for Aston Villa in October 2022.\n\"Quique Setien replaced Emery and he saw something in Jackson too - a player who was clearly talented but hadn't yet reached his potential,\" Sidro said.\nJackson made his senior debut for Senegal at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and Premier League clubs were starting to take notice.\nBournemouth agreed a fee of more than \u00a320m ($25.9m) to sign him in January 2023 but injury meant the deal fell through - with the Cherries snapping up Ghana forward Antoine Semenyo from Bristol City instead.\nOnce again, a failed transfer brought the best out of the Senegalese in the second half of that season.\n\"Jackson exploded, not instantly, but gradually,\" Sidro explained. \"Once he started, he was really unstoppable.\"\nNine goals in the final eight games of the La Liga campaign helped Villarreal finish fifth and qualify for the Europa League.\nChelsea, who at the time were changing their model to target young players, secured his services in June 2023, handing Jackson an eight-year contract.\nJackson's undulating career at Chelsea has seen him look like a world-beater in some games while showing naivety in others.\nHowever, he netted 14 league goals in his debut campaign and former Senegal striker Demba Ba, who spent 18 months with the Blues, thinks there is no doubt that Jackson will be a long-term success in west London.\n\"At Villarreal he was really good at making that final turn, and he'll be great at Chelsea,\" Ba said.\n\"He just needs to keep working hard and remember that he has to score goals.\"\nCould this season's run-in provide Jackson with the stage to prove that he is the real deal?\nShould he lead the Blues to a top-four finish, or score the goals that clinch a first trophy since 2021, then the boy from Ziguinchor may finally silence his doubters.",

That is when there is expectation to win. That is when the fans are on you. There are 20 minutes to go, it's 0-0 or you are getting beaten. The pressure is heaped on you. Have you got it in you to stand up and be counted?\nThat is what makes or breaks a Rangers player. And, in this squad, there are not enough players with the mentality to get through those periods. That for me is where this squad is at - and that is the aspect that has let them down.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app\nThis video can not be played\nSaturday's loss to Hibernian set an unwanted Rangers record of five straight home defeats\nThat is separate to the technical attributes of these players, though. They are good footballers. They have shown that in European games. They have shown that against Celtic. \nIt was only last month they knocked Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce out of the Europa League and went to Celtic Park and won for the first time in years.\nBut those games bring a different pressure. They bring a different expectation. Going into big European games, especially in the knockout rounds, rarely is there expectancy on Rangers to win.\nMeanwhile, domestically, they simply need to win, win, win. Their tempo needs to be high. They need to commit more bodies forward. \nHow many times have you watched a Rangers game where their two centre-halves are in the attacking half against one striker? That is because, in basic terms, they have to commit more in an attacking sense.\nBut you are at risk if you lose the ball. Just look at Hibernian's second goal on Saturday. It comes from a point where Rangers' defensive-minded players are in Hibs' half.\nIn Europe, you will rarely see that situation with a Rangers team, because they have more focus on the defensive side of their game.\nThe easier thing to do in football is be a defensive team. That is what I think this Rangers team are more comfortable doing. They feel more at ease playing in a defensively organised team that can then counter-attack. \nWhy is it easier? Well, in those moments, you are not coaching a set pattern to break a team down. When that is your gameplan, inevitably when you get possession, the opposition are not set up to be broken down. \nThese Rangers players are intelligent footballers. They get the gameplan of stopping the opposition and being clinical on the counter. They have shown that under Barry Ferguson away to Fenerbahce and Celtic playing in a 3-4-3 set-up.\nIn those games, when Rangers have won the ball, they have been in positions to score goals because even when they are sitting deep in a defensive formation, they always have three attackers forward.\nDefensively, they have more players deeper in the pitch and enough bodies to defend. And, in the attacking sense, having one striker and two number 10s means it is not just Cyriel Dessers or Vaclav Cerny running forward themselves.\nRangers' average player positions in last month's 3-1 win at Fenerbahce (left) and Saturday's defeat at home to Hibs (right) show a stark contrast between where their defensive line typically sits in European and domestic games\nThat approach did not work so well in the home leg against Fenerbahce, or the first half of their league game at Dundee, when they were perhaps expected to take the game to the opposition.\nBut for Thursday's encounter with Athletic Bilbao, I feel the first leg being at home should suit Rangers.\nMost European games that are two-legged affairs, particular in the latter stages of competitions, the first leg is always more cagey. It will probably be accepted a bit more by the Ibrox crowd if Rangers are a bit more solid. \nRangers would bite your hand off to go into that second leg in Bilbao at 0-0. But, make no mistake about it, this will be their toughest European game to date this season. \nThey are going to face a seriously technical team who are fourth in Spain's top flight. They have a top, top coach like Ernesto Valverde - a two-time La Liga winner as Barcelona boss - and they play with good tempo in their approach. \nThat is their model and how they play, so expect their set-up behind the ball to be really good if counter-attack opportunities arise for Rangers.\nThere is no getting away from how big a task this is for Ferguson and his unpredictable players, but that is not to say they cannot hurt them - they can.\nFormer Rangers striker Steven Naismith was speaking to BBC Sport Scotland's Nick McPheat",

        "article_text": "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.\nHVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.\nBut industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.\nAnd data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.\nEurope used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.\nIn response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".\nHVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.\nUK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.\nIts green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.\nBut industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.\nThat would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.\nThis palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.\nThey said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.\nAnother whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.\n\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.\n\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"\nAs well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce. \nThe figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.\nEU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.\nBut the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.\nThis mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.\n\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".\n\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.\n\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"\nUnderpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.\nIt is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.\nBut in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.\n\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.\n\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"\nThis concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.\nConstruction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.\n\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.\nThe European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.\nIn a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".\nIn the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.\nThe BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.\nIt would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.\nIn response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".\n\"The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels,\" it said.\nSign up for our

        "article_text": "It's having a moment with celebrities, fashionistas and Gen Z. But wearing any kind of fur, from vintage to synthetic, poses some difficult questions. Could a new plant-based faux fur be the way forward?\nFrom Tory Burch in New York and Simone Rocha in London, to Fendi in Milan and Miu Miu in Paris, fur dominated the autumn/winter 2025-26 catwalks. And celebrities matched the runways, with Hailey Bieber, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift and Rihanna all spending the start of the year wrapped up in faux and vintage fur coats.\nThe last time fur hit the headlines was in 2017, when Gucci pledged to go fur-free, influencing a host of designer brands to follow suit. The move was welcomed by animal rights campaigners, but what followed was the scaling of a new problem: much of the real fur has been replaced by synthetic alternatives that are derived from fossil fuels. Given the tensions around animal welfare and the environment, why is fur now firmly back in fashion?\nIt began in early 2024 with the arrival of the mob wife aesthetic, an ostentatious, glamorous response to the understated, minimalist trend that preceded it: stealth wealth. \"Reviving historical looks for contemporary wear is a natural part of the fashion cycle. It's escapism, and who doesn't want some of that?\" says Natascha Radclyffe-Thomas, associate professor, MBA fashion business and entrepreneurship, at Ravensbourne University, London. \"I was in the room when [former CEO] Marco Bizzarri announced Gucci would no longer use animal fur in its collections, and remember what an amazing shift this was for an Italian luxury brand where fur was such a prevalent material. But the topic of faux fur is such a tricky one, too.\"\nRadclyffe-Thomas adds that, since designer labels' decision to ban real fur from their collections, the faux-fur market has evolved from the early days of \"fun\" fur \u2013 low cost, often in bright colours that didn't attempt to imitate the real thing \u2013 to a new level of quality where most consumers wouldn't know the difference between real and fake.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe production of fossil fuel-based fabrics continues to rise globally, with polyester the most common, accounting for 57% of all fibre production. Even clothing made from recycled polyester is problematic because the model isn't circular. The vast majority is made using plastic bottles \u2013\u00a0 not old textiles \u2013 which means that it can't be recycled again, and will most likely end up in landfill at some point.\nOne way to keep faux fur out of landfill \u2013\u00a0 or delay its final destination \u2013 is to keep it in circulation. At fashion rental company By Rotation, the rental of faux fur and wool coats has been increasing since even before the recent catwalk shows. London label Charlotte Simone \u2013\u00a0 whose faux fur coats have been worn by Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa and Madonna \u2013 is the third most rented brand across coats and jackets. \"Higher quality, well-made faux fur, especially from designer brands, tends to last longer, meaning it's more likely to be passed down, resold or rented rather than discarded,\" By Rotation founder and CEO, Eshita Kabra-Davies, tells the BBC.\nThe global second hand clothing market is expected to reach $367bn by 2029, with a record number of shoppers having bought pre-loved clothes in 2024. This year, since the autumn/winter 2025-26 collections were shown, searches for both real and faux fur have spiked at rental platforms and online retailers.\u00a0\nHolly Watkins, owner of vintage boutique One Scoop Store in north London, says that in the past few years she has seen a considerable shift away from selling real fur to fake alternatives, in response to changing tastes and demands from her customers. \"I only sell real fur if it's a super-special vintage piece which I can't say no to, or has a detachable collar or trim,\" she tells the BBC. \"Personally, I don't have a problem with old [real] fur \u2013 it's better to prolong its life than send it to landfill. I have more of a problem with polyester, in that it will never biodegrade.\"\nBut from conversations with vintage dealers in west London\u00a0\u2013 home to the likes of Portobello market \u2013 Watkins says that many stores have never stopped selling real fur, both old and new, with younger shoppers helping to drive the trend.\u00a0\n\"Fashion turned on fur. Young customers want more\" was the headline of a recent Wall Street Journal article \u2013 and the consensus does seem to be that Gen Z is leading the revival of vintage fur. Madison Avenue Furs, the largest buyer of pre-owned fur in the US, reports a significant uplift in sales, particularly of pre-owned pieces. \"We saw college students coming in to buy fur, which we haven't seen in years,\" Larry Cowit, owner of Madison Avenue Furs, tells the BBC. \"The vintage furs against the new furs was a concern for many of the younger buyers and \u2013 ethically \u2013 they were comfortable with vintage.\"\nCustomers are buying vintage furs across the board, says Cowit, including mink, fox and beaver in oversized silhouettes \u2013 from the likes of Christian Dior, Fendi, Oscar de la Renta, Prada and YSL. \"Once these brands come in, they go rather quickly.\"\nOn the catwalks at the recent fashion weeks, much of the fur was faux, although among the headlines at Paris Fashion Week was a mink coat made from real vintage fur at Gabriela Hearst, a designer label that positions itself as \"luxury with a conscience\".\nAnimal rights campaigners don't accept the vintage argument. \"Regardless of when the damage was done, vintage fur remains clothing made from the skin of a needlessly killed and caged animal,\" says Emma H\u00e5kansson, founder of Collective Fashion Justice. \"It is an ongoing symbol of human supremacy over other animals, and we should not accept that in the 21st Century when we have myriad other options without animal exploitation, wildlife killing or factory farming.\"\nAmong the new-generation alternatives to fossil-fuel-made fur and real animal skin is Savian, a 100% plant-based fur made from nettle, flax and hemp sourced from Europe and produced in Italy. Developed by material science company BioFluff, Savian launched in the form of a longline coat by Stella McCartney during COP28 in November 2023, and was later used in 2024 by Danish fashion brand Ganni to create a collection of bags for Copenhagen Fashion Week.\n\"We are working with several fashion brands across the luxury, contemporary and accessible markets to develop materials that are suited to their needs,\" BioFluff co-founder Roni Gamzon tells the BBC, adding that cost remains a challenge to scaling up the adoption of new-gen materials. \"So many brands have built a reliance on low-cost synthetic materials manufactured at mass in the Far East, making it impossible for us to compete purely on pricing.\"\nBioFluff is part of La Maison des Startups, a programme from LVMH to help accelerate the implementation of new solutions within its portfolio of brands, which includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi and C\u00e9line. Conversely, LVMH also helps to fund The International Fur Federation, paying \u20ac300,000 ($318,000) for Furmark membership, a global certification and traceability system for real fur.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Ten items in your wardrobe is enough \u2013 here's why\n\u2022 The Indigenous-American supermodel bringing change\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\nThe argument that synthetic fur has a higher environmental impact than real fur is questioned by a 2013 scientific study, which compared the impact of natural mink fur coats against that of faux fur coats, and found that the production of natural mink fur had the highest climate impact.

        "article_text": "Todd Brayman is no longer buying his favourite red wine, which is from California.\nA veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, he is one of a growing number of people in Canada, Europe, and other parts of the world, who are avoiding buying US products due to President Trump's tariffs and treatment of US allies.\n\"I have in my life served alongside American forces. It is just profoundly upsetting and disappointing to see where we are given the historical ties that our two countries have,\" says Mr Brayman, who lives in Nova Scotia.\n\"But I think right now it's time to stand up and be counted, and in my mind, that means buying local and supporting Canadian business.\"\nTogether with his wife, Mr Brayman has replaced all the American products he used to buy, including his previous wine of choice, with Canadian alternatives.\n\"Luckett Phone Box Red wine, which is from right here in Nova Scotia, is great,\" he says.\nDetermining which products are Canadian isn't always easy however. \"Sometimes labelling can be misleading,\" adds Mr Brayman.\nTo help, he now uses an app on his phone that can scan a product's barcode and identify where it's from. If the product is identified as American, the app suggests Canadian alternatives.\nThe app, called Maple Scan, is one of numerous emerging in Canada to help people shop local. Others include Buy Canadian, Is This Canadian? and Shop Canadian.\nMaple Scan's founder, Sasha Ivanov, says his app has had 100,000 downloads since it launched last month. He believes the momentum around buying Canadian is here to stay.\n\"Lots of Canadians have told me, 'I'm not going back'. It's important that we support local regardless,\" he says.\nCanadians like Mr Brayman are boycotting American products in response to a raft of import tariffs introduced by Trump. These included tariffs of 25% on all foreign cars, steel and aluminium, and 25% tariffs on other Canadian and Mexican goods.\nMeanwhile, other European Union exports will get tariffs of 20%, while the UK is facing 10%.\nTrump says the tariffs will boost US manufacturing, raise tax revenue and reduce the US trade deficit. However, they have spooked global markets, which have fallen sharply over the past month.\nTrump has even expressed a desire for Canada to join the US as its 51st state, something the Canadian government was quick to strongly reject.\nOttawa has also responded with C$60bn ($42bn; \u00a332bn) in counter tariffs, as well as additional tariffs on the US auto sector.\nAnd there has been a substantial drop in the number of Canadians travelling to the US.\nGroups dedicated to boycotting US goods have also emerged in European countries. Momentum behind the boycott is particularly strong in Denmark, whose territory of Greenland Trump has said he wants to acquire.\nDenmark's largest grocery store operator, Salling Group, recently introduced a symbol, a black star, on pricing labels to denote European brands.\nBo Albertus, a school principal who lives in Skovlunde, a suburb of Copenhagen, says joining the boycott was his way of taking action. \"Statements that Trump made about wanting to buy Greenland, that was just too much for me,\" he says.\n\"I can't do anything about the American political system, but I can vote with my credit card.\"\nOne of Mr Albertus's first moves was to cancel his subscriptions to US streaming services, including Netflix, Disney Plus and Apple TV. \"My 11-year-old daughter is a bit annoyed about it, but that's the way it is. She understands why I do it,\" he says.\nMr Albertus is the administrator for a Danish Facebook group dedicated to helping people boycott US goods. In the group, which has 90,000 members, people share recommendations for local alternatives to US goods, from shoes to lawnmowers.\nMr Albertus says: \"It's a movement that is quite a lot bigger than just our little country, so it all that adds up.\"\nMette Heerulff Christiansen, the owner of a grocery shop in Copenhagen called Broders has stopped stocking American products, such as Cheetos crisps and Hershey's chocolate, in her store. She is substituting them with Danish or European products where possible.\nMs Christiansen is also swapping out products she uses at home. She's finding some easier to replace than others. \"Coca-Cola is easy to substitute with Jolly Cola, a Danish brand,\" she says. \"But technology, like Facebook, that's totally difficult to avoid.\"\nShe believes the boycott movement in Denmark is helping people to channel their anger at Trump's policies and rhetoric. \"I think it's more for the Danish people to feel good that they are doing something,\" she says.\nDouglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, who specializes in the history of US trade policy, believes the economic impact of the boycott may be limited. \"It is hard to judge how economically significant the consumer boycotts will be in terms of reducing trade with the United States,\" he says.\n\"In the past, boycotts have not lasted long and have not achieved much. It starts as a hostile reaction to some US action but tends to fade with time,\" he says.\nFor now though, the rising Buy Canadian sentiment in Canada is boosting sales for many local brands. The CEO of Canadian grocer Loblaw posted on LinkedIn that weekly sales of Canadian products were up by double digits.\nBianca Parsons, from Alberta in Canada, is behind an initiative to promote locally-made goods, called Made In Alberta, which she says has had a surge in interest since the tariffs were introduced. \"We're now getting over 20,000 hits [to the site] every two weeks.\"\nMs Parsons, who is the executive director of the Alberta Food Processors Association, adds: \"I've had producers reach out to us and say: 'I'm selling out at stores that I would never sell out before, thank you so much'.\"\nSeveral Canadian provinces, including Ontario and Nova Scotia, have removed US-made alcoholic beverages from their liquor store shelves in response to tariffs, a move the boss of Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman has said is \"worse than tariffs\".\nAmong the American businesses feeling the impact is Caledonia Spirits, a distiller based in Vermont, near the Canadian border.  Ryan Christiansen, Caledonia's president and head distiller, says his business had an order on track for shipment to Quebec cancelled directly after tariffs were announced.\n\"My sense is that everyone's just being a little too aggressive and, unfortunately, I think America started that,\" says Mr Christiansen. \"I do understand that the action America took needed a counter reaction.\n\"If it were up to me, I'd be at the table trying to resolve this in a friendly way, and I'm hopeful that the leaders in America take that approach.\"\nEthan Frisch, the co-founder of Burlap & Barrel, an American spice company based in New York, which also exports to Canada, says he's more concerned with the impact of the tariffs on his company's imports and rising inflation in the US than the consumer boycott.\nHe says: \"I think there's this assumption that, if you boycott an American company, it's going to have an impact on the economy and maybe change the situation. I think that assumption, unfortunately, is not accurate.\n\"The [US] economy is crashing all up by itself. Businesses like ours are struggling without boycotts.\"",

        "article_text": "Chef Ruben Bond\u00ec knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.\nIn 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church, in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving \u2013 and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.\nFor Ruben Bond\u00ec, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, the tradizione giudaico-romanesca (Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset of Roman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.\n\"Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,\" says Bond\u00ec, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. \"Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.\"\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Maurizio Fiorino)\nRuben Bond\u00ec is a Roman chef and food influencer whose cooking videos have earned him more than four million followers on social media. In 2023, he published a cookbook on Jewish Roman cuisine, Cucina con Ruben.\nDeveloped over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes \u2013 expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy \u2013 from carciofi alla giudia (fried artichokes) to stracotto (braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.\n\"Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing \u2013 typical [Jewish] dishes like concia di zucchine [marinated fried courgettes] and abbacchio [roasted lamb] with potatoes.\"\nBut behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history \u2013 from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 \u2013 Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.\n\"In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so] the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.\"\nToday, Rome's former ghetto \u2013 sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace \u2013 is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.\nHere are Bond\u00ec's top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.\nLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near the Tempio Maggiore synagogue and Porticus Octaviae \u2013 the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol \u2013 Ba'Ghetto is just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.\nDon't get your artichokes off-season\nWhile artichokes may be the undeniable star of the Roman Jewish kitchen, Bond\u00ec recommends visitors only consume the vegetable when it's in harvest. \"Avoid getting artichokes when they're off-season,\" he advises. \"You won't be served Italian artichokes, and they won't be as fresh. You should only get them when it's artichoke season, so from November-December to May.\"\n\"They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.\"\nAmong its Roman Jewish staples is carciofi alla giudia \u2013 a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.\nThe restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes like spaghetti alla carbonara and bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.\n\"Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nBa'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches in Venice, Florence and Milan. Its main restaurant \u2013 a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures \u2013 does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearby Ba'Ghetto Milky.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.baghetto.com\nAddress: Via del Portico D'Ottavia, 57, 00186 / Via del Portico D'Ottavia 2/A (Ba'Ghetto Milky)Phone:  +39 06 9674 0389 / 06 6830 0077 (Ba'Ghetto Milky)\nInstagram: @baghettorestaurants/\nRoman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.\nSo when local institution Renato al Ghetto \u2013 where Bond\u00ec worked as a waiter in his younger days \u2013 realised it could replicate its success with street food, its\u00a0hole-in-the-wall \"Rosetteria\" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.\n\"Rosette are a type of Roman bap,\" Bond\u00ec says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. \"I'd recommend beef stracotto or Roman artichokes.\"\nAmong the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chicken alla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under \u20ac12 (\u00a310).\n\"It's very good,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.\"\nAddress: Via di S.

As with other restaurants in the area, BellaCarne has also dedicated itself to street food, and you can find take-out options and lunchboxes at their grab-and-go spot, BellaCarne Street Food.\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.bellacarne.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 51, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 683 3104\nInstagram: \n@bellacarne/\nThe dishes of Roman cuisine are famous throughout Italy for being hearty and expressly casereccio \u2013 homestyle, homemade.\nCasalino, whose name evokes the warmth of the Italian lunch table, promises a cosy dining experience, and its oak floorings and earthy colours create an inviting ambiance.\n\"It's hearty, homey Jewish Roman food,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nThe restaurant was opened by the Zarfati family in 2021, after the opening of their successful Dolce Kosher bakery, and follows the recipes of the household matriarch, nonna Letizia.\nAmong its dishes are distinctive spins on local classics, such as salt-cured cod with tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins; butter and truffle tonnarelli pasta; and the must-have carciofi alla giudia. Bond\u00ec emphatically recommends Casalino's roasts, but notes that the Zarfati family tightly guards the recipe.\n\"It's a secret,\" he says.\nWebsite: https://casalinoosteriakosher.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 1e, 00186\nPhone number: +39 06 7978 1514\nInstagram: @casalino.osteriakosher/\nWhile most of the quarter's restaurants follow kosher food rules (including forbidding pork and the preparation of meat and dairy products together), Il Giardino Romano has adapted the Roman Jewish culinary tradition for a secular palate.\n\"It's the only Roman Jewish restaurant that isn't kosher,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nAs its name suggests, Il Giardino Romano (\"The Roman Garden\") has a green thumb \u2013 its menu focuses heavily on vegetables, from chicory and courgettes to artichokes, which Bond\u00ec calls the restaurant's speciality.\nThe mighty artichoke is a recurring character in many of the restaurant's takes on traditional Italian and Roman Jewish dishes that don't typically warrant its use \u2013 from fettuccine alle vongole (pasta with clams) to cacio e pepe to even more idiosyncratic pairings.\n\"[Il Giardino Romano] has a particularly unique dessert,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"A ricotta crostata with artichoke.\"\nAnd if the menu does not succeed in evoking the bucolic delights of the Roman orchard, its setting certainly will \u2013 the restaurant has a small brick courtyard covered in trees and hanging ivy.\nWebsite:https://www.ilgiardinoromano.com\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia 18, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 6880 9661\nInstagram: @ristorante_il_giardino_romano/\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause \u2013 news that triggered a brief stock market surge.\nBut now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait.\nThe White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along. \n\"We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement.\nThat framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement. \nSo was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's \"art of the deal\" negotiating strategy at work?\nIt didn't take long for Trump's aides \u2013 many of the same people who said he would never back down \u2013 to fan out and celebrate the president's move.\nTrade adviser Peter Navarro said Trump's tariff situation \"unfolded exactly the way it should\".\n\"You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a crowd of gathered reporters. \"The entire world is calling the United States of America.\"\nThey were less clear about the details of Trump's tariff suspension, announced via a post on his Truth Social website. Did the reprieve in higher tariffs apply to the EU? Were Mexico and Canada, which had avoided the original 10% baseline tariffs, somehow now included? Were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected?\nUltimately, the White House provided some clarity on these questions \u2013 but for hours US trading partners were left to scrutinise Trump's Truth Social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Trump acknowledged that the markets had looked \"pretty glum\" and that \"people were getting a little queasy\" \u2013 a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course.\nEarlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to \"BE COOL!\" and promising that \"everything is going to work out\". And on Monday he lashed out at what he called \"panicans\" - a party based on \"weak and stupid people\" who weren't patient with his efforts. \nIn the end, it was Trump who made an abrupt change of course.\nHe insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the American economy.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of \"governing by chaos\".\n\"He is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing,\" he said.\nIn the end, the thought process behind Trump's decision may not really matter. \nThe reality is that the US is now making nice \u2013 or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though Trump is still imposing a 10% across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago. \nIt is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs.\nThat will have global economic repercussions of its own, but it is more in line with recent American foreign policy - including that of Democratic President Joe Biden - as it seeks to constrain Chinese ambitions.\nThe big unknown, however, is whether Trump's actions over the past week \u2013 setting allies scrambling and threatening the established global order \u2013 will have made such a strategy more difficult to pursue. \nAnd in 90 days, when Trump's pause expires, this week's economic drama and uncertainty could begin all over again.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Constructed by a mysterious civilisation that left no written records, the massive site is now open to the public for the first time in more than a century.\nAutumn leaves crackled under our shoes as dozens of eager tourists and I followed a guide along a grassy mound. We stopped when we reached the opening of a turf-topped circle, which was formed by another wall of mounded earth. We were at The Octagon, part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, a large network of hand-constructed hills spread throughout central and southern Ohio that were built as many as 2,000 years ago. Indigenous people would come to The Octagon from hundreds of miles away, gathering regularly for shared rituals and worship.\u00a0\n\"There was a sweat lodge or some kind of purification place there,\" said our guide, Brad Lepper, senior archaeologist for the Ohio History Connection's World Heritage Program (OHC), as he pointed to the circle. I looked inside to see a perfectly manicured lawn \u2013 a putting green. A tall flag marked a hole at its centre.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's because from 1910 through 2024, The Octagon had been used as a golf course. But on 1 January 2025, this ancient, enigmatic site reopened to visitors for the first time in more than a century.\nAll these prehistoric ceremonial earthworks in Ohio were created by what is now called the Hopewell Culture, a network of Native American societies that gathered from as far away as Montana and the Gulf of Mexico between roughly 100 BCE and 500 CE and were connected by a series of trade routes. Their earthworks in Ohio consist of shapes \u2013 like circles, squares and octagons \u2013 that were often connected to each other. Archaeologists are only now beginning to understand the sophistication of these engineering marvels.\nBuilt with astonishing mathematical precision, as well as a complex astronomical alignment, these are the largest geometrical earthworks in the world that were not built as fortifications or defensive structures. And while most people have never heard about the sites or its builders, that may be about to change.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nIn 2023, eight of Hopewell's earthworks were inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage site. These include The Great Circle and The Octagon in Newark, Ohio, as well Ohio's first state park, Fort Ancient (not an actual fort). The other five are part of the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park: Mound City, Hopeton Earthworks, High Bank Works, Hopewell Mound Group and Seip Earthworks.\u00a0\nLepper told me The Octagon and The Great Circle were once a larger, single Hopewell complex spanning 4.5 square miles and connected by a series of roads lined by earthwork walls. Walking through both sites today, there is an immediate shock of scale. The Great Circle, where the museum for Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks is found, is 1,200ft in diameter. Its walls rise up to 14ft high and are outlined on the inside by a deep ditch. The Great Circle was once connected to a square and a burial ellipse, with only part of the square still visible today.\u00a0The Octagon sprawls a massive 50 acres and is attached to the 20-acre Observatory Circle, a large earthwork circle for gathering and rituals connected to the observation of the night sky.\n\"You could put four Roman Colosseums inside just The Octagon,\" Lepper told me. \"Stonehenge would fit within just that small circle now serving as a putting green.\" He added that 2,000 years ago, Indigenous workers built these earthworks without modern tools, digging up soil with pointed sticks and hauling it in wicker baskets on their backs. One estimate, he noted, is that they moved seven million cubic feet of dirt.\u00a0\nThe achievement of the Hopewell Culture, however, is not simply in creating large, precise shapes, which they did without the vantage point of hills for an aerial view. They also embedded a sort of hidden geometry within these structures. Until the mounds were measured and compared, it was thought that the builders didn't have any mathematical and geometrical sophistication, as there are no written records to testify to their level of knowledge. It was eventually discovered, however, that they made precise measurements across their earthworks and connected them in unsuspecting ways.\u00a0\nLepper explained that the circumference of The Great Circle \"is equal to the perimeter of the perfect square that it was connected to\", and that \"the area of that perfect square is equal to the area of the [Observatory Circle] that's connected to The Octagon\".\u00a0\nHe added: \"If you draw a square inside The Octagon by drawing a line from alternate corners of The Octagon, the sides of that square [1,054ft] are equal to the diameter of the circle that it's attached to [1,054ft].\"\nExamples of this interplay between earthworks have been found repeatedly by archaeologists. According to Lepper, that measure of 1054ft, whether halved or doubled, is found in other Indigenous earthworks across the country, and served as a common unit of measure.\u00a0\nWhile the Hopewell Culture's geometrical and mathematical knowledge astonished scholars, another level of sophistication appears when the layers are peeled back further: astronomical alignment.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The US's lost, ancient megacity\n\u2022 A mysterious US desert civilisation\n\u2022 A long-lost Maya city that was just discovered\nIn the 1980s, two professors at Earlham College in Indiana, Ray Hively (a physicist and astronomer) and Robert Horn (a philosopher), decided to pay a visit to The Octagon and its attached Observatory Circle. As astronomical monuments like Stonehenge had received great attention, they wondered if these earthworks were also aligned to a solar calendar.\u00a0\u00a0\nHively and Horn found no solar connections, but they then considered an alternative purpose: the lunar cycle.\n\"We thought deliberate lunar alignments unlikely at Newark,\" they wrote, because while the Sun can be tracked over a year, a complete lunar cycle takes 18.6 years. Even so, the lunar cycle proved to correspond to the position of the Observatory Mound at The Observatory Circle. There, one can watch the Moon rise over the exact centre of The Octagon in the distance every 18.6 years.\u00a0\n\"Astronomical alignments are only relevant and useful if they somehow tie the celestial orbs to belief systems and understandings of life,\" said Timothy Darvill, professor of archaeology at Bournemouth University who has researched both Stonehenge and the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks. \"The ceremonies around the observation of the skyscape could well have a secondary function in terms of fostering community.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThat ancient community and culture was part of the reason for its Unesco World Heritage Site inclusion.\u00a0\nA Unesco site needs to show that it has \"outstanding universal value\", said Jennifer Aultman, director of historic sites and museums at Ohio History Connection which helped lead its Unesco consideration. One criterion for this, she said, \"is that these are masterpieces of human creative genius\", which is where these mathematical, geometrical and astronomical features are important. The other, \"is that they bear really exceptional testimony to the cultural tradition that produced them\".\nAultman explained: \"You really can understand something about the lives of the people and what mattered to them by looking at, and learning about, the earthworks.\"\u00a0\nConsider the Moon, for example, which was clearly important for the Hopewell Culture. Darvill told me that, for some cultures, the \"Sun, Moon... are considered to have power over what happens on a day-to-day basis. As such, the heavenly bodies are often deified, which is how their power is justified and rationalised.\" It is therefore likely that the Moon was a deity shared by those who gathered at the mounds.\u00a0\n\"The land we know as Ohio is home to a number of extraordinary earthworks built by Indigenous residents of this region thousands of years ago,\" said Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of the Ohio History Connection. While not all earthworks in Ohio are specifically Hopewell Mounds \u2013 such as the solar-aligned Serpent Mound Historical Site in Peebles, Ohio, for example \u2013 Wood sees them all as \"icons\" of Indigenous \"cultural achievements\".\u00a0\nSince the Hopewell Culture left no written records, only the earthworks and the few objects retrieved from them serve as their last cultural testimony. While archaeological excavations continue on some sites, objects like ritual smoking pipes and a small stone statue of a shaman wearing a bear skin and holding a human skull called \"the Shaman of Newark\" have been found. As these earthworks were gathering places and not villages, artefacts representing the locations from where these Indigenous peoples travelled have also been discovered, like effigy pipes, a copper head plate and an obsidian knife.\nHowever, after the Hopewell Culture gradually began to disappear starting around 500 CE, other Indigenous peoples stepped in to become caretakers of the land. One of those groups was the Shawnee Tribe, which called Ohio home before they were forcibly removed west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s.\u00a0\n\"We may not have been responsible for building or creating them, but I know that my ancestors lived there, and that my ancestors protected them and respected them,\" said Chief Glenna Wallace of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, who believes that other tribes should have a role in the future of protecting the Hopewell Earthworks and communicating their cultural importance.\u00a0\nFor years, The Octagon was under the control of the Moundbuilders Country Club. After more than a decade of negotiations, the OHC and the club finally reached a deal in 2024 to transfer the site's long-term lease to the historical society, paving the way for them to open the earthworks to visitors beginning this January.\nFor advocates of the site's preservation, the Unesco designation and opening of these mysterious mounds to the public offers a new chapter to educate visitors about Ohio's Native American history. It also means more Indigenous stakeholders, like the Shawnee, can tell that story from an Indigenous perspective for future generations.\u00a0\n\"I just want people to know about it,\" said Chief Wallace, \"I want people to be able to see it. I want people to be able to visit it and want people to realise that it is a cultural phenomenon. That it's priceless.\"\u00a0\nThis story was originally published in December 2022 and has been updated to reflect recent developments.\n---\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Max Verstappen won the Japanese Grand Prix for the fourth successive time as he fended off McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.\nFormula 1 now heads to Bahrain for the second race of a triple-header, from 11-13 April.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions.\nWhy do drivers rate Suzuka as their favourite circuit when pole usually wins and there is very little chance of overtaking? Sunday's race was quite boring once Max Verstappen got to the first corner before Lando Norris. - Stuart\nThe two things - the concept of a favourite circuit and one where overtaking is very difficult and the racing therefore sometimes uneventful - are not mutually exclusive.\nJust look at Monaco. The drivers love the challenge of the track, but accept the race is likely going to be processional. So too with Suzuka.\nSome drivers did remark on the lack of action. But Fernando Alonso had a more nuanced take.\nAlonso has won at both Monaco and Suzuka, and made one of his greatest - one of the greatest - overtaking moves there when he passed Michael Schumacher's Ferrari around the outside of 130R in 2005.\nAlonso said: \"This is Suzuka. I don't remember a race many times in the past where there is lots of overtaking without the weather changing.\n\"It seems every year we repeat always on Thursday how great Suzuka is, how great Monaco is, the glamour, the spectacular weekend, and then on Sunday we wake up and say: 'Ah, Monaco is boring, what can we do to the track? Suzuka is boring.'\n\"Instead of looking at the negative, I try to enjoy the experience, and it was another great Suzuka.\"\nOne thing is worth mentioning here. The resurfacing of the track in the first sector changed Suzuka this year from a circuit where tyre degradation was high, to one where it was low.\nThat changed the race from a two-stop strategy to a one. Add in the difficulty of overtaking to an event where there were no significant tyre-pace offsets developing, and the race was always likely to be processional.\nThis, though, led to a race that was driven pretty much flat out all the way by the drivers. And that - rare in the Pirelli era - they enjoy.\nSo just because it fell short as entertainment, as a challenge for the drivers, it was very real.\nMax Verstappen - sensational all weekend on his way to victory - said: \"It was a fun race. The whole race I saw two orange cars in my mirror and, especially those last 20 laps, we were pushing quite hard out there. You had to keep on fighting it, basically being on the limit.\"\nOn the limit for an hour and a half around the greatest circuit on the planet. No racing driver is ever going to find that boring.\nBahrain Grand Prix\n11-13 April - race starts at 16:00 BST on 13 April\nSakhir\nGiven the demotion to Racing Bulls for Liam Lawson, what are Jack Doohan's chances looking like at Alpine given that Franco Colapinto is a reserve driver? - Anjum\nWell, the first thing to say is just because Red Bull demoted Lawson, that does not necessarily mean Alpine will do the same to Doohan.\nOn the surface, the Australian has had a traumatic start to the season. In three races so far, he has had two massive, expensive crashes. One when he spun in the wet in Australia, and one in Friday practice in Japan. Both were his errors.\nDoohan was not the only driver to crash in the difficult wet conditions in Melbourne. Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz also did. And many more drivers spun or made mistakes.\nAnd there were some significant mitigating circumstances in Suzuka.\nDoohan's crash was caused by him entering Turn One with the DRS overtaking aid still open. So the car didn't have enough downforce to cope with the G-forces on it.\nHe had been doing the same in the simulator in preparation for the race, thinking the DRS was closing automatically. But with the small lift he had on this particular lap, it did not.\nAt the same time, given his inexperience, it perhaps would have been a good idea for the engineers to remind him of it.\nAlpine, though, had not realised he had been doing this in the simulator.\nAnother mitigating factor was Doohan was under pressure to make up time because he had missed first practice while reserve driver Ryo Hirakawa was given an outing in his car.\nWhy did Alpine not put Hirakawa in team-mate Pierre Gasly's car for first practice given Doohan's lack of experience at Suzuka? They had a difficult weekend in China and wanted to evaluate some new set-up ideas, for which they felt they needed Gasly's experience.\nDespite the two big accidents, Alpine feel Doohan has, on balance, had a positive start to the season, with some promising pace hidden by some unfortunate circumstances.\nBut he is certainly not safe yet.\nShould they decide to replace him, Alpine have two reserve drivers who could potentially step up - Colapinto and Estonian Paul Aron.\nSince signing Colapinto from Williams, following his cameo role in the final few races of last season, the theory has been the access to Latin American money the Argentine gives means Doohan is on borrowed time.\nBut that threat seems to have diminished for now, the funding perhaps more theoretical than real.\nUltimately, though, Doohan's fate rests on the whim of Alpine executive adviser Flavio Briatore. He'll decide what he decides, when he decides it.\nWas Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull debut a success, and is he an improvement on Liam Lawson? - Ed\nTsunoda set himself the target of scoring points on debut at Red Bull, and finished the race 12th, behind the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso. So, by the standards he set himself, it was not a success.\nRed Bull want Tsunoda to be scoring good points to boost their bid for the constructors' title. So by their standards, it was not a success either.\nHaving said that, it certainly showed promise.\nHe started off strongly, being close on pace to Max Verstappen in first practice, and was again looking decent in final practice.\nIn first qualifying, again he was only 0.1secs from Verstappen.\nFor second qualifying, Red Bull chose to give him one set of used tyres and one of new - not unusual for a quick driver in a quick car, but perhaps a mistake given his lack of experience with the team.\nThat meant he had only one realistic shot at getting into the top 10 shootout. And Tsunoda made an error on his only flying lap on new tyres, going into Turn One 15km/h faster than ever before, and having a moment.\nHis race was dictated by qualifying 14th, but he did overtake Lawson on lap one then pull off an undercut pass on Pierre Gasly's Alpine.\nAs for comparisons with Lawson before him, Tsunoda was a definite step up. He was faster than Lawson ever was, and looked a lot more in control and confident.\nBut he will have to do better than this in the future to have any chance of keeping a seat at Red Bull in 2026.\nHow likely is it that George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli will race for Mercedes in 2026, with both out of contract this year? \u2013 John\nThe answer to this question depends entirely upon Max Verstappen.\nIf the world champion decides to stay at Red Bull, Mercedes will keep Russell and Antonelli next year.\nIf he decides to move, Mercedes is his most likely option, in which case Toto Wolff would have to decide which driver to keep.\nOn performance right now, that would be Russell. But Antonelli is only 18, just three races into his career, and believed to have rich promise. Jettisoning him after a year would be harsh indeed.\nIn that scenario, Russell is likely to be an attractive candidate to Red Bull, too.\nWhat will Verstappen do? For now, he is relaxed and waiting to see how the season develops. He is under contract to Red Bull until the end of 2028, but has performance-related get-out clauses if he wants to leave.\nThe difficulty in making any decision about the future is no-one is absolutely certain what next year and beyond will look like in terms of engines.\nMercedes are widely believed to be ahead on development of the new 2026 power-units. But their future is uncertain.\nFIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem is pushing for an early abandonment of the 2026 engine formula and a return to naturally aspirated V10s running on sustainable fuel. Why, he has yet to explain. But for now all that matters is he is.\nThat exact route looks unlikely to happen. Ferrari and Red Bull back the V10 idea, but it is not appealing to Mercedes, Honda or Audi - and that's more than enough manufacturers to vote that idea down under F1's rule structures.\nBut that does not mean a change won't come before 2031 - the current end of the new engine regs.\nPerhaps manufacturers would agree to a different, bigger engine - a V8, for example - with a turbo and some hybrid element, but not as much as the 50% of total power planned for next year.\nThere is a meeting to discuss F1's future engine direction in Bahrain on Friday and no-one knows what the conclusion will be - or indeed if there will be one.\nVerstappen will wait a little longer to see how things stand on many fronts before making any decision on his future.\nBetween a packed calendar, other commitments and strict regulations on costs, how much time do F1 drivers actually get to practise driving their cars during a season? Is it mostly simulator based? \u2013 Arv\nIn-season testing in current cars is forbidden by F1's regulations.\nDrivers are allowed to test in cars that are more than a year old. This was unrestricted for a while, but has for 2025 been limited for current drivers to 1,000km a year.\nDrivers can also participate in Pirelli tyre development tests in the latest cars, or whatever spec of car is required, if called upon.\nOther than that, the only \"practice\" they get is in the simulator.\nWhether the best drivers in the world need any practice in a year in which there are 24 grands prix is another question.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nHow Verstappen stole Suzuka with McLaren stuck in 'rabbit hole'\nJapanese Grand Prix Review\nHow to follow Bahrain Grand Prix on the BBC",

        "article_text": "The Williams brothers bring pace and direct running to Athletic Bilbao's attack\nEuropa League quarter-final, first leg: Rangers v Athletic Bilbao\nVenue: Ibrox Stadium, Glasgow Date: Thursday, 10 April Kick-off: 20:00 BST\nCoverage: Listen on BBC Radio Scotland Extra & Sounds, plus follow live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app\nWhen Nico Williams led England a merry dance on a balmy summer's night in Berlin last July, it capped the season of his dreams. Now he is determined to do similar damage to Rangers and keep Athletic Bilbao on course for their first European trophy.\nIn the space of 100 days, Williams produced two showpiece man-of-the-match performances.\nFirst, he helped end Bilbao's four-decade wait for silverware, then he opened the scoring for Spain in the German capital as his country won their fourth European Championship title.\nFans and the game's biggest clubs across the continent gazed lovingly at this football maverick, who exploded onto the scene a few seasons ago but whose stock has risen 10-fold in the past 12 months. \nThat ascent began with his role in winning last year's Copa Del Rey, Athletic Club's first success since a league and cup double in 1984.\nBorn in Pamplona, Williams regularly acknowledges the life he has been afforded came despite his parents' struggles in Ghana before they fled for Spain.\nAfter placing his Euro 2024 winners' medal round his mother's neck, he said: \"I run fast, but not as fast as my mother. She escaped death and crossed the Sahara from Ghana to Spain. I gave her my medal because she deserves it more.\"\nIt seems that the humble Williams will have his pick when it comes to his next club, with Arsenal the latest to be heavily linked with his services.\nNot that he is in a rush to leave Bilbao. They are his club. \n\"I was the first one to cry, you can't even imagine what this feels like,\" he said after their historic Spanish Cup win against Mallorca in Seville's Cartuja. \n\"It's a dream to win with the club of my life,\" he said.\nFor the club it was monumental, coming after no fewer than seven straight cup final defeats, including in the 2012 Europa League.\nThe coronavirus pandemic meant they wrote unwanted history in 2021, losing two Copa del Rey finals in the space of two weeks to Basque rivals Real Sociedad and then Barcelona.\nThe tactical & mental reasons behind Jekyll and Hyde Rangers\nFerguson hopes 'long chat' bears fruit v Bilbao\n'Top-class Butland making too many regular mistakes'\nMaking their eventual success all the sweeter for Williams was the fact his older brother Inaki \u2013 who represents the country of his parents \u2013 was alongside him in the Bilbao team.\nWith Bilbao hosting this season's Europa League final at the impressive Estadio San Mames, the Williams brothers are doubly determined to brush Rangers aside and take a big step closer to the reality of winning the trophy on their own patch.\nAs Jose Mourinho was at pains to point out as he gazed upon the burning ashes of Fenerbahce's shoot-out defeat at Ibrox, Athletic Club are big favourites to move into a semi-final against Lyon or Manchester United.\nWith Nico and Inaki, who have both scored five Europa League goals this season, on the flanks, manager Ernesto Valverde has potency at the top of the pitch in addition to the joint-best defence in La Liga at his disposal.\n\"This title is unlike any other,\" said Valverde - in his third spell in charge of the club - when they lifted the Copa del Rey. \nHowever they could top that in six weeks' time.\nHaving overcome Roma in the last 16, the former Barcelona and Olympiacos coach is determined to build on last season's cup win with another trophy.\nChampions League football next season is also within sight with the club sitting fourth in the Spanish top flight.\nNico's Spain team-mate Oihan Sancet, their top scorer in the league this season, has made a timely return to the fold after a thigh problem. He made a cameo appearance from the bench during their goalless draw at Villareal on Sunday.\nKey defender Dani Vivian, with the Copa del Rey trophy that ended Athletic Club's drought\nThat was a second stalemate in succession, but one which prevented their closest challengers for that final La Liga Champions League spot from making up ground.\nSpain's number one Unai Simon will sit Thursday's game out as Athletic Club's number two Julen Agirrezabala plays in their European matches. \nHowever, you realise that is not a big downgrade when you see the crucial saves he made against Mallorca - including in the penalty shoot-out that decided the King's Cup's destination a year ago.\nThere are doubts over the fitness of centre-back Aitor Paredes but Valverde is hopeful he will take his usual position beside the rock-solid Dani Vivian at the heart of the Bilbao backline.\nRangers may take a degree of optimism from the fact Bilbao are not in red-hot form though.

That ascent began with his role in winning last year's Copa Del Rey, Athletic Club's first success since a league and cup double in 1984.Born in Pamplona, Williams regularly acknowledges the life he has been afforded came despite his parents' struggles in Ghana before they fled for Spain.After placing his Euro 2024 winners' medal round his mother's neck, he said: \"I run fast, but not as fast as my mother.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump is a man in a hurry. \nIn the few short months he has been in office, the US president has sought and failed to bring peace to Gaza and Ukraine. He has bombed Yemen. He has launched a global trade war. Now he is turning his attention to Iran.\nThis has always been on the president's jobs list. For Trump, Iran is unfinished business from his first term. \nThe issue remains the same as it was then: what can stop Iran seeking a nuclear weapon? \nIran denies it has any such ambition. But other countries believe the Islamic republic wants at the very least the capacity to build a nuclear warhead, a desire that some fear could spark an arms race or even all-out war in the Middle East.\nIn 2015, Iran agreed a deal with the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. It was called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). \nUnder its provisions, Iran would limit its nuclear ambitions - and allow in international inspectors - in return for getting economic sanctions lifted.\nBut Trump pulled the US out of the deal in 2018, claiming it rewarded terrorism by funding Iran's proxy militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah. The US reimposed sanctions. \nIran subsequently ignored some of the deal's restrictions and enriched more and more uranium nuclear fuel. \nAnalysts fear Iran could soon have enough weapons-grade uranium to make a nuclear warhead. \nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) watchdog estimates Iran's stockpile of 60% enriched uranium could make about six bombs if it was enriched to the next and final level.\nWithin days of his inauguration, Trump restored his former policy of so-called \"maximum pressure\" on Iran. \nOn 4 February, with his trademark fat felt-tip pen, he signed a memorandum ordering the US Treasury to impose further sanctions on Iran and punish countries violating existing sanctions, especially those buying Iranian oil.\nNow the White House is hoping to match that economic pressure with diplomacy. \nLast month, Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. \nThe president offered to begin negotiations and sought a deal within a couple of months.\nNow he has agreed to direct discussions between US and Iranian officials in Oman at the weekend.\nThe US threat to Iran is explicit: agree a deal or face military action. \n\"If the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger,\" Trump said on Monday.\nSo how might Iran respond? \nSome policymakers in Tehran appear keen to agree a deal that could get sanctions lifted. \nIran's economy is in dire straits, with soaring inflation and a plunging currency. \nBut any such deal might involve compromises some hardliners could find hard to stomach. \nIran has suffered huge reverses in recent months, seeing its proxy militias severely weakened by war with Israel and its regional ally, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, ousted. Some in Tehran argue now may be exactly the time to build a nuclear deterrent.\nBoth the US and Iran seem far apart. Their negotiating positions are not explicit. \nBut the US has made clear it wants the full dismantlement of Iran's nuclear programme, including a complete end to any further uranium enrichment, plus no further support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.\nThat might prove too much for Iran to accept. \nA complete ban on any nuclear enrichment - even for civilian purposes - has long been seen as an absolute red line for Tehran. \nThere is also the problem of Iranian technological expertise: its scientists simply know more now about how to make a nuclear weapon than they did 10 years ago.\nAs for Israel, it has made clear it would accept only the complete end to any Iranian nuclear capability. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he would agree to \"the way it was done in Libya\". \nThis is a reference to the decision by late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to dismantle his entire nuclear programme in 2003 in return for getting sanctions lifted. \nBut Iran is unlikely to follow this precedent.\nWhat if talks fail? \nIsrael has long considered military options to try to destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities. But many are buried deep in underground bunkers. \nMilitary analysts say Israel would need not just US help to bomb Iran, it might also need special forces on the ground to guarantee the destruction of its nuclear facilities. \nThis means military action would be risky and its success by no means guaranteed.\nTrump also came to office promising not to start any more so-called \"forever wars\", and an all-out regional conflict involving Iran could become one of those. \nThat has not stopped the US president from reportedly giving Israel more air defences and deploying more long-range B2 bombers to the region.\nSo, for now, Trump seems to be looking for a diplomatic solution - one Israel might have to accept as a fait accompli, regardless of its provisions. \nBut if there is no agreement, he is reserving the right to use force, the consequences of which could be devastating.\nIn the meantime, the president is allowing two months for both sides to agree a deal. \nHe may have forgotten it took negotiators two years to agree the JCPOA. Rushed diplomacy is not always successful diplomacy.",

So he delayed saying farewell to a place that means so much to him.\n\"They're the two most important wins in my career,\" he said of his 1985 and 1993 victories at Augusta, which are his sole major triumphs.\n\"It's emotional. You can tell already my voice is breaking a bit just realising it's going to be my last competitive Masters.\"\nLanger has conceded for many years that he no longer has the game to compete at Augusta; three missed cuts in his past three Masters are testament to that.\n\"The course is just getting too long and I'm getting shorter and shorter,\" he said. \n\"I'm hitting hybrids [into greens] where the other kids are hitting nine-irons, maybe even wedges. So I knew I wasn't going to be in contention anymore.\n\"A few years back I asked the chairman of the club, 'is there a time limit? Do we age out when we're 60?'. He said, 'no, you will know when it's time to quit, it's totally up to you'.\n\"It is time to quit.\"\nLyle, Langer, Woosnam, Olazabal, Ballesteros and Faldo were victorious at Augusta National in an extraordinary era of success for European golf\nLanger was runner-up at The Open twice and third on three occasions in a career that promised more major success.\nThat he was unable to add a major other than his two at Augusta only intensifies his link to this fabled corner of Georgia.\nIn 40 appearances, he has made the cut 27 times and finished inside the top 10 nine times.\n\"It's been an incredible journey, for a young man born in a village of 800 people [in Bavaria, southern Germany], where golf was nothing, to make it here,\" he said.\n\"To get an invitation to play the Masters when it was extremely difficult for European or international players to get one, and then to win the Masters on the third go was just a dream come true.\"\nHe was just the third non-American winner, following in the footsteps of South Africa's three-time champion Gary Player and Seve Ballesteros of Spain, who won twice. \nHis win cemented belief among Europeans that success could be achieved at Augusta.\nBallesteros paved the way with his victories in 1980 and 1983, before Langer won his first two years later. \nThen Scotland's Sandy Lyle, England's Nick Faldo (twice) Wales' Ian Woosnam, Langer again and Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal collected six of seven titles from 1988.\nLanger's debut was in 1982, two years after Ballesteros had broken the glass ceiling. \nThe German's initial experience was hardly noteworthy. He shot 77 and 78 to miss the halfway cut by one stroke after three-putting 11 times in 36 holes on unfamiliar greens that were too slick for a naive 24-year-old.\n\"Coming here the first time, driving down Magnolia Lane, seeing this place for the first time was an eye-opener,\" he said. \n\"I had never seen a golf course manicured like this or a tournament run as efficiently as this has been.\"\nBy the time Langer won his second title in 1993, he was married with three children\nHe vowed to come back better prepared and when he returned two years later he made it through to the weekend - the first of an incredible run of 19 successive Masters that Langer would play all four rounds.\nHis victory 12 months later was secured with a classic back-nine Augusta charge. He birdied four out of six holes from the 12th as he overturned a three-shot deficit to Curtis Strange, who dropped shots on three of his final five holes.\nLanger bogeyed the 18th but still beat Strange, Ray Floyd and his playing partner Ballesteros by two shots.\nHe made a solid defence of his title in 1986 and briefly shared the lead in the final round before Jack Nicklaus produced a back nine for the ages to clinch his record-extending sixth Green Jacket and 18th major title.\nThat week was also memorable for witnessing the first time a world ranking was published, and it was Langer who had the honour of topping the inaugural list.\nHe was becoming something of an Augusta specialist and the love affair strengthened with two more top 10s before he claimed his second victory in 1993.\nLanger was challenged by unheralded American Dan Forsman in the final round. \nForsman was one shot behind the German when he teed off on the notoriously tricky par-three 12th. He dumped two balls in the water, walked off with a quadruple-bogey seven and was barely heard of again.\nIn contrast, Langer's name continued to pepper the leaderboards at Augusta, with top 10s in 1997, 2001 and 2004. \nHe finished joint eighth at the age of 56 in 2014 and held the record for the oldest player to make the cut - at the age of 63 in 2020 - until Fred Couples eclipsed that in 2023.\nThis is Langer's final Masters but not the end of competitive golf for the former Ryder Cup captain, who looks as fit as he did in his pomp.\nHe shows no signs of slowing down on the PGA Tour Champions - the US-based seniors tour - and has racked up at least one victory a year since joining the circuit in 2007 when he turned 50. \nHe has won 12 majors among 47 senior victories - both of which are records.\nThis week he is back among the game's youthful elite though, and will seek to end his Masters career with the same controlled elegance with which he has played throughout his career.\nHe will not contend for the title. That is clear. Instead, the question is whether his Masters career ends after round two on Friday, or if he defies his own expectations and makes the cut.\n\"After four decades it's going to be bittersweet,\" he said.\n\"When I'm inside the ropes, my mind switches to being a competitor, play golf and take care of the task in front of me. \n\"But I might get a bit emotional looking around, seeing my family, my kids, my grandkids, my brother and other friends that are going to be supporting me this week.\n\"I love the Masters more than any tournament in the world. I'm expecting it to be very difficult emotionally.\"",

        "article_text": "It's only been a couple of years since the last series of Charlie Brooker's dystopian Netflix show Black Mirror landed. But we're now living in an unpredictable world and a lot can happen in a short space of time.\nRenowned for its often savvy and disturbing takes on humanity and our relationship with technology, Black Mirror is back for a seventh series at a time when the pace of change in both politics and tech has left many of us - including lawmakers - struggling to keep up.\nIn 2011, when the first episode aired, Siri was the new kid on the block and the iPhone 4S had just been launched. Now we have Meta AI embedded in WhatsApp and we're on series 10 of the Apple watch. \nSince then, Black Mirror has taken us from creepy memory devices, phone implants and robotic bees to actors-turned-werewolves. And everything in between.\nBrooker is in buoyant mood as, he tells the BBC there appears to be little danger of him running out of ideas anytime soon, when asked if Black Mirror could go on forever.\n\"Hopefully [it will run and run]. Selfishly, it's a fun job,\" he says. \"Technology is developing in the real world very quickly. \n\"That means there are more sources of inspiration, and... the viewer is experiencing more [technological] things in their everyday life.\n\"We can do stories that I wouldn't have thought of 10 years ago, and also, you don't need to explain some of the concepts to people because they've got it in their phone.\"\nThe Crown and Deadpool & Wolverine actor Emma Corrin, who stars in one of this season's episodes, adds: \"It's much closer to home. People have access to stuff like AI which is terrifying so then it's more confronting and serves as a better warning.\"\nBrooker jokes: \"So you're saying it should go on forever?\" \n\"Yes, it should go on forever,\" Corrin concurs.\nBrooker adds: \"I'll find out when it stops if I drop dead or people stop watching.\"\nCorrin appears in an episode titled Hotel Reverie, alongside Issa Rae. The pair both play A-listers appearing in a remake of a vintage Hollywood classic. With a twist, of course.\nCorrin plays screen siren Dorothy Chambers, and reflects: \"I really enjoyed playing in a 1940s movie star.\n\"I just like the voice and the mannerisms and the way they hold themselves, and the style of acting is so ridiculous, larger than life and tongue in cheek, and yet packed with emotion at the same time.\"\nWithout giving too much away, AI - the subject of much debate in the creative industries - rears its head in the storyline.\nCorrin says they don't \"feel great\" about its potential impact on their profession.\n\"Obviously, I think it's scary, but it's also a massive conversation, right? There are aspects of it that are terrifying to me as an artist. I love the creative process. I love that this art is born out of being in a room with people and things coming from the depths of someone's human experience or imagination. And I really don't think we'll lose that, or I hope not. \n\"And I think there are also aspects of AI I probably don't understand, and that could be used as tools for good. It's about everyone being able to understand them and to use them correctly, and them being in the right hands.\"\nBrooker agrees: \"Quite rightly, when Andy Serkis played Gollum [in the Lord of the Rings trilogy], everyone's amazed by that, but what you're amazed by is the human, you're seeing a human performance shining through.\n\"I can totally see the value of AI as a tool for creative people. The point at which it worries me is if you remove the people bit from that equation, or you're just hoovering up their work and regurgitating it, and they're not being paid.\"\nBrooker also returns to another favourite tech theme, which he's used as a jumping off point for several Black Mirror episodes over the previous six series. The world of gaming.\nRemember the interactive standalone Black Mirror film Bandersnatch, where Asim Chaudhry and Will Poulter played a games company boss and a genius developer? The pair are now reprising their roles from the 2018 movie in a new series seven episode called Plaything.\nScottish actor Lewis Gribben, who is soon to star in the highly anticipated TV series Blade Runner 2099, plays 1990s games journalist and loner Cameron, who becomes obsessed with one particular game featuring little pixel creatures. (Brooker himself was a games journalist back in the day). \nFormer Doctor Who Peter Capaldi also turns in a brilliantly disturbing performance as an older Cameron.\nAlthough a big Black Mirror fan, Gribben hadn't seen Bandersnatch but says that coming to Plaything fresh actually aided his performance.\n\"I think it made it easier for me... but I was just intimidated. I was like 'Oh my god, it's Will Poulter who I've watched since I was seven years old acting in Son of Rambow. And Asim Chowdhury from People Just Do Nothing!\"\nGribben tells the BBC he's a bit of a gamer himself but has more of a handle on it than his Black Mirror character. \n\"I'm playing the new Assassin's Creed Shadows at the minute,\" he says. \"When you have a day off... I can spend a solid 10 hours [on it]. But I like to think most people game in moderation or just have bingeing game sessions. It's more like a relaxation thing.\"\nJosh Finan, who has starred in Baby Reindeer, The Responder and recently played Gerry Adams in Say Nothing, plays an acquaintance of Cameron who becomes unwittingly embroiled in his companion's distorted sense of reality. \nThe pair will both star in the highly anticipated Amazon mini-series, Blade Runner 2099. Expected to drop later this year, the action takes place 50 years after 2017's Blade Runner 2049, a movie that also analyses the relationship between humans and AI.\nFinan isn't too worried about being replaced by robots though.\n\"I'm very optimistic. I don't think actors are going anywhere. Maybe I'm being naive [but] I don't think there's any danger of being replaced. What we do is too special.\"\nBlack Mirror series seven can be seen on Netflix from Thursday 10 April.",

That is the worrying thing. This is a difficult night, especially in the run of form we're in. \n\"It's important to analyse this, sleep on it and recover from it. That's it for now.

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg.

        "article_text": "Fifty years after Monty Python and the Holy Grail redefined comedy, stars Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam look back on the freedoms \u2013 and limitations \u2013 that shaped the film.\nAn independent British comedy made on a shoestring by a television sketch troupe? It sounds like a film destined to be forgotten within weeks of leaving cinemas \u2013 assuming it reaches cinemas in the first place. But Monty Python and the Holy Grail is still revered as one of the greatest ever big-screen comedies, 50 years on from its release in April 1975. Terry Gilliam, who co-directed the film with Terry Jones, thinks he knows why. \"Every time I watch it I'm completely bowled over by how incredibly wonderful it is,\" Gilliam tells the BBC. \"It's still so funny, and I just love everything about it.\"\nThe Monty Python team first appeared on TV together in a BBC series, Monty Python's Flying Circus, in 1969. Five of the six members \u2013 Terry Jones, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin \u2013 had honed their craft in student comedy societies at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The sixth, Gilliam, had moved to the UK from the US, and provided animated segments which linked their surreal sketches. In 1971, some of these sketches were reshot and compiled into a film, And Now for Something Completely Different, but the Pythons had ambitions to make a bona fide feature film \u2013 or some of them did, at least.\n\"It was by no means unanimous that we should do a film after the television series,\" says Palin. \"John, to his credit, was doing Fawlty Towers, Eric was doing Rutland Weekend Television, but the two Terrys wanted to direct a film, and I loved cinema as well, so that was the only way forward \u2013 not to make it three Python shows tacked one after the other, but to make it a full cinematic experience. No other television series had, as far as I know, leapt into cinema, but we thought we'd have a go.\"\nChapman and Jones have both died (or ceased to be, to borrow a line from one of their most beloved sketches), and Cleese and Idle were unavailable to talk to the BBC, but Gilliam and Palin reminisce cheerfully about Holy Grail \u2013 Palin quietly affable, Gilliam cackling with enthusiasm.\nPalin mentions that he and Jones had made a pre-Python series of historical sketches, The Complete and Utter History of Britain, and Jones would go on to be an acclaimed medieval historian. However, that wasn't why the team chose to build their first proper feature film around King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.\n\"We had to do something that used all six of us,\" says Palin, \"and of course the Round Table was the perfect template for that because we could each play one of the knights. And also because the Holy Grail legend was something that everyone had heard of, but nobody really knew anything about it. You could create any sort of story based around the search for a Grail.\"\nMichael Palin's Five Culture Shifters\nThe Goon Show (1951 to 1960)\nThe Goon Shows had a profound effect on me, and I know they did on John Cleese and Terry Jones. For me, they represented a moving-on from my parents' preferences for television and radio. It was just the profusion of ideas \u2013 half an hour full of strange images, weird noises, amazing sound.\nHeartbreak Hotel by Elvis Presley (1956)\nThat was a culture shifter for me, because unlike most of the pop songs I was listening to at that time, it made me think that this was something for my generation, and not the generation before.\nLady Chatterley's Lover by DH Lawrence (1928, published in 1960)\nThese are rather personal choices reflecting on my relationship with my parents. When they got a copy of Lady Chatterley's Lover, it made me feel better towards them. It was a great breakthrough for me to know that they were as interested in sex as I was!\nThe Rocky Horror Show by Richard O'Brien (1973)\nJohn Cleese invited me along to see the live show in a small theatre in the King's Road. I was quite gobsmacked by this funny and outrageous celebration of the gay world \u2013 and there wasn't much of it around at that time. I remember thinking, wow, I've grown up a bit, having seen this.\nThe London Olympics opening ceremony by Danny Boyle (2012)\nIt wasn't saying \"good old Britain\" or \"imperial Britain\" or anything like that. It was about our way of life in Britain today \u2013 and done in such a creative, inventive way. To have a whole sequence about the National Health Service, instead of fireworks and pompous costumes and flags and endless marching \u2013 here was something celebratory in a way I'd never expected.\nNot that Monty Python and the Holy Grail was ever going to be a straightforward Arthurian adventure. Just as mind-bogglingly absurdist as the sketches that made the group's name, the film boasted faux-Swedish subtitles, Gilliam's instantly recognisable animation, a Trojan Rabbit, the Knights Who Say \"Ni!\", a debate about whether swallows are strong enough to carry coconuts and a modern-day historian who pops up to comment on the action before being brutally slain by a passing knight. It was, in other words, a unique proposition, which could be why the BBC chose not to invest in it. With the help of theatrical impresario Michael White, the Pythons ended up securing funds from some unusual sources, including\u00a0Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and various record companies.\nPalin: \"I say to people, 'Led Zeppelin gave us \u00a350,000 \u2013 and look where they are now.'\"\nGilliam: \"Thank God for rock'n'roll is all I can say.\"\nThe upside to this unconventional set of backers, Gilliam adds, was that the team had complete creative freedom. \"Looking back, it always seemed to me very pure, what we were doing. We were just trying to make ourselves laugh, at the same time as saying interesting things, serious things. There were no outside forces. We, the six of us, made the decisions, end of conversation, and that's a rare thing. Musicians get away with that all the time. Not many film-makers do.\"\nThe downside was that even with the Pythons' celebrity fans chipping in \"a little bit of money\", in Palin's words, the film's budget was less than \u00a3300,000 ($393,000). This wasn't much for a sweeping fantasy set in medieval Britain, so the team had to be inventive.\nThey couldn't afford to have knights riding on horseback, for instance, so King Arthur (Chapman) and his men trot along on foot, with servants behind them tapping halved coconut shells together to make the clip-clop noise of horses' hooves. Another bit of crafty problem-solving came when the team's permission to shoot at several Scottish castles was rescinded at the last minute. Instead, they simply shot Doune Castle near Stirling, Scotland from numerous different angles so that it appeared to be a different castle each time.\n\"What I love is that Doune Castle has reaped the benefit,\" says Palin. \"It's now the centre of a sort of Python tourist industry, and it's the only castle gift shop to sell ready-cut coconut shells.\"\nDespite its limited budget, one key reason why the film has lasted is that it looks like an authentic period epic, complete with atmospheric footage shot on location in Scotland. \"We were frustrated by the television shows because they had rather bad sets and bad lighting and bad everything,\" says Gilliam of himself and Jones, \"and both of us were big fans of Bruegel as a painter and Pasolini as a film-maker. We wanted all of those textures, all of that reality. I think that's what is totally unique about the film: some of the film-makers were serious historians and real film directors.\"\nNot all of the Pythons saw the necessity of those Bruegel-and-Pasolini-like textures, though. \"One of the joys of the film was looking for locations, places that had history, and trying to make them beautiful,\" says Gilliam. \"But there were days when I got in fights with the rest of the team, who had no interest in creating the times and making it real.\"\nSome members of the group were \"constantly moaning\" about shooting outdoors, especially when the Scottish rain waterlogged their heavy woollen tunics, Gilliam says. \"Mike was fine, Terry was fine, but the others just hated wearing uncomfortable costumes. They just wanted to be funny. But I said, 'You're missing the point. To be funny you've got to be real first. All this has got to be genuine.' I just thought the humour would be much, much funnier if we could ground it in reality.\"\nUltimately, the two Terrys got their way, and, as Gilliam and Palin agree, Chapman's commitment to the reality of a proud but peeved King Arthur contrasted perfectly with the silliness around him. \"Everything about him was totally believable,\" says Gilliam.\nThe only trouble with this naturalistic approach to the Middle Ages was that it came to be associated in viewers\u2019 minds with Monty Python, Gilliam says. That meant that any other films with a similar aesthetic \u2013 mud, smoke, grey weather, crumbling castles \u2013 could seem Pythonesque, however earnest they were attempting to be. Robert Bresson's Lancelot du Lac was released in the UK in August 1975, remembers Gilliam. \"It was deadly serious. And people started laughing because it was such a serious attempt to do the real thing, and it wasn't as good as what we were doing.\"\nHoly Grail had profound effects on the Pythons themselves, too. The success of the film convinced Gilliam that he wasn't just an animator, but a director, \"because the credits said that\", and it boosted the team's international profile, \"expanding our control over humanity\".\nIt also prompted Monty Python to make a follow-up. \"There was a feeling even after we'd done The Holy Grail of 'OK, we've done this film, bit of an experiment, but even if it works, we've all got other things to do,'\" says Palin. \"But as we did the publicity around the world, we spent a lot of time in airports, and the idea that became The Life of Brian was born in one of these bored discussions while waiting for a flight to Dublin or somewhere. Eric came up with the title, Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory, and that steered us towards the Bible story, and it meant that we were all prepared to give time to writing another film \u2013 and that was very much on the borderline. It might just have been one film, and that was that.\"\nTerry Gilliam's Five Culture Shifters\nRosa Parks' protest (1955)\nWhat a lady. What's so interesting is that the right person in the right place does something, and suddenly normal people who don't normally pay attention to things say, \"Why is this woman not able to sit on the bus like a human being?\" These powerful images hopefully wake people up.\nHeartbreak Hotel by Elvis Presley (1956) and I Want to Hold Your Hand by The Beatles (1963)\nThe first time I heard I Want to Hold Your Hand was a huge shift. I was sitting in my car in a parking lot in university, and the sound just got to me. Before that it was Elvis, Heartbreak Hotel. In both cases, I was on my own, I turned on my radio, and the world changed. This was something new and special.\nThe Pill (1960)\nI was around when the pill popped up \u2013 and suddenly sex was rampant, ladies and gentlemen! But it was also wonderful how, as sex increased, love seemed to increase, too, and so we had the Summer of Love.\nContemporary politics (2025)\nI think we're now going through the biggest cultural shift I've experienced in my whole life. It has gotten very weird to see how quickly all these extreme right-wingers are blossoming.\nNot only did Holy Grail lead to two further films, Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979) and Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (1983), it was adapted by Idle and John Du Prez into a long-running Broadway show, Spamalot, which won the Tony award for best musical in 2003. Both Palin and Gilliam sing the show's praises, Gilliam's one reservation being that \"it wasn't muddy enough\".\nEven more remarkably, many of the film's phrases have entered the British lexicon, and some of its characters have become archetypes: failing politicians are regularly compared to the Black Knight, who is determined to keep fighting even when his limbs have been lopped off, while Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot is brought up when someone is seen to be especially cowardly.\nThese characters are so resonant, Gilliam suggests, because even at its most ludicrous, Monty Python's humour is \"about real people with real attitudes\", adding: \"and Britain is becoming more and more like the characters in The Holy Grail!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Clueless revolutionised the high school comedy\n\u2022 Richard Linklater on his masterpiece, Boyhood\n\u2022 The 60s icon who changed style forever\nThe characters who are cited to Palin most often, he says, are the Knights Who Say \"Ni!\". \"Apparently Elvis Presley liked watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail near to the end of his life. I don't know if he was taking it in, but just the idea of Elvis Presley saying 'Ni' gives me happiness during dark times.\"\nThe film has, arguably, offered happiness to many others who watched it during dark times, too. The Pythons weren't on a quest for the secret of immortal comedy, but somehow they stumbled on that Grail. \"I just think Python was the perfect chemical balance, the six of us,\" says Gilliam. \"We're all very different, and to put those six people in the same room, and they all basically agree on what they're doing, it's an extraordinary thing. Without any one of us, it was not the same. When Graham died [in 1989], it was already changing. And with Terry [Jones] gone [in 2020]\u2026 people say, 'Wouldn't it be great for Python to get together again?' It would be pointless to get together again! It wouldn't work. It was a magical chemical balance. It was spectacular.\"\nCulture Shifters is an interview series in which high-profile creatives reflect on a work of theirs which made a big impact on the world.

        "article_text": "For the first time in decades, Lyle and Erik Menendez say they are beginning to feel hope they could get parole. It is a shift in mindset for the brothers, who have spent more than 30 years behind bars for the murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home.\n\"My brother and I are cautiously hopeful,\" Lyle Menendez, 57, said in a recent jailhouse interview with TMZ, which was aired on Fox.\n\"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he added.\nThe Menendez brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.\nThe case shocked the nation - not only for the brutal nature of the crime, but also for the courtroom drama that followed.\nTheir first trial ended in a hung jury after both brothers detailed years of sexual abuse they claimed to have suffered at the hands of their father, a high-powered music industry executive.\nBut prosecutors in the second trial cast doubt on those claims, arguing the brothers had acted out of greed and wanted to inherit their parents' wealth. The jury agreed, and the brothers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nOver the decades, the brothers have kept up their appeals - and recently learned that they would get a parole hearing after all.\nWith that hearing scheduled for June, and a resentencing hearing in the middle of April, the brothers are reflecting on how they will lead their lives if freed.\n\"What it is that I want to do in terms of my day-to-day life is much of what I'm doing in here. I want to be an advocate for people that are suffering in silence,\" 54-year-old Erik Menendez told TMZ.\n\"Lyle and I aren't talking about leaving prison - should we be able to get out - and not looking back. Our lives will be spent working with the prison and doing the work that we're doing in here, out there,\" he added.\nPart of the bid for parole hinges on a risk assessment that evaluates whether the brothers are still seen as threats to society.\nThe brothers say they have changed in prison.\n\"I'm striving to be a better person every day, and I want to be a person that my family can be proud of,\" said Erik Menendez. \"Who I've evolved into, who I've seen Lyle evolve into. I'm beginning to like myself, be proud of myself, and find it's okay to like myself.\"\nDuring their time in prison, both Erik and Lyle have started rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates and taught classes on trauma healing and meditation.\n\"Our best moments are the ones that are not spoken about, and we just help somebody, or we help an animal, or we make somebody smile that's feeling down that might have gone and harmed themselves if we weren't there,\" Erik said, speaking of their volunteer work in prison.\nDespite the upcoming parole hearing, the brothers' future - and the other possible paths to freedom - remain uncertain.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman recently withdrew a motion for resentencing that had been filed under his predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, signalling a harder stance on the case.\nHochman has publicly said he will not support the brothers' release, though the final decision rests with a judge.\nThe move has stirred controversy with the DA's office as two former prosecutors who worked under Gasc\u00f3n and advocated for the brothers' resentencing, have filed a legal case against Hochman - accusing him of harassment, retaliation, and defamation. \nThe pair claim they were demoted because of their stance on the case - and have faced intense public scrutiny as a result. Mr Hochman's office is yet to comment.\nSome members of the Menendez family have also criticized Mr Hochman, suggesting he is letting personal bias influence his actions. Mr Hochman denies this.\n\"Hochman doesn't seem to want to listen or engage with us,\" the brothers' cousin Tamara Goodell told US media. Ms Goodell accused the prosecutor of dismissing and ignoring the family, and \"not acting like a neutral party\".\nBut public opinion remains divided.\nIn the same TMZ special, Alan Abrahamson, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the Menendez trials in the 1990s, said the brothers are \"two of the most skilled and accomplished liars\".\n\"The Menendezes are very capable of shapeshifting, and being who people who want them to be,\" Mr Abrahamson said. \"And I think this is one of the grave dangers of this discussion that people don't seem to pick up on.\"\nThat is a thought shared by a former Beverly Hills detective who was assigned to investigate the murders at the time.\n\"This is the most heinous murder case I've had,\" Tom Linehan told TMZ. He believes the Menendez brothers were money-motivated killers who grew up getting exactly they wanted.\n\"If somebody is challenging what they want to do, they'd take them out if they had to,\" Linehan added.\nAs for the brothers, they have to hope the parole board sees things differently, so they will continue to fight their legal case.\n\"You never know how long you'll be blessed to be on the Earth, so we don't sit around waiting for something,\" Lyle said.",

More than $5 trillion (\u00a33.9tn) was erased from the S&P 500.\nIn early trading on Monday, the S&P 500's decline briefly extended to more than 20% since a peak in February, putting it into bear market territory.  \nEconomists speculated that many countries would attempt to negotiate deals with the US on the tariffs.\nBut Trump doubled down, telling reporters on Sunday night that \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\". \nIf world leaders are unable to agree terms with Trump, the tariffs may have a destructive effect on economies globally, analysts have warned.\n\"Fundamentally, investors are worried about a big hit to corporate [profits] and a massive slowdown in economic growth,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \nOn Monday, Goldman Sachs, the US investment banking giant, raised the likelihood of a recession in the US from 35% to 45%.\nLast week, after China retaliated against the US with its own tariffs, JP Morgan forecast there was a 60% chance the world's largest economy will enter a downturn.  \nIn a letter to shareholders on Monday, JP Morgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon, said that the tariffs \"will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession\".\nHe wrote: \"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.\" \nIn the UK, that could mean a 0.8% fall in economic growth this year, economists at KPMG forecast. \n\"There is a strong incentive to seek a negotiated settlement that diminishes the need for tariffs,\" said Yael Selfin, KPMG's chief economist.\nChina's decision to impose retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the US escalated worries about a trade war between the two nations, continued to weigh on the price of oil which fell more than 4%.\nTrump hit back at China's tariffs on his social media, criticising Beijing for \"not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate\".\n\"They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA!\" he added.\nMeanwhile, copper, an indicator of economic growth because it is widely used in industry, closed more than 7% lower on Friday.\nThe price of gold, which is usually seen as a \"safe\" investment, also dropped slightly.

        "article_text": "Maitland-Niles has become one of the leaders at Lyon but Cherki (left) is the young spark in the attack under manager Paulo Fonseca\nAinsley Maitland-Niles can count stars such as Bukayo Saka, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Phil Foden among his former team-mates but it is young Lyon sensation Rayan Cherki the ex-Arsenal man describes as the \"best natural talent\"  he has ever seen.\nMaitland-Niles and Cherki are part of a resurgent Lyon outfit who face Manchester United in the quarter-final of the Europa League at the Groupama Stadium on Thursday (20:00 BST).\nAs well as Maitland-Niles, Lyon have ex-Premier League players in former Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette and ex-United midfielder Nemanja Matic, plus World Cup winners in France international Corentin Tolisso and Argentina defender Nicolas Tagliafico. \nBut Cherki, 21, is the player that catches the eye and, according to Maitland-Niles, will be a major threat on Thursday night.\n\"He is the best natural talent I've ever seen,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"An absolute master, a wizard with the ball.\"\nCherki has nine goals and 18 assists in 36 games this season across all competitions but individual moments, like his two mazy dribbles to set up Malick Fofana goals against Rangers or his wonderful vision to pick out striker Georges Mikautadze against PSG have made the headlines. \n\"He is taking chances, assists and dragging us up the pitch by taking people on and nutmegging them - he is a genius,\" adds Maitland-Niles.\nOnly three players from Europe's top five leagues - Bruno Fernandes (129), Raphinha (122) and Joshua Kimmich (113) - have created more than Cherki's 103 chances in all competitions this season. And he ranks second in Ligue 1 for completed dribbles with 74, behind Paris St-Germain's Desire Doue with 79.\nThere are also training videos of Cherki with France Under-21s, where he displays equal ability to control and volley a ball with both feet. \n\"He is two-footed, has no fear, keeps going and going, can get past people with such ease, such finesse,\" says Maitland-Niles.\n\"He is now working for the team off the ball and has gone to another level this season.\"\nIn an in-depth interview with BBC Sport, Maitland-Niles also talks about why Arsenal are too reliant on Saka, success under Jose Mourinho at Roma, moving to France and why Lyon will show Manchester United \"respect\". \nMaitland-Niles has been a near ever-present for Lyon and played 34 matches in all competitions this season\nAfter becoming the second youngest Arsenal player to appear in the Champions League, Maitland-Niles thought he would be at his boyhood club his entire life. \nThe defender had been in the Arsenal academy since the age of six and grew up supporting the club but opted to leave on a free transfer to Lyon in 2023. \n\"Life has obviously taken a different turn,\" he says. \"I thought I'd have been in the Premier League my whole career and things obviously didn't go to plan with Arsenal.\n\"But I'm thankful to the club and they didn't put any blockages when it came to leaving. I left as, like most footballers, I wanted to play.\"\nBut why not join another Premier League club? \nHe says: \"I told my agent not to tell me which clubs were interested but just the ones with firm offers. \n\"Lyon were the first to come in and it was such a big club showing their trust and belief in me. It was hard to turn down and it was a good time to try something different. I was at a point where I needed to be shown a lot of love and thought it was a good fit for me. \n\"Of course, I am happy with where I am at this point in time. But who is to say what might come up? In the meantime, I am very happy here and enjoying every moment.\n\"I am still that same player as I was at Arsenal but now with a stronger mindset and more consistency and I know what it takes to succeed.\"\nMaitland-Niles won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2020\nA debut under legendary manager Arsene Wenger, a Europa League final start under Unai Emery in 2019, winning the FA Cup with Mikel Arteta in 2020 and winning five England caps all rank among the major landmarks in Maitland-Niles' journey.\n\"I'm still an Arsenal fan, I watch most of our games and I lived a boyhood dream by winning an FA Cup final at Wembley for the club. [That] was the pinnacle. I supported Arsenal since I was six. I wish them well,\" he adds. \nBut the FA Cup under Arteta, who he regards as a \"tactical genius in Pep Guardiola's mould\", is the last trophy Arsenal have won. \n\"[Arteta] really studied how Pep took football to new heights as one of the best managers in the world,\" he says. \"He really studied how to break down teams and be most effective in games.\n\"Arsenal are showing that at this point, not coming close enough to win the league but you can see they are making big improvements by going close two years in a row.\"\nOn his relationship with Arteta, the defender adds: \"I wouldn't say there was anything special there. I had respect for him as a manager, I thought he was a tactical genius but it was an average player-manager relationship, not especially close.\"\nMaitland-Niles also admits it is \"frustrating\" the club has not followed up that FA Cup success but gives his backing to Arteta, while adding star attacker Saka needs support.\n\"I think they now rely on him a bit too much and you can't expect so much from such a young player,\" he says.\n\"He hasn't even hit his prime yet. But I think he is the driving force of the team and they miss a bit of attacking threat when he is not playing.\n\"Bukayo has become one of the world's best wingers, very consistent, knows how to kill off a game and he can pick his moment in a genius way.\"\nAttacker Ethan Nwaneri, 18, is having his breakthrough this season and could be one option to help Saka.\n\"Physically, he is absolutely incredible and there is no fear in the kid,\" continues Maitland-Niles.  \n\"He is just going at people and trying to make things happen. You can see he is trying to become a leader very early in that team. He is trying to cement his place which is difficult as he plays in the same positions as [Martin] Odegaard and Saka. \n\"But he has got the ability to do so as well. He has the world at his feet and he just needs to take his chance.\"\nAnother landmark for Maitland-Niles was winning the Conference League under Mourinho during a successful six-month loan stint at Roma.\n\"He is a really funny guy,\" says Maitland-Niles. \"The stories Jose gave us about his previous dressing rooms and how he has won cup finals and loads of different leagues - that is an experience you can take something from.\n\"There are a lot of players that would say they love him or hate him. But he is a great guy and what you see is what you get.\"\nMaitland-Niles achieved European success in the Conference League for Jose Mourinho's Roma in 2022\nMaitland-Niles, who is becoming one of the leaders at Lyon, has warned Thursday's Europa League opponents Manchester United that \"people don't realise how big Lyon are\".\n\"We are a historically big club,\" he adds. \"Considering where we were last season, it has been a great year but we need to be addicted to winning, push for more and aim for the Champions League.\"\nMaitland-Niles also says Lyon will try to show Ruben Amorim's United side \"respect but just not too much respect\".\nHe adds: \"They are not having the greatest season but have players like Bruno (Fernandes) and (Christian) Eriksen can run over you if you show too much respect. \n\"We have a great team, great manager and team spirit. We will not be scared, we'll give it our all and believe we can win.\"\nOf course, returning to England for the second leg will also prove exciting.\nHe says: \"As an Englishman, it will be nice to go home. Old Trafford is nothing short of what they call it, the Theatre of Dreams - it can be a dream for you but it can crush your dreams, too.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "In his first few weeks back in the Oval Office, US President Donald Trump made several extraordinary decisions on foreign policy.\nHe threatened to annex Greenland, announced plans to \"take over\" Gaza, and started to remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Paris climate agreement. He has also shuttered the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the government's main overseas aid agency.\nMany of these moves are not very popular with ordinary Americans, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Centre. It surveyed 3,605 US adults in late March - just before Trump imposed sweeping trade tariffs on countries around the world.\nHere are four takeaways from the Pew research.\nTrump has increased his rhetoric on \"getting\" Greenland, and Vice-President JD Vance recently took a controversial trip to the Arctic island.\nBut Pew found that most survey respondents (54%) did not think the US should take over the Danish territory. When asked if they think Trump would actually pursue the plan, 23% thought it was extremely likely, but a greater number (34%) said they believed he would not carry through with it.\nTrump also proposed an American takeover of the Gaza Strip, resettling two million Palestinians in neighbouring countries with no right of return. This would violate international law and has been described as \"tantamount to ethnic cleansing\" by the UN.\nOf those surveyed, 62% of Americans opposed such a move, compared to 15% who favoured it. Opinions were divided as to whether Trump was likely to actually pursue it. Again, the greater number (38%) thought it very or extremely unlikely.\nTrump signed executive orders to remove the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Paris Agreement on climate change, and said USAID largely would be shut down.\nMore Americans disapprove than approve of such moves, the survey suggests - although the results are not a landslide.\nAt the start of his second presidency, Trump said he would \"work together, very closely\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine - a very different approach to that of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\nThe Pew research found 43% of respondents thought Trump favoured Russia too much - a higher number than the 31% who said he was striking the right balance between both sides. \nSince the survey was conducted, however, Trump's mood appears to have changed. He has said he is \"very angry\" with Putin over Ukraine negotiations.\nMeanwhile, Trump's relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown increasingly close this year.\nAnswering a question about whether Trump was favouring Israelis or Palestinians, 31% of those surveyed thought he favoured Israelis too much. Close behind at 29% were those who thought Trump was striking the right balance. \nLarger than either of these, however, was the group of respondents who were not sure (37%). Just 3% felt he was favouring  Palestinians too much.\nWhile Pew Research Centre is non-partisan, those surveyed were not.\nThe results showed that most of the respondents (64%) who described themselves as Republican - or Republican-leaning - supported the move by the Republican president to end USAID, for example. \nThat compared to just 9% of opposing Democrats - or Democratic-leaning - respondents who felt the same way, indicating a high level of polarisation.\nGenerally, it is older adults who support Trump's foreign policy actions, more than younger adults, the research suggested.\nPew also asked about tariffs on China, although this research was carried out before the situation escalated sharply into the trade war that is now under way.\nGenerally, more Americans said the tariffs would be bad for them personally, but those who were Republican, or leant more towards that party, believed the tariffs would benefit the US.",

        "article_text": "Take a four-hour slow train through the Eastern Ghats to discover how a remote hill station is changing the global coffee game.\nEven in December, early mornings are rarely pleasant on much of India's Andhra Pradesh coast. The air is already muggy by 06:30 as a crowd mills restlessly on platform five at Visakhapatnam (Vizag) railway station. However, these would-be passengers are no ordinary commuters, but travellers gathered for an experience. When the Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special rolls onto the platform, the crowd's relief is palpable; the two vistadome coaches at the back of the train that they've been anxiously waiting to board are air-conditioned.\u00a0\nIndians have only a nodding acquaintance with the concept of queues, so a mad scramble ensues as the train comes to a halt. Things settle down as it chugs out of the station and gradually picks up speed. The Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special also serves as a regular commuter service headed to the town of Kirandul in Chhattisgarh state, about 400km to the north-west, and takes about 14 hours to traverse the distance. But those in the vistadome coaches are interested only in the first leg, to Araku Valley. This serene hill station is about 120km away but takes four hours as the train winds its way through a whopping 58 tunnels cut through the Eastern Ghats. The two vistadome coaches \u2013 with their extra-large windows and rotatable seats \u2013 are designed to provide panoramic views of the area's mountain peaks and valleys and its gentle forested slopes that end in rushing rivers and streams, gorges and rocky promontories.\nAs the train whizzes past Vizag's neighbourhoods and suburbs, it provides snapshots of a city waking up: a vegetable vendor hauling their cart, a dog walker pulled by his dog, two bleary-eyed uniformed children clutching onto their father on a scooter to school. As the city segues into wide open fields and farmlands, the images change: smoke curls lazily into the sky from a lone thatched house in the middle of a farm, a diligent farmer urges on his oxen, a tractor hauls vegetables to the nearby market. The rhythmic clickety-clack of the train's wheels is familiar and soporific.\u00a0\u00a0\nLess than 30 minutes after leaving Vizag, the train slows considerably and begins ascending into the foothills of the Eastern Ghats. As if on cue, most seats in the coach swing to face the windows. The train climbs, plains fall away and even the sporadic habitations clinging to the peaks vanish. Hills and mountains in the distance appear blue-grey in the tender morning sun. But even before this panorama can register, complete darkness descends as the train enters the route's first tunnel. I'm startled by the sounds of adults and children screaming, in jest of course, for the few minutes it takes for us to come out the other side.\nWhen we emerge into daylight, the sight is jaw-dropping: a series of hillocks and gentle valleys, thickly forested, stretch out to the horizon where a haze-shrouded mountain range is just a hint of the soaring peaks to come. As I try to take in as much of the scene as possible, darkness descends again, and with it, more screaming.\nOn the other side is another surreal and dramatic sight: tracks bent around a hill, a green wall sloping straight up on one side, and a sheer drop on the other. The train slowly chugs forward, hugging the inner curve. The vistadomes' rear position means that the entire length of the train is visible, curling against the hill as if teetering on the edge. It then uncoils and wraps itself on the other side, trundling on a bridge built over a stream that gently flows several metres below. The bridge has no continuous guardrails, so, for a moment, it feels like the train is suspended in the air. But soon, the feeling is interrupted by darkness and more screaming, and another breathtaking view on the other side.\nTrain Journeys\nTrain Journeys is a BBC Travel series that celebrates the world's most interesting train rides and inspires readers to travel overland.\nThis sequence repeats over and over again and yet it never gets predictable or boring. Each of the route's 58 tunnels sets up anticipation for what might lay on the other side. Thick curtains of mist clinging to mountainsides or low-hanging clouds cloaking the peaks; rolling grasslands and forests spread out like someone had shaken out a giant green blanket and laid it down; deep valleys and gorges surrounded by undulating peaks; and fleeting glimpses of hamlets and habitations perched precariously on the hillsides.\u00a0\nWe stop every few minutes to drop and pick up commuters at musical-sounding stations that could be tongue-twisters to those unfamiliar: Pendurthi, Kottavalasa, Chimidipalli, Borraguhallu, Karakavalasa. At Shimiliguda, the station proudly wears its altitude on its sleeve: 996m above sea level. Throughout the journey, there is also a continuous parade of food vendors, delectable aromas wafting from their baskets as they sell idli-vada-chutney (a common breakfast of steamed rice cake with coconut chutney), samosa, savoury puffed rice and boiled peanuts.\nWhen the train finally rolls into Araku town, the station is crowded and noisy and the magic of the journey dissipates somewhat. But early next morning, Araku's appeal is on full display. A short walk leads to forests and coffee plantations speckled with tall silver oak trees, their trunks wrapped by pepper vines. Everything is covered in thick fog and the air is nippy, a far cry from Vizag's mugginess. The air is sappy and thick with terpenes. I catch faint whiffs of coffee and pepper.\nCoffee came to Araku with the British and was grown in scattered patches of plantations. Like other coffee-growing regions in India, Araku was an ideal location owing to its combination of soil, altitude and weather. After independence from British rule in 1947, the land passed into local government hands, but decades of underdevelopment and sporadic insurgency kept the region off most investment maps. That began to change in the early 2000s.\u00a0\n\"The local community wanted progress,\" says Manoj Kumar, CEO of the Naandi Foundation, a non-profit that works with farmers through community initiatives and sustainable models. \"So we looked around and thought since coffee was already growing in pockets, it could be expanded.\"\nWorking with local farmers, the organisation began establishing micro-plots of Arabica coffee using regenerative agriculture. What began at around 1,000 acres in 2002 currently stands at 100,000 acres farmed by more than 90,000 families, who each own about an acre on average. Besides coffee, farmers have been encouraged to multi-crop and now produce pepper, red kidney beans, ginger, turmeric, millets, rice, vegetables, fruits such as chikoo (sapodilla), mango, custard apple and avocado.\u00a0The result: a unique fair-trade coffee model known as Arakunomics, which won the Rockefeller Foundation's Food System Vision 2050 Prize in 2020.\nBut the foundation didn't stop there. In a first for Indian coffee, they \"terroir-mapped\" the beans \u2013 borrowing a concept from winemaking \u2013\u00a0and classified the end product into six distinct flavour profiles under the brand name ARAKU. Selective harvesting, sustainable practices and meticulous post-harvest processes have helped the beans consistently score 91/100 on specialty coffee rankings.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022 Malaysia's iconic 'Jungle Railway'\n\u2022 The Baltic Express: Central Europe's new hop-on hop-off train\n\"We grow about 2,000 metric tons of coffee, 98% of which is sourced by specialty coffee promoters across the world,\" Kumar says.\nTravellers can explore this story at various coffee holdings in the area, but Priya Rajagopal, a coffee enthusiast and former project manager in tech, recommends the Sunkarametta Coffee Plantation, about 13km south-east of Araku, where a wooden bridge runs for a few hundred metres through the plantation, suspended above the coffee plants and flanked by towering silver oaks. \"When I went, it was the flowering season (March to May) and the plants were full of white flowers, \" she says. \"The air is filled with a sweet, jasmine-like smell.\"\nA short distance away, the modest but informative Araku Coffee Museum offers a primer on the journey from seed to cup. The small adjacent caf\u00e9 serves a robust filter brew \u2013 earthy, rich and perfect for a chilly morning in the hills.\u00a0\nA few days after the train trip, back in Bengaluru, I head to the sole ARAKU cafe in India (most of their production is either exported, retailed in stores or available online), which is tucked away in the tree-lined avenues of the city's Indiranagar neighbourhood. I am torn between the various options but opt for their signature medium roast. It is beautifully rich red-brown and utterly mellow on the tongue. More importantly, a subtle peppery end note immediately transports me back to Araku\u2019s mist-covered winding lanes, the lush green forests and plantations \u2013 and the slow, soulful train ride that led me there.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "For the first time in decades, Lyle and Erik Menendez say they are beginning to feel hope they could get parole. It is a shift in mindset for the brothers, who have spent more than 30 years behind bars for the murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home.\n\"My brother and I are cautiously hopeful,\" Lyle Menendez, 57, said in a recent jailhouse interview with TMZ, which was aired on Fox.\n\"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he added.\nThe Menendez brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.\nThe case shocked the nation - not only for the brutal nature of the crime, but also for the courtroom drama that followed.\nTheir first trial ended in a hung jury after both brothers detailed years of sexual abuse they claimed to have suffered at the hands of their father, a high-powered music industry executive.\nBut prosecutors in the second trial cast doubt on those claims, arguing the brothers had acted out of greed and wanted to inherit their parents' wealth. The jury agreed, and the brothers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nOver the decades, the brothers have kept up their appeals - and recently learned that they would get a parole hearing after all.\nWith that hearing scheduled for June, and a resentencing hearing in the middle of April, the brothers are reflecting on how they will lead their lives if freed.\n\"What it is that I want to do in terms of my day-to-day life is much of what I'm doing in here. I want to be an advocate for people that are suffering in silence,\" 54-year-old Erik Menendez told TMZ.\n\"Lyle and I aren't talking about leaving prison - should we be able to get out - and not looking back. Our lives will be spent working with the prison and doing the work that we're doing in here, out there,\" he added.\nPart of the bid for parole hinges on a risk assessment that evaluates whether the brothers are still seen as threats to society.\nThe brothers say they have changed in prison.\n\"I'm striving to be a better person every day, and I want to be a person that my family can be proud of,\" said Erik Menendez. \"Who I've evolved into, who I've seen Lyle evolve into. I'm beginning to like myself, be proud of myself, and find it's okay to like myself.\"\nDuring their time in prison, both Erik and Lyle have started rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates and taught classes on trauma healing and meditation.\n\"Our best moments are the ones that are not spoken about, and we just help somebody, or we help an animal, or we make somebody smile that's feeling down that might have gone and harmed themselves if we weren't there,\" Erik said, speaking of their volunteer work in prison.\nDespite the upcoming parole hearing, the brothers' future - and the other possible paths to freedom - remain uncertain.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman recently withdrew a motion for resentencing that had been filed under his predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, signalling a harder stance on the case.\nHochman has publicly said he will not support the brothers' release, though the final decision rests with a judge.\nThe move has stirred controversy with the DA's office as two former prosecutors who worked under Gasc\u00f3n and advocated for the brothers' resentencing, have filed a legal case against Hochman - accusing him of harassment, retaliation, and defamation. \nThe pair claim they were demoted because of their stance on the case - and have faced intense public scrutiny as a result. Mr Hochman's office is yet to comment.\nSome members of the Menendez family have also criticized Mr Hochman, suggesting he is letting personal bias influence his actions. Mr Hochman denies this.\n\"Hochman doesn't seem to want to listen or engage with us,\" the brothers' cousin Tamara Goodell told US media. Ms Goodell accused the prosecutor of dismissing and ignoring the family, and \"not acting like a neutral party\".\nBut public opinion remains divided.\nIn the same TMZ special, Alan Abrahamson, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the Menendez trials in the 1990s, said the brothers are \"two of the most skilled and accomplished liars\".\n\"The Menendezes are very capable of shapeshifting, and being who people who want them to be,\" Mr Abrahamson said. \"And I think this is one of the grave dangers of this discussion that people don't seem to pick up on.\"\nThat is a thought shared by a former Beverly Hills detective who was assigned to investigate the murders at the time.\n\"This is the most heinous murder case I've had,\" Tom Linehan told TMZ. He believes the Menendez brothers were money-motivated killers who grew up getting exactly they wanted.\n\"If somebody is challenging what they want to do, they'd take them out if they had to,\" Linehan added.\nAs for the brothers, they have to hope the parole board sees things differently, so they will continue to fight their legal case.\n\"You never know how long you'll be blessed to be on the Earth, so we don't sit around waiting for something,\" Lyle said.",

We know that tomorrow will be a difficult game against a strong opponent... At least I've lifted trophies with the greatest club in the world. Some can't say the same,\" said Onana.\nThe 29-year-old has played 93 matches since his \u00a343.8m move from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023.\nIn all club competitions, he has conceded 137 goals and kept 23 clean sheets, conceding an average of 1.47 goals per game.\nNine of those 23 clean sheets have come in the Premier League this season, the fourth highest in the league, despite United sitting 13th in the Premier League table.\nSince the start of 2023-24, only Jordan Pickford (8.7) has prevented more goals based on Opta's expected goals model in the Premier League than Manchester United's Andre Onana (7.5).\nSince moving to the Premier League, Onana has ranked second on Opta's goals prevented metric, only behind Jordan Pickford in the Premier League over the past two campaigns.\nOpta calculate that Onana has actually conceded 7.5 goals fewer than expected from the quality of shots faced; with Pickford on 8.7.\nHowever, Onana has made high profile errors, especially in last season's awful Champions League group stage exit.\nAnd in the Premier League since 2023-24, only three goalkeepers have made more errors leading to goals than Onana has (4) - Arijanet Muric with seven and Robert Sanchez and Bart Verbruggen, both with six.\nSince the 2003-04 season, Onana tops the charts for the amount of saves made per game. Onana makes 3.4 saves per 90 minutes. In comparison, De Gea made 2.8 saves per 90 minutes and Van der Sar 2.5. \nOnana does not rank as well for save percentage. Andres Lindegaard is the only goalkeeper with a lower save percentage. De Gea, Van der Sar, Tim Howard, Dean Henderson, Ben Foster, Roy Carroll and Tomasz Kuszack all rank higher.\nIn the Premier League, Onana has the lowest number of minutes per goal conceded of all Manchester United goalkeepers - conceding every 63 minutes, on average. \nLindegaard was next on the list, every 81 minutes; De Gea every 84 minutes, Peter Schmeichel every 106 minutes, Van der Sar every 117 minutes and top of the list was Carroll, who conceded every 152 minutes.\nHe is playing in a Manchester United team in the bottom half of the Premier League table. The lowest the club has ever finished is eighth, in Onana's first season.\nRed Devils head coach Ruben Amorim described the team as \"maybe the worst\" in the club's 147-year history in January.\nOnly Raimond van der Gouw ranks lower than Onana for clean sheet percentage in the Premier League for United. Ben Foster has the highest percentage at 50% - but from just 12 appearances. \nVan der Sar, Schmeichel and De Gea - the only three goalkeepers with over 100 Premier League appearances - had clean sheet percentages of 48.4%, 44.4% and 35.4%, respectively.\nHow much are Premier League referees paid?\nHow does the new Club World Cup work & why is it so controversial?\nWho decides the Match of the Day running order?\nWhy do different football competitions have different balls?\nDo you have questions for the Ask Me Anything team?

        "article_text": "On 12 March, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was driving home with his young son in Maryland when he was stopped by agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nAgents took Mr Garcia into custody, then shuttled him to detention facilities in Louisiana and Texas. \nAccording to a federal judge, after three days, \"without any notice, legal process, or hearing\", Mr Garcia found himself back in his native El Salvador at an infamous prison known for housing gang members. \nThe government said he was deported due to an \"administrative error\".\nBut despite that, Mr Garcia remains incarcerated in El Salvador as lawyers debate the unusual intricacies of the case. \nA Maryland court ordered Mr Garcia be returned to the US,  but Trump officials argued that they cannot compel El Salvador to return Mr Garcia. The administration also argued that the judge ordering his return lacked the authority to do so.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court put a temporary hold on lower court orders while they consider the matter.\nImmigration experts say that as US President Donald Trump takes a hardline approach on illegal immigration, this case has the potential to upend due process  for immigrants.\n\"If the US Supreme Court were to accept [the Trump administration's] position, it would completely eviscerate any rule of law in the immigration process,\" Maureen Sweeney, director of the University of Maryland's Chac\u00f3n Center for Immigrant Justice, told the BBC.  \n\"Because they could pick up anybody, at any time, and send them anywhere with no repercussions whatsoever.\"\nUS District Judge Paula Xinis wrote in a filing Sunday that ICE officials did not follow procedures in the Immigration and Nationality Act when they deported Mr Garcia to El Salvador.\nShe ruled the US must bring him back before midnight on Monday. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, writing that the US \"has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street\".\nYet the Trump administration has argued that it cannot comply, saying Judge Xinis' filing is outside her jurisdiction.\n\"Neither a federal district court nor the United States has authority to tell the Government of El Salvador what to do,\" US Solicitor General D John Sauer wrote in an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nNicole Hallett, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School said that while it is true - US district judges cannot order El Salvador to take action -  they can order the US government to have Mr Garcia returned.\nShe also said the US has previously facilitated the return of mistakenly deported individuals.\nProf Hallett also questioned the government's claim that the US is powerless to compel El Salvador to release Mr Garcia, citing an agreement between the two countries.\nThe US, under the Trump administration, paid El Salvador's government $6m to house prisoners it sends, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Top officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump himself have publicly touted the arrangement.\n\"It's almost as if the Salvadoran government is acting as an agent of the US government,\" Ms Hallett said, arguing that this makes the release more plausible.\nMr Garcia's lawyers argued that because El Salvador was detaining Mr Garcia \"at the direct request and pursuant to financial compensation\" from the US, the court could order the US government to request his return.\nThe Department of Justice, however, has resisted calls to take such action.\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi said Tuesday that \"it was an administrative error as to why he was deported,\" but maintained the allegation that Mr Garcia belonged to a gang.\n\"We believe he should stay where he is,\" she said.\nMr Garcia is among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans deported under the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison. Officials allege they are gang members and therefore are subject to deportation.\nMr Garcia, who is married to a US citizen, does not have any gang ties and has never been charged with a crime, his lawyer says.\nHe was also protected by a \"withholding of removal\" order, which means the US government cannot send him back to El Salvador because he could face harm. The order dates back to 2019, when ICE first took Mr Garcia into custody and alleged he belonged to the MS-13 criminal organisation, an allegation he denied at the time.\nSuch orders are common, immigration lawyers told the BBC, and are an alternative to asylum protections.\n\"It was an unlawful act, for the US to return him to the country where he could not be returned,\" said Amelia Wilson, director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at Pace University.\nA judge ultimately granted Mr Garcia the 2019 order after he \"testified about how he was a victim of gang violence in El Salvador when he was a teenager and he came to the US to escape all of that,\" his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, wrote in a March 2025 affidavit.\nDepartment of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni acknowledged that at the time the \"government did not appeal that decision, so it is final\".\nThe Trump administration now reiterates allegations that Mr Garcia belonged to MS-13, but Judge Xinis said the government made this claim \"without any evidence\" and had not produced a removal order or warrant.\nThe Trump administration continues to press its case to the nation's highest court, setting up a potential showdown over the White House's deportation strategy.\nChief Justice John Roberts issued an administrative stay on Monday night, pausing lower court rulings while the US Supreme Court considers the government's appeal.\nPresident Trump touted the stay as a victory, writing on Truth Social that the ruling allowed the president \"to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself.\"\nImmigration lawyers, meanwhile, are watching Mr Garcia's case closely, considering it a test for how much power the administration can exert over US immigration.\n\"If the Trump administration is trying to remove these individuals by bypassing the immigration courts,\" said Ms Wilson, \"there's a direct and obvious line between what they're doing, and an effort by the administration to completely usurp judicial and due process.\"",

        "article_text": "Listen to James read this article\n\"The best salesman in history.\" This was what Donald Trump once called Volodymyr Zelensky because of the amount of aid the US has given Ukraine.\nWhether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.\nHis transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day. \nIn the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.\nBut with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.\nPolitically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests. \nBut is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?\nLater today the \"coalition of the willing\", a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine, will meet at Nato headquarters - notably without America. \nBefore Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.\nHis message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.\n\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nHis decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold. \n\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"\nLeshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"\nUkraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.\nLater in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.\n\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.\n\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"\nBut when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.\nAfter Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.\nMaria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.\n\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.\n\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"\nOn 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.\nOn that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.\nTensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".\nAfter the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.\nDespite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry. \nThe pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.\n\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.\nMr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".\n\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"\n\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Penta Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"\nThen there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".\nWhile Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.\n\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"\nWhen it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".\nHis defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.\nZelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.\nA mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv. \nThe US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.\nBut the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.\n\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"\nWhen the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.\n\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"\nWhatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.\nYet others argue more bend still is needed.\n\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.\n\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"\nMr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"\nAnd yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.\n\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.\nOrysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.\n\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".\nMr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".\nSome political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.\n\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"\nProf Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".\nStill, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.\nFor now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.\nAs for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?\n\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Vicky Riddell\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "For the first time in decades, Lyle and Erik Menendez say they are beginning to feel hope they could get parole. It is a shift in mindset for the brothers, who have spent more than 30 years behind bars for the murders of their parents in their Beverly Hills home.\n\"My brother and I are cautiously hopeful,\" Lyle Menendez, 57, said in a recent jailhouse interview with TMZ, which was aired on Fox.\n\"Hope for the future is really kind of a new thing for us. I think Erik would probably agree with that. It's not something we've spent a lot of time on,\" he added.\nThe Menendez brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to life without parole for the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.\nThe case shocked the nation - not only for the brutal nature of the crime, but also for the courtroom drama that followed.\nTheir first trial ended in a hung jury after both brothers detailed years of sexual abuse they claimed to have suffered at the hands of their father, a high-powered music industry executive.\nBut prosecutors in the second trial cast doubt on those claims, arguing the brothers had acted out of greed and wanted to inherit their parents' wealth. The jury agreed, and the brothers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nOver the decades, the brothers have kept up their appeals - and recently learned that they would get a parole hearing after all.\nWith that hearing scheduled for June, and a resentencing hearing in the middle of April, the brothers are reflecting on how they will lead their lives if freed.\n\"What it is that I want to do in terms of my day-to-day life is much of what I'm doing in here. I want to be an advocate for people that are suffering in silence,\" 54-year-old Erik Menendez told TMZ.\n\"Lyle and I aren't talking about leaving prison - should we be able to get out - and not looking back. Our lives will be spent working with the prison and doing the work that we're doing in here, out there,\" he added.\nPart of the bid for parole hinges on a risk assessment that evaluates whether the brothers are still seen as threats to society.\nThe brothers say they have changed in prison.\n\"I'm striving to be a better person every day, and I want to be a person that my family can be proud of,\" said Erik Menendez. \"Who I've evolved into, who I've seen Lyle evolve into. I'm beginning to like myself, be proud of myself, and find it's okay to like myself.\"\nDuring their time in prison, both Erik and Lyle have started rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates and taught classes on trauma healing and meditation.\n\"Our best moments are the ones that are not spoken about, and we just help somebody, or we help an animal, or we make somebody smile that's feeling down that might have gone and harmed themselves if we weren't there,\" Erik said, speaking of their volunteer work in prison.\nDespite the upcoming parole hearing, the brothers' future - and the other possible paths to freedom - remain uncertain.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman recently withdrew a motion for resentencing that had been filed under his predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, signalling a harder stance on the case.\nHochman has publicly said he will not support the brothers' release, though the final decision rests with a judge.\nThe move has stirred controversy with the DA's office as two former prosecutors who worked under Gasc\u00f3n and advocated for the brothers' resentencing, have filed a legal case against Hochman - accusing him of harassment, retaliation, and defamation. \nThe pair claim they were demoted because of their stance on the case - and have faced intense public scrutiny as a result. Mr Hochman's office is yet to comment.\nSome members of the Menendez family have also criticized Mr Hochman, suggesting he is letting personal bias influence his actions. Mr Hochman denies this.\n\"Hochman doesn't seem to want to listen or engage with us,\" the brothers' cousin Tamara Goodell told US media. Ms Goodell accused the prosecutor of dismissing and ignoring the family, and \"not acting like a neutral party\".\nBut public opinion remains divided.\nIn the same TMZ special, Alan Abrahamson, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the Menendez trials in the 1990s, said the brothers are \"two of the most skilled and accomplished liars\".\n\"The Menendezes are very capable of shapeshifting, and being who people who want them to be,\" Mr Abrahamson said. \"And I think this is one of the grave dangers of this discussion that people don't seem to pick up on.\"\nThat is a thought shared by a former Beverly Hills detective who was assigned to investigate the murders at the time.\n\"This is the most heinous murder case I've had,\" Tom Linehan told TMZ. He believes the Menendez brothers were money-motivated killers who grew up getting exactly they wanted.\n\"If somebody is challenging what they want to do, they'd take them out if they had to,\" Linehan added.\nAs for the brothers, they have to hope the parole board sees things differently, so they will continue to fight their legal case.\n\"You never know how long you'll be blessed to be on the Earth, so we don't sit around waiting for something,\" Lyle said.",

        "article_text": "Jonathan Haidt's book, The Anxious Generation, sparked a global reckoning about mobile phone usage among children when it came out last year. So, I checked in with him to find out if he still thinks childhood is at risk from too much screen time.\nParents need help. I know from experience. It's really hard to get kids off their screens when all their friends are stuck on theirs. This addiction demands collective action.\nIn the days since I spoke with Haidt, there's been one thing that he said that I haven't been able to get off my mind.\u00a0\n\"I have not met one member of Gen Z who's in denial, who says, 'No, we love the phones, the phones are good for us,'\" Haidt told me. \"They all see what's happening, but they feel trapped.\"\u00a0\nSo, has anything actually changed in the year since Haidt's book? Was all the hype around mobile phones just a flash-in-the-pan moment of collective parental anxiety or did it produce the kind of action many parents are longing for?\nWatch our full conversation, here:\nBelow is an excerpt from our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nKatty Kay: It's been a year since your book came out and caused a huge conversation. I wanted to start by getting a kind of report card of where we are on the various aspects of what you're trying to do: phones in school, age gating, social media, getting kids to have more free playtime. Who's doing well and who isn't in America on all of those issues?\u00a0\nJonathan Haidt: I knew that the book was going to be popular. What I wasn't prepared for is that this issue would spread like wildfire around the world, not just in the US. Because around the world, family life has turned into a fight over screen time. Everyone hates it. Everyone sees it.\nWhere it took off most quickly was phone-free schools, because that is something that is very easily done. It's so hard to teach to a classroom when half of them are watching short videos and playing video games. So, the teachers have hated the phones from the beginning but they were afraid, especially in America \u2013 maybe it's the same in the UK \u2013 but in America, there are a lot of parents who want to be able to communicate all the time with their child, and they think they have a right to check in on their child. And, 'What if something goes wrong? I need to be there.' So, the overparenting \u2014\nKK: That's a paradox, then, because you've got the parents who are super worried about the phones; they see what phones are doing to their kids. But they also don't want their kids to relinquish their phones when they go into school.\nJH: Hey, look, people are complicated! They contain multitudes. And I shouldn't say that everyone saw the problem, because there were a lot of parents who saw the phone as a lifeline. They see the world as very threatening and dangerous. And so, early on in this process, I thought there would be this uniquely American thing about overprotection, because we do have a lot more crime than you do in Europe or Canada.\u00a0\nBut the surprising thing, to me, as I've been studying this for a while now, is that the vast overprotection swept through all of the English-speaking countries in the '90s. So, all the English-speaking countries went through this at the same time. And now, all of them are taking action really quickly. UK and Australia, I'd say, are in the lead in terms of actually passing legislation.\nKK: Here in the United States, we've seen some battles go through Congress, but this has not happened at a national level. What I am seeing is individual states enact laws to stop kids having phones in school.\u00a0\nJH: That's right, because we don't have a functioning legislature in the United States. We have Congress. And Congress can't really do anything if anybody objects. So, from the beginning, I have not assumed we're going to get a damn bit of help from Congress. I've been focusing on the 50 US states and on the UK, Australia and the EU. If we get legislative change in those domains, we win.\nKK: Is it too early to see what the impact is in schools that ban phones? Do we have any data on that yet or is this just a supposition that they're going to do better?\u00a0\nJH: We have reports from schools that go phone-free. And I challenge people to look around for a school that went truly phone-free, not just during class time. If it's just a restriction during class time, that's not phone-free. That causes all kinds of problems. All the kids are on their phones in between classes. But truly phone-free, where you turn in phones in the morning and you get back in the evening, the reports are raves.\u00a0\nThe most common things they say are that discipline problems are down. There's just a lot less fighting, a lot less drama. Truancy is down. School is a lot more fun when you can actually talk with your friends and play with them and laugh with them. So, truancy goes down, tardiness goes down, kids arrive on time. And the most thrilling thing for me, and the most universal thing they say is we hear laughter in the hallways again. So, the reports are uniformly raves. There's often some resistance in the first week or two, but what they mostly say is \u2014\nKK: Who's the resistance from?\u00a0\nJH: Some of the kids don't like it and some of the parents don't like it. But I've spoken to hundreds and hundreds of school superintendents. What they're telling me is they expected a huge pushback from parents, but they actually didn't get it. Because this year is different. The zeitgeist has changed.\nActually, it started in the UK even before my book came out. You had smartphone-free schools; they went viral in February of last year and my book didn't come out until March. So, it's a different environment now, and schools are ready to act. Now, there are some studies, there are some academic studies that have been equivocal, but when you look at them \u2013 there was one that came out in the UK, it was published in the Lancet.\nIt said phone-free schools don't help. No, it didn't. It looked at like eight schools that had a backpack policy, which is not very good, and then like 11 or 15 schools that had a classroom-ban policy. It was like there was a slight difference in policies. These are very different schools. So, we have a Substack post showing this Lancet study doesn't show anything of the sort. There was a study in the UK done by Policy Exchange, where they looked at several hundred UK schools, and only about 10% are truly phone-free. If you look at the schools in the UK that are truly phone-free, and you compare them to the others, then you do find academic benefits and behavioural benefits.\nKK: I want to go back to something you said at the beginning about the 1990s and how that became a time of fear. I've been a working mother my whole life. I have four children: two of whom were born in the 90s, one was born in 2000, one was born in 2006. So, they've all had different experiences with screens. But from the research that I've done, something else happened in the kind of 80s and 90s, which was a sort of expansion of what we deem to be a good parent, and more specifically than that, a good mother, right? So, women were taking on full-time jobs and still doing the overwhelming share of household chores.\nBut it's not just that. In my research, women today are doing as much in the way of household chores as their great-grandmothers were in the early part of the 1900s. It's that society somehow deemed us not to be good parents if we weren't spending an enormous amount of time with our kids, spending our weekends running ragged taking them to events. And somehow you got, particularly perhaps if you were a working mother, the kind of guilt exploded. I feel like screens \u2013 and I've seen it with my own kids \u2013 screens just became a kind of form of relief for parents, and mothers in particular, from whom society was just asking impossible things.\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0Every word you said is true. I'll just try to add on to it. It is a puzzle. And I've got a really bizarre graph in the book showing that the amount of time that mothers and fathers spent parenting was fairly flat in the 80s and even into the 90s. And then all of a sudden in the mid 1990s, at least in the US, it jumped up. Something changed in the 90s. And it's the norm that you're talking about.\u00a0\nKK:\u00a0Great, I moved here in '96, so I just hit right at the right moment! [Laughter]\nJH:\u00a0You just hit it! That's right. So, that really did happen. Women today have fewer children than their grandmothers did, and they're working outside the home, which their grandmothers didn't, and they're spending more time with the kids. So, a lot of this has fallen on women.\u00a0\nNow, why did this happen? The best answer comes from this really wonderful book called Paranoid Parenting by Frank Furedi. He's a British sociologist and he's focusing on what happened in the UK, not the US, although he points out that the same things happened in the US and Canada. And what happened, he says, is we lost trust in other people. And when that happens, then we don't trust our neighbourhood. We don't trust people to send our kids out.\u00a0\nIt's always been the case that raising kids was kind of a joint project. When you lose that, now every family is on their own. And that means it's mostly the mothers who are on their own.\nKK:\u00a0In your sort of meta analysis of screens and kids and schools, and whether we can have phones in schools, is it actually the case that we have to address those issues before we can really wean our kids off this screen addiction?\nJH:\u00a0We have to understand those issues first if we want to fully understand what happened historically. But I would not say that we have to address those issues first, because, frankly, we're not going to address them. I mean reversing the decline of community, you know, I go to all kinds of meetings about that. There are all kinds of foundations. But look, technology changes society \u2014\nKK:\u00a0Can you just fix it all, Jon? [Laughter] I mean, I know you've done phones in schools, but really, step it up!\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0[Laughter] Yeah. Let's fix community next! So, no, we're not going to restore trust in our neighbours such that we can let our kids out. That's not going to happen. In fact, it's likely to get a lot worse as we go into the\u00a0era of AI, when we have no idea what's true. We're never going to know what's true again for a very long time, if ever. So, rather, we have to adapt to this. And I think the way we adapt to this onslaught of technology is by saying, \"Okay, you know what? Kids are not adults.\"\nWe have to focus on what it will take to allow kids to have healthy brain development through puberty. That's my mission. We've got to give kids a lot less screen time. A lot less fragmenting time. No TikTok. No short videos. That's the worst, and give them a lot more experience interacting with people.\nKK:\u00a0What do you say to poorer families where both parents have to work multiple jobs and for whom the invention of screen content that occupies their small children is just literally a lifesaver for them? Is there a different argument there or not?\nJH:\u00a0Yes, there is. So, the way to understand this is that in the 90s, when we were all techno-optimists, the internet was amazing. The early internet was amazing. And rich kids had computers and internet access and poor kids didn't. And so in the 1990s, we had a big thing, you know, it was educational equity.\u00a0Bill Gates, all kinds of philanthropists donated hundreds of millions of dollars. Let's get every kid a computer.\nSo, in the early 2000s, we're all techno-optimists and we think, 'Well, okay, I don't trust my kid to walk three blocks to a store, but he's on a computer. What could happen? He's learning! That's great!' We think it's good that our kids are upstairs on a computer. And, of course, this is one of the central ideas in the\u00a0Netflix show Adolescence\u00a0is, you know, parents think their kids are safe when they're on a computer. And in the 90s, they mostly were. There was some bad stuff, too, but they mostly were.\u00a0\nBut once the internet gets taken over, or at least once childhood gets\u00a0owned by three or four big companies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0TikTok, Snap, Meta and Google \u2013 once childhood is owned by these companies that are using algorithms to send them content, to keep them hooked, this is when things get much darker. Kids on computers now, they're not learning to program. They're not learning any useful skills. They're just basically lying there consuming content. And this is when it gets really sick and really dark.\nEditorial Note:\nTikTok told the BBC's Marianna Spring it has \"industry-leading\" safety settings for teens, and Meta cites its own tools for \"positive and age-appropriate experiences\". Read more about how social media companies address concerns of children's safety online, here.\nBut we don't quite realise that. And so what's happened now is the educational equity issue has reversed. It used to be \"get poor kids computers\". But by the 2000s, what was clear was that the rich people, and especially the people in Silicon Valley, don't let their kids have this stuff. So, now the great educational equity imperative is we've got to give the poor kids the same protections that the rich kids have. We've got to get them less time on screens. You said it's literally a lifesaver. I would say no, it's not literally a lifesaver. It literally is a brain-scrambler.\nKK: A lot of what you write about and the way you write is targeted at adults. If you were to go into schools and talk to middle school children, what would be the most effective argument you could make to them?\nJH: I'm glad you asked that, because just before our conversation, I was in an hour-long conversation with my team. We're creating a version of The Anxious Generation for 8-to-12 year olds, for kids who don't yet have a smartphone. And the main thing that we want to convey to them is that there are these companies that are going to try to hook you. And they've hooked most kids. If you look at the kids older than you, they're not having fun. They're lonely, they're sad. Because they all got sucked into just being content consumers, that's all they do. But do you want to have an amazing, exciting life? Do you want to do things? Do you want to have fun with your friends?\nDon't go down that route. Don't let these companies trick you and suck you in. One of the key ideas in The Anxious Generation is this is not a book about screens; this is a book about childhood. What kind of childhood do we want for our kids?\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Markets are reeling from US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, but the American leader is standing by his decisions, defending his policies and saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\". \nExperts answered some of the questions you sent us as the world tries to make sense of the turmoil and wonders how long it will continue.\nRead their answers below.\nSimon Jack, the BBC's business editor, said the FTSE 100, which represents the 100 biggest companies publicly listed in the UK, were all \"put in a big bucket back in 1984\" and given a certain weighting in that bucket depending on how big those companies were. \nThe stock market is a reflection of their total value over time. The bigger the company, the more weight it has in the index. For example, an AstraZeneca or an HSBC has more weight than others.\nIt works the same in the US with the S&P500, which is made up of the 500 biggest companies, with an enormous concentration in some names like Apple, Nvidia and Amazon. \nThe stock market tells you how the value of the shares in those companies has changed - with a focus on those biggest names.\nGenerally speaking, it is an indication of what some of our biggest companies are worth, and when they go up or down, it tells you something about the sentiment of whether their profits are likely to rise or fall in the future.\nJack explains that what happens in stock markets is not necessarily the same thing that happens in the economy. They can be linked, but they are not exactly the same. \nSome people invest directly in shares - and this will definitely affect them. These are some big falls, some of the biggest we have seen in a couple days since pandemic panic gripped the markets back in 2020.\nThe other way that people are exposed to these changes is through their pension funds. Pension fund investing is a long term game. Not all of your money will go into shares - some will go into government bonds, and the closer you get to retirement, the more weighting you will have in things like cash and government bonds, so the less this will affect you. \nThere are two types of pensions: a defined benefit pension - where you get a promised percentage of your salary at retirement - and defined contribution - where your pension pots value will rise and fall with financial markets.\nPensions are exposed right now, but pension investing is a long term game. \nThe warning sign flashing here is not the value of your pension pot - it is what is going to happen to the economies in which we all live and work.\nA lot of people are saying the chance of recession in both the US, UK - and even globally - have gone up a notch, which has implications for things like jobs and wages.\nThere is growing scepticism about tariffs among Americans, although views still fall along partisan lines.\nAccording to one poll released last week, slightly more than half of Republicans, 52%, think tariffs help the economy, but 58% of independents say they hurt the economy, as do 89% of Democrats. \nHowever, that survey was held before Trump's global tariffs came into effect and trillions of dollars was wiped off the value of the US stock market. We will find out in the coming days how the economic turmoil has changed public sentiment. \nOne of the key factors in President Trump's 2024 election victory was that more voters trusted him to improve the US economy, and especially to tackle high prices.\nYet most economists warn that tariffs could drive up prices for US consumers as almost all imported goods will face a tax. \nThere could be inflation and we could also see an economic downturn, and potentially a recession.\nSome think that the whole exercise is about an economic proxy war with China and the entire game is about just trying to level that playing field a little bit, Jack said.\nBut Trump is right in one regard, which is that American markets are much more open to foreign goods than a lot of foreign markets are open to US goods. \nThe UK, for example, puts a 10% tariff on US imported cars, 14% on some kinds of beef, and 8% on other things. So there are barriers both ways. \nAnd while Trump says that other countries have been ripping off the US, it is American corporations that have reasonably pursued shareholder value by trying to put their production facilities in the strategically and economically best places.\nIt is the head of American corporations who opened subsidiaries in Ireland, where there is a low tax rate, and put manufacturing in Vietnam or Cambodia. In a way this has been the sort of rational pursuit of maximum profit, a system which has made the US very rich indeed.\nChina is getting very rich indeed as well, and it is certainly moving up the value chain. \nThere is a feeling that the US was very comfortable when China was making cheap sneakers and t-shirts, but when China starts making supercomputers and missiles the US gets a little bit more concerned, and that is one of the reasons you are seeing some of these tensions come to the fore.\nThat is really the unknown question right now, Davison said, but one thing we can expect is more volatility. \nWe got a little bit of a sense of how markets react on Friday when Trump said he had spoken with Vietnamese officials and there was potentially a deal in the works for Vietnam. \nThe country has been hit with a 46% tariff by the US, which is quite a significant level, and Vietnam has indicated that it could reduce to zero all its tariffs on US goods going into that country. Stocks like Nike and Lululemon actually increase on that news, because these are apparel companies that have a very big presence in Vietnam.\nBroadly, I believe we are going to see markets go down, but you could see particular stocks moving in a more positive direction as there are indications that there may be some exemptions allowed. \nWe do not know what Trump will allow - he has sent some big signals at times saying that his policies will never change, but has also suggested that some deals are possible.",

        "article_text": "Max Verstappen won the Japanese Grand Prix for the fourth successive time as he fended off McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.\nFormula 1 now heads to Bahrain for the second race of a triple-header, from 11-13 April.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions.\nWhy do drivers rate Suzuka as their favourite circuit when pole usually wins and there is very little chance of overtaking? Sunday's race was quite boring once Max Verstappen got to the first corner before Lando Norris. - Stuart\nThe two things - the concept of a favourite circuit and one where overtaking is very difficult and the racing therefore sometimes uneventful - are not mutually exclusive.\nJust look at Monaco. The drivers love the challenge of the track, but accept the race is likely going to be processional. So too with Suzuka.\nSome drivers did remark on the lack of action. But Fernando Alonso had a more nuanced take.\nAlonso has won at both Monaco and Suzuka, and made one of his greatest - one of the greatest - overtaking moves there when he passed Michael Schumacher's Ferrari around the outside of 130R in 2005.\nAlonso said: \"This is Suzuka. I don't remember a race many times in the past where there is lots of overtaking without the weather changing.\n\"It seems every year we repeat always on Thursday how great Suzuka is, how great Monaco is, the glamour, the spectacular weekend, and then on Sunday we wake up and say: 'Ah, Monaco is boring, what can we do to the track? Suzuka is boring.'\n\"Instead of looking at the negative, I try to enjoy the experience, and it was another great Suzuka.\"\nOne thing is worth mentioning here. The resurfacing of the track in the first sector changed Suzuka this year from a circuit where tyre degradation was high, to one where it was low.\nThat changed the race from a two-stop strategy to a one. Add in the difficulty of overtaking to an event where there were no significant tyre-pace offsets developing, and the race was always likely to be processional.\nThis, though, led to a race that was driven pretty much flat out all the way by the drivers. And that - rare in the Pirelli era - they enjoy.\nSo just because it fell short as entertainment, as a challenge for the drivers, it was very real.\nMax Verstappen - sensational all weekend on his way to victory - said: \"It was a fun race. The whole race I saw two orange cars in my mirror and, especially those last 20 laps, we were pushing quite hard out there. You had to keep on fighting it, basically being on the limit.\"\nOn the limit for an hour and a half around the greatest circuit on the planet. No racing driver is ever going to find that boring.\nBahrain Grand Prix\n11-13 April - race starts at 16:00 BST on 13 April\nSakhir\nGiven the demotion to Racing Bulls for Liam Lawson, what are Jack Doohan's chances looking like at Alpine given that Franco Colapinto is a reserve driver? - Anjum\nWell, the first thing to say is just because Red Bull demoted Lawson, that does not necessarily mean Alpine will do the same to Doohan.\nOn the surface, the Australian has had a traumatic start to the season. In three races so far, he has had two massive, expensive crashes. One when he spun in the wet in Australia, and one in Friday practice in Japan. Both were his errors.\nDoohan was not the only driver to crash in the difficult wet conditions in Melbourne. Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz also did. And many more drivers spun or made mistakes.\nAnd there were some significant mitigating circumstances in Suzuka.\nDoohan's crash was caused by him entering Turn One with the DRS overtaking aid still open. So the car didn't have enough downforce to cope with the G-forces on it.\nHe had been doing the same in the simulator in preparation for the race, thinking the DRS was closing automatically. But with the small lift he had on this particular lap, it did not.\nAt the same time, given his inexperience, it perhaps would have been a good idea for the engineers to remind him of it.\nAlpine, though, had not realised he had been doing this in the simulator.\nAnother mitigating factor was Doohan was under pressure to make up time because he had missed first practice while reserve driver Ryo Hirakawa was given an outing in his car.\nWhy did Alpine not put Hirakawa in team-mate Pierre Gasly's car for first practice given Doohan's lack of experience at Suzuka? They had a difficult weekend in China and wanted to evaluate some new set-up ideas, for which they felt they needed Gasly's experience.\nDespite the two big accidents, Alpine feel Doohan has, on balance, had a positive start to the season, with some promising pace hidden by some unfortunate circumstances.\nBut he is certainly not safe yet.\nShould they decide to replace him, Alpine have two reserve drivers who could potentially step up - Colapinto and Estonian Paul Aron.\nSince signing Colapinto from Williams, following his cameo role in the final few races of last season, the theory has been the access to Latin American money the Argentine gives means Doohan is on borrowed time.\nBut that threat seems to have diminished for now, the funding perhaps more theoretical than real.\nUltimately, though, Doohan's fate rests on the whim of Alpine executive adviser Flavio Briatore. He'll decide what he decides, when he decides it.\nWas Yuki Tsunoda's Red Bull debut a success, and is he an improvement on Liam Lawson? - Ed\nTsunoda set himself the target of scoring points on debut at Red Bull, and finished the race 12th, behind the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso. So, by the standards he set himself, it was not a success.\nRed Bull want Tsunoda to be scoring good points to boost their bid for the constructors' title. So by their standards, it was not a success either.\nHaving said that, it certainly showed promise.\nHe started off strongly, being close on pace to Max Verstappen in first practice, and was again looking decent in final practice.\nIn first qualifying, again he was only 0.1secs from Verstappen.\nFor second qualifying, Red Bull chose to give him one set of used tyres and one of new - not unusual for a quick driver in a quick car, but perhaps a mistake given his lack of experience with the team.\nThat meant he had only one realistic shot at getting into the top 10 shootout. And Tsunoda made an error on his only flying lap on new tyres, going into Turn One 15km/h faster than ever before, and having a moment.\nHis race was dictated by qualifying 14th, but he did overtake Lawson on lap one then pull off an undercut pass on Pierre Gasly's Alpine.\nAs for comparisons with Lawson before him, Tsunoda was a definite step up. He was faster than Lawson ever was, and looked a lot more in control and confident.\nBut he will have to do better than this in the future to have any chance of keeping a seat at Red Bull in 2026.\nHow likely is it that George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli will race for Mercedes in 2026, with both out of contract this year? \u2013 John\nThe answer to this question depends entirely upon Max Verstappen.\nIf the world champion decides to stay at Red Bull, Mercedes will keep Russell and Antonelli next year.\nIf he decides to move, Mercedes is his most likely option, in which case Toto Wolff would have to decide which driver to keep.\nOn performance right now, that would be Russell. But Antonelli is only 18, just three races into his career, and believed to have rich promise. Jettisoning him after a year would be harsh indeed.\nIn that scenario, Russell is likely to be an attractive candidate to Red Bull, too.\nWhat will Verstappen do? For now, he is relaxed and waiting to see how the season develops. He is under contract to Red Bull until the end of 2028, but has performance-related get-out clauses if he wants to leave.\nThe difficulty in making any decision about the future is no-one is absolutely certain what next year and beyond will look like in terms of engines.\nMercedes are widely believed to be ahead on development of the new 2026 power-units. But their future is uncertain.\nFIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem is pushing for an early abandonment of the 2026 engine formula and a return to naturally aspirated V10s running on sustainable fuel. Why, he has yet to explain. But for now all that matters is he is.\nThat exact route looks unlikely to happen. Ferrari and Red Bull back the V10 idea, but it is not appealing to Mercedes, Honda or Audi - and that's more than enough manufacturers to vote that idea down under F1's rule structures.\nBut that does not mean a change won't come before 2031 - the current end of the new engine regs.\nPerhaps manufacturers would agree to a different, bigger engine - a V8, for example - with a turbo and some hybrid element, but not as much as the 50% of total power planned for next year.\nThere is a meeting to discuss F1's future engine direction in Bahrain on Friday and no-one knows what the conclusion will be - or indeed if there will be one.\nVerstappen will wait a little longer to see how things stand on many fronts before making any decision on his future.\nBetween a packed calendar, other commitments and strict regulations on costs, how much time do F1 drivers actually get to practise driving their cars during a season? Is it mostly simulator based? \u2013 Arv\nIn-season testing in current cars is forbidden by F1's regulations.\nDrivers are allowed to test in cars that are more than a year old. This was unrestricted for a while, but has for 2025 been limited for current drivers to 1,000km a year.\nDrivers can also participate in Pirelli tyre development tests in the latest cars, or whatever spec of car is required, if called upon.\nOther than that, the only \"practice\" they get is in the simulator.\nWhether the best drivers in the world need any practice in a year in which there are 24 grands prix is another question.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nHow Verstappen stole Suzuka with McLaren stuck in 'rabbit hole'\nJapanese Grand Prix Review\nHow to follow Bahrain Grand Prix on the BBC",

She said the doll celebrates \"LeBron as a role model,\" his ability as an icon to transcend culture and set a \"positive example for the next generation.\"\nThe doll features the Los Angeles Lakers basketball player in his pre-game fashion and reflects his height - it's an inch taller than the standard Ken doll. \nIn reality, the athlete is 6ft 9in tall.\nThe new doll comes as the company is facing financial uncertainty amid President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China, where just under 40% of Mattel's production is based.\nTrump announced on Wednesday that tariffs on goods from China would increase to 125%. He accused Beijing of a \"lack of respect\" after it retaliated and said it would impose tariffs of 84% on US imports.\nIn the same announcement, Trump announced a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs and authorised a universal \"lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%\" as negotiations continued with roughly 60 countries. \nMattel has said it may have to increase prices and possibly implement changes to its supply chain. Consumer and business groups in the US have warned that the tariffs may disrupt supply chains and lead to higher prices.\nThe new Ken doll doesn't show the athlete in his basketball uniform. Instead, he's dressed in a varsity jacket adorned with \"LJ\" on the front. \nIt includes an Ohio patch and a crown patch on one sleeve and the number 23 - his basketball jersey number - on the other. On the back, \"LeBron\" is boldly printed along with the phrase, \"Just a kid from Akron\" - the Ohio city where he was born. \nUnder the jacket, the doll wears a shirt that reads \"We Are Family,\" a nod to the star's foundation. The doll includes accessories like a basketball, headphones and sneakers.\nIn a promotional video released by Mattel, Mr James reacted to see the doll for the first time. \"Oh, he dope!\" he says as he's given the figurine. \"That's so cool!\" \nAs he toyed with the doll's accessories, he joked the LeBron Ken doll \"might have to do a little lifting, legs are looking skinny\". \nThe move is a significant moment for the 65-year-old Barbie brand, which has made a push in recent years to diversify its dolls and reflect a broader range of careers, body types and backgrounds.\nThough Barbie has previously honoured athletes like Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and Megan Rapinoe, Mr James is the first male sports figure - and the first male figure not from the entertainment industry - to join the lineup.\nEven with four NBA titles, two Olympic gold medals, and a scoring record to his name, Mr James says his new title of \"Kenbassador\" hits differently\u2014because it's about more than basketball.\n\"It's an opportunity to recognize the powerful impact of role models who instill confidence, inspire dreams, and show kids that they, too, can achieve greatness.\"",

        "article_text": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nMark Flekken (Brentford): Chelsea had 21 shots yet he kept a clean sheet. It wasn't a great game of football but he's one of only four goalkeepers who kept a clean sheet this weekend.\nDaniel Munoz (Crystal Palace): Scored for Palace and has become a monster at the back. Ever reliable and you want him in your Fantasy Premier League team all the time.\nCalvin Bassey (Fulham): By far the best player for Fulham, he was excellent.\nNoussair Mazraoui (Manchester United): Becoming Manchester United's most consistent defender, goes under the radar but makes a lot of last-ditch tackles - the one he made on Phil Foden kept them in the game.\nYouri Tielemans (Aston Villa): He's become undroppable for Villa, excellent. He had a year last year where you thought maybe they needed to move on and get someone better, but this year he's gone from strength to strength and has become a key component. Him and Boubacar Kamara, who was rested at the weekend, have built a massive presence of quality, tough tackling and reliability that Villa have built a foundation on.\nJoao Gomes (Wolves): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile. Wolves might be worried about losing Matheus Cunha but in my opinion Gomes is the one they need to watch, and will be the harder one to replace. Excellent footballer, took over the game in the second half when they were 1-0 down. Just said 'don't worry guys give me the ball, watch what I can do'.\nMorgan Rogers (Aston Villa): Time and time again for Villa, keeps going, keeps doing wonderful things. I think he will grow into a regular for England, I rate him that highly. If you put him on the left he still delivers but I think his natural position is the number 10 role. Having Marco Asensio there he can learn, he can understand and it will also put that fire in his belly that he wants to be the main man - even though there's wonderful players around him.\nJacob Murphy (Newcastle): Two great goals, has he been the most underrated player this season? I would say I don't know of anyone who has gone more under the radar, but has been a seven-and-a-half or an eight out of 10 every game. He's been excellent.\nRyan Sessegnon (Fulham): A massive win against Liverpool and I think he's waited for a long time to showcase the best version of himself. A lot of injuries, a lot of tough times at Fulham but he's having a run of form that is excellent.\nEvanilson (Bournemouth): I thought he was excellent again, two goals at the weekend. When people are struggling for a number nine I've managed to put two in my team.\nJorgen Strand Larsen (Wolves): A contender for most improved this season. He has developed into a top player, double figures for a team who are struggling. His confidence, touch and assist for the first goal were fantastic. Then a poacher's goal, a really good finish, for the second.\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa): A huge win for Aston Villa, building on what has been a fantastic season and now going into a massive Champions League tie against Paris St-Germain. Most people would have expected them to rest players and change players against a very good Forest team. They did change players, however they were excellent and still got the job done.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

        "article_text": "Authorities in India's Kuno National Park have started disciplinary action against a forest worker who is seen offering water to a cheetah and her cubs in a video that has gone viral online.\nThe man, a driver at the sanctuary, violated instructions which say only authorised personnel can go near the big cats, park officials told PTI news agency.\nCheetahs were declared extinct in India in 1952, the only large mammal to become extinct since the country's independence. \nThey were reintroduced in Kuno in 2022 as part of an ambitious plan to repopulate the species.\nThe incident came to light on Sunday, when a video of the man feeding water to the big cats began circulating online. \nThe footage shows him pouring water into a metal pan after being urged to do so by some people who aren't seen in the video.\nMoments later, a cheetah named Jwala and her four cubs walk up to the pan and start drinking from it. \nOfficials say it's not uncommon for certain staff members to offer water to big cats if they get close to the boundary of the national park to lure them back into the forest.\nThe mum and her cubs were in the fields close to the boundary, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI. \n\"The monitoring team, in general, has been instructed to try to deviate or lure the cheetahs back inside whenever such a situation arises so as not to create human-cheetah conflict,\" he said\nHowever, only trained personnel are allowed to do so and the man's actions went against established protocol, he added.\n\"There are clear instructions to move away from cheetahs. Only authorised persons can go in close proximity to them to perform a specific task,\" Mr Sharma said.\nInitial reports in the media called the video \"heartwarming\" but many on social media raised concerns about the safety of people and animals in such situations. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.\nVillages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Last month, some villagers pelted the cats with stones to stop such attacks, The New Indian Express newspaper reported. Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.\nTwenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\nEight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. \nIn 2023, South African and Namibian experts involved with the project wrote to India's Supreme Court, saying they believed that some of these deaths could have been prevented by \"better monitoring of animals and more appropriate and timely veterinary care\". \nExperts from the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which has been involved with the project since its inception, had also raised concerns about inadequate record-keeping at Kuno. They told the BBC that the park management had \"little or no scientific training\" and the vets were \"too inexperienced to manage a project of this calibre\".\nPark authorities have rejected the allegations and say there are now a total of 26 cheetahs, including 17 in the wild and nine others that are kept in enclosures at the moment.\nThis year, India is expected to receive 20 more cheetahs from South Africa. Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Some just stand there looking calm, some move around wildly and others spend a good chunk of time shadowing the fourth official.\nEvery manager does it differently - so we wanted to find out exactly how differently.\nOver the past three days, we sent a BBC Sport journalist to all 10 Premier League games to closely watch what every manager did as the action unfolded. \nThey spent the matches recording data on where each boss stood, while also surveying how they interacted with those around them. We know that there are many variables that can determine how a manager reacts so measuring across a single weekend is certainly not definitive, but we were curious to see what unfolded.\nThe data enabled us to produce a heatmap for every manager, which you can find below along with observations from each journalist.\nSome heatmaps will show a number that is either just above or just below 100%. That is because we rounded our percentages up or down to improve readability within the graphic.\nWe watched every Premier League manager - here's what we found out\nHow did we collect the data? Read our methodology\nMike Peter at Goodison Park: The touchlines are tight here, but that wasn't going to stop Mikel Arteta - he still squeezed out of his technical area almost 50% more than opposite number David Moyes.\nAnywhere close to the action was Arteta's domain, with his coaches, particularly set-piece lead Nicolas Jover, having to venture out to join him twice as much as Everton's backroom staff had to find Moyes. Jover, just as much an animated presence as his manager, immediately took up position in the very corner of the technical area for any set-piece.\nMoyes ventured around his area more freely, often stepping back in his box to discuss matters with his staff, and even taking a seat on the bench - something Arteta never did.\nNor was the dugout the only place the veteran Scot sat down - he was perched on a drinks cooler in the corner of his area when Everton scored their equalising penalty.\nMatch report\nGeorge Booth at Selhurst Park: Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner was an animated figure throughout - constantly moving in the technical area and never sitting down for long periods.\nHe did generally respect the white line, only leaving his technical area once in the first half, while in the final 10 minutes of the contest he was frequently interacting with the crowd in a bid to help his team over the line.\nFabian Hurzeler spent the majority of the first half outside his technical area, virtually inches away from the pitch, but was seated for most of the second half - despite the three red cards coming during this period.\nWhen his side faced a defensive set-piece, assistant manager Jonas Scheuermann took control of the technical area, with Brighton's players often looking back to follow instructions.\nThe Brighton manager, with the help of his coaching staff, also interacted with fourth official Sam Allison throughout the game.\nMatch report\nMichael Emons at Portman Road: Ipswich's Kieran McKenna paced along the edge of the technical area, encouraging and clapping his side - calm and steady instead of panicking and nervous.\nHe was a near-permanent presence there, but when something happened - goals at either end, corners, good challenges, shots - he would watch the clip with the analysts for 10-20 seconds before returning to his position.\nA raised fist followed Liam Delap's goal, but McKenna - 40 seconds late for the start of the second half - was dejected after Wolves' late winner.\nWolves manager Vitor Pereira - watching from media seats - and assistant Luis Miguel were suspended, so first-team coach Andre Monteiro took charge.\nAfter Ipswich scored, Monteiro was a chalk-on-the-trainers boss, almost on the pitch, a few paces out of the area. On a few occasions the fourth official had to politely tell Monteiro to get back.\nMonteiro was constantly in touch with Pereira, looking in his direction, making hand signals while talking via an earpiece.\nWhen Wolves equalised, Monteiro was about to bring on striker Hwang Hee-chan, but after some hand waving in Pereira's direction, the decision was changed. Wolves' winner left Pereira hugging his coaching staff, with Premier League safety practically secured.\nMatch report\nEmma Smith at London Stadium: West Ham manager Graham Potter was continuously standing on the edge of his technical area, arms folded and observing the game for the most part, while two members of his staff - assistant manager Bruno and first-team coach Narcis Pelach - were up and down from the bench.\nIt was the coaches who interacted with the fourth official rather than the manager, and calling subs over from their warm-up. Pelach was usually alongside Potter when West Ham had an attacking free-kick.\nPotter and Bruno were often in conversation after key moments and before any tactical changes.\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola was much more excitable - almost on the pitch as he issued instructions to his players.\nThis was particularly prevalent early on, though in the second half he spent more time on the bench conversing with staff as the flow of the game changed. He would also take a much more direct role in interacting with his players - both on the pitch and with the subs - than Potter.\nMatch report\nAndrew Bassett at Villa Park: Unai Emery and Nuno Espirito Santo spent the majority of the match in front, rather than within, their technical areas.\nEmery energetically directed his team, frequently moving up and down the sideline, while Nuno stood unmoved with arms folded.\nTheir communication styles with their teams were different too. Emery directed his team, often gesticulating to up the tempo. One moment stood out - when he crouched down to excitably stress a point to substitute Boubacar Kamara as he was coming on.\nFor Forest, Nuno's assistant Rui Silva was more likely to interact with players during the match - shouting instructions and briefing oncoming substitutes. It was notable that Villa coach Austin MacPhee would jump up from the bench to coach most set-pieces, including some attacking throw-ins.\nMatch report\nAdam Millington at Gtech Community Stadium: Coaching on a matchday is a team affair for Thomas Frank. He has no qualms with stepping back to analyse the game and allowing the rest of his backroom team to deputise.\nFrank constantly shifted back to the bench with his notepad in hand to speak to colleagues before stepping back to convey information to the players on the pitch.\nHe seemed to prefer the slightly higher vantage point from the bench. It also gave him the ability to intently watch replays of what was happening on the pitch, assess the game in real time and make any needed adjustments.\nEnzo Maresca, however, was the polar opposite. He rarely retreated to the bench, instead spending the game pacing up and down - and often outside of - his dugout.\nMaresca was regularly animated, shouting instructions towards his players and running backwards and forwards. Frank, meanwhile, was quiet and pensive in his technical area.\nMatch report\nEmma Smith at Craven Cottage: Both managers generally stood alone at the edge of their technical areas, and were the ones to issue instructions to their players.\nMarco Silva was not shy of expressing his views to the officials - he flew into a rage at Fulham not being awarded an early penalty, while referee Chris Kavanagh had to come over for a word after Silva felt Rodrigo Muniz was fouled. \nSilva would occasionally sit down and speak to coaches, but he was usually found pacing the length of his technical area shouting instructions to players.\nArne Slot also stood throughout most of the game, although as more of a watching brief; he would turn to coaches to express thoughts after key moments.\nHis longest period sitting down came after Liverpool went 3-1 behind, when he looked furious and exasperated. After all five goals, Slot spoke to various players in his team - such as Curtis Jones, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota - to issue instructions.\nMatch report\nMichael Emons at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium: Two very contrasting styles. Tottenham's Ange Postecoglou was calm throughout - he would pick a spot on the edge of his box and stay there for a few minutes. There was hardly any shouting, just the occasional gesture of frustration when a pass was misplaced.\nThe most animated he became, maybe predictably, was when VAR got involved for a decision to wipe out a second Spurs goal that took four minutes to conclude. That was the only time he moved for any length of time, as his frustration grew.\nAt one stage in the delay he appeared to play a rock, paper, scissors game - highlighting the unpredictable, random nature of VAR decisions.\nSouthampton's Ivan Juric could not stop moving, constantly pacing up and down the line. There were only 47 seconds on the clock when he was told by fourth official Sam Barrott to get back in the area.\nJuric treated the technical area as optional, spending more time out of it than in, often crouching down, repeatedly shouting instructions but all to no avail as the Saints were relegated to the Championship. Juric left the club the following day.\nMatch report\nJoe Bradshaw at Old Trafford: United boss Ruben Amorim bounced between standing on the balls of his feet like a coiled spring and relentlessly pacing his technical area, constantly barking out instructions and only pausing to drink from his bottle or usher coach Carlos Fernandes forward for both attacking and defensive set-pieces. \nThose were the only times he disappeared from the touchline, directing his players through almost every other element of the performance.\nWhile less frenetic on his feet, counterpart Pep Guardiola was equally active - arms thrown wide, head bowed in frustration or whirling his hands to demand more from his players.\nWhen United attacked, Guardiola regularly dropped to his haunches. Occasionally he would return to the dugout to swap thoughts with assistant Juan Manuel Lillo, but barely lasted a minute before coming to the side of the pitch again\nThere was one nice moment when Guardiola showed a delicate touch to control a ball out of play, and Amorim touched his hand as a sign of commendation. From one cultured footballer to another, their mutual respect was also obvious in their embrace at the end.\nMatch report\nMichael Emons at King Power Stadium: Eddie Howe was the main figure of course, but Newcastle assistant Jason Tindall also played a part. Whenever Howe was talking to his players at a set piece or to the substitutes waiting to come on, Tindall would move into position so there was almost always one of them at the front of the area.\nHowe was also in constant talks with Tindall at the back of the technical area or writing notes down in his notebook. When the second goal went in, Howe immediately called over Joelinton for a tactical chat, and he did similar with a number of other players when the third went in, despite the big lead.\nRuud van Nistelrooy had his head in his hands after the visitors scored after a couple of minutes and was noticeably getting more and more frustrated at his side's inability to keep the ball as sloppy mistakes became more frequent.\nHe spent most of the opening half hour on the edge of the technical area, but after Newcastle's third goal, he watched the rest of the half from his seat. He did return to the edge of the technical area for most of the second half though, with most of the home fans leaving well before the end.\nMatch report\nAll graphics and imagery for this project were designed by Lee Martin.",

        "article_text": "Markets are reeling from US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, but the American leader is standing by his decisions, defending his policies and saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\". \nExperts answered some of the questions you sent us as the world tries to make sense of the turmoil and wonders how long it will continue.\nRead their answers below.\nSimon Jack, the BBC's business editor, said the FTSE 100, which represents the 100 biggest companies publicly listed in the UK, were all \"put in a big bucket back in 1984\" and given a certain weighting in that bucket depending on how big those companies were. \nThe stock market is a reflection of their total value over time. The bigger the company, the more weight it has in the index. For example, an AstraZeneca or an HSBC has more weight than others.\nIt works the same in the US with the S&P500, which is made up of the 500 biggest companies, with an enormous concentration in some names like Apple, Nvidia and Amazon. \nThe stock market tells you how the value of the shares in those companies has changed - with a focus on those biggest names.\nGenerally speaking, it is an indication of what some of our biggest companies are worth, and when they go up or down, it tells you something about the sentiment of whether their profits are likely to rise or fall in the future.\nJack explains that what happens in stock markets is not necessarily the same thing that happens in the economy. They can be linked, but they are not exactly the same. \nSome people invest directly in shares - and this will definitely affect them. These are some big falls, some of the biggest we have seen in a couple days since pandemic panic gripped the markets back in 2020.\nThe other way that people are exposed to these changes is through their pension funds. Pension fund investing is a long term game. Not all of your money will go into shares - some will go into government bonds, and the closer you get to retirement, the more weighting you will have in things like cash and government bonds, so the less this will affect you. \nThere are two types of pensions: a defined benefit pension - where you get a promised percentage of your salary at retirement - and defined contribution - where your pension pots value will rise and fall with financial markets.\nPensions are exposed right now, but pension investing is a long term game. \nThe warning sign flashing here is not the value of your pension pot - it is what is going to happen to the economies in which we all live and work.\nA lot of people are saying the chance of recession in both the US, UK - and even globally - have gone up a notch, which has implications for things like jobs and wages.\nThere is growing scepticism about tariffs among Americans, although views still fall along partisan lines.\nAccording to one poll released last week, slightly more than half of Republicans, 52%, think tariffs help the economy, but 58% of independents say they hurt the economy, as do 89% of Democrats. \nHowever, that survey was held before Trump's global tariffs came into effect and trillions of dollars was wiped off the value of the US stock market. We will find out in the coming days how the economic turmoil has changed public sentiment. \nOne of the key factors in President Trump's 2024 election victory was that more voters trusted him to improve the US economy, and especially to tackle high prices.\nYet most economists warn that tariffs could drive up prices for US consumers as almost all imported goods will face a tax. \nThere could be inflation and we could also see an economic downturn, and potentially a recession.\nSome think that the whole exercise is about an economic proxy war with China and the entire game is about just trying to level that playing field a little bit, Jack said.\nBut Trump is right in one regard, which is that American markets are much more open to foreign goods than a lot of foreign markets are open to US goods. \nThe UK, for example, puts a 10% tariff on US imported cars, 14% on some kinds of beef, and 8% on other things. So there are barriers both ways. \nAnd while Trump says that other countries have been ripping off the US, it is American corporations that have reasonably pursued shareholder value by trying to put their production facilities in the strategically and economically best places.\nIt is the head of American corporations who opened subsidiaries in Ireland, where there is a low tax rate, and put manufacturing in Vietnam or Cambodia. In a way this has been the sort of rational pursuit of maximum profit, a system which has made the US very rich indeed.\nChina is getting very rich indeed as well, and it is certainly moving up the value chain. \nThere is a feeling that the US was very comfortable when China was making cheap sneakers and t-shirts, but when China starts making supercomputers and missiles the US gets a little bit more concerned, and that is one of the reasons you are seeing some of these tensions come to the fore.\nThat is really the unknown question right now, Davison said, but one thing we can expect is more volatility. \nWe got a little bit of a sense of how markets react on Friday when Trump said he had spoken with Vietnamese officials and there was potentially a deal in the works for Vietnam. \nThe country has been hit with a 46% tariff by the US, which is quite a significant level, and Vietnam has indicated that it could reduce to zero all its tariffs on US goods going into that country. Stocks like Nike and Lululemon actually increase on that news, because these are apparel companies that have a very big presence in Vietnam.\nBroadly, I believe we are going to see markets go down, but you could see particular stocks moving in a more positive direction as there are indications that there may be some exemptions allowed. \nWe do not know what Trump will allow - he has sent some big signals at times saying that his policies will never change, but has also suggested that some deals are possible.",

        "article_text": "Video games are the biggest form of entertainment in the world, but sometimes they bleed into people's lives offline in surprising and disturbing ways.\nChristian Dines' hands were twitching. As though he were still gripping his video game controller, about to make a killer move. But the game was switched off and his hands were free. The US-based sustainability advisor had also noticed how, when he glanced at objects in his room, he felt an urge to absorb or \"collect\" them, like weapons or power-ups in his game.\nHe swallowed hard. \"I thought, 'what the hell is this?' It was something I'd never experienced before as a gamer,\" he says. After a week of playing the same game maybe two or three hours a day, Dines' virtual experience was spilling over, disturbingly, into reality.\u00a0\n\"It all only lasted a couple of days, but the effect was disorientating,\" he recalls. \"It's unnerving to be distracted in some way by a screen when you're no longer in front of it.\"\nDines had, it seems, experienced something called Game Transfer Phenomenon, a condition in which the physical world and video games bleed together. While this might not be very common, for gamers who experience it, the condition can be extremely unsettling. And potentially even dangerous.\nThe term Game Transfer Phenomenon, or GTP, was first coined by Angelica Ortiz de Gortari, a psychologist at the University of Bergen in Norway. She first proposed the concept a decade ago while working on her doctoral thesis under the supervision of Mark Griffiths, head of Nottingham Trent University's International Gaming Research Unit. Ortiz de Gortari was motivated by her own experience of GTP. One day, she was walking around her local supermarket and realised that she was imagining peering at products on the shelves through a rifle scope.\n\"I thought, 'Wow! This is interesting',\" she recalls. \"A phenomenon that changes your perception by encouraging you to see objects through the lens of the game you're playing,\" she says, adding that her response had felt involuntary, leaving her with serious questions about what it meant.\nBut what exactly is GTP? Ortiz de Gortari suggests that one could compare it to potentially more common experiences such as ear-worms, in which you spend days trying to get a catchy song out of your head. Or when images from a television show you binge-watched keep popping up in your mind's eye. With GTP, though, the intensity is arguably dialled up, says Ortiz de Gortari. Not least because gaming activates brain areas associated with control inhibition \u2013 the ability, or not, to control one's thoughts and behaviour rather than acting on impulse. This can also occur while passively watching television, but to a lesser degree than while gaming.\nOrtiz de Gortari's studies suggest that GTP induces distress and dysfunction for around half of those gamers who say they have experienced it, with confusion, hyper-vigilance and irrationality among the symptoms. For others the only notable response may be a feeling of embarrassment that their game-play has spilled over into \"real life\".\nOne study participant she interviewed reported seeing health indicator bars like those in the role-playing game World of Warcraft floating above their companions' heads. Another spoke of lapses in concentration after not being able to stop \"seeing\" images from a game. Others said colours in the real world seemed transformed, and began to mimic the colours of a game world they had recently played in. While such effects are usually transitory, GTP can provoke a startling array of spontaneous or involuntary effects, according to Ortiz de Gortari's research.\nWhile rare, these effects can even take the form of involuntary physical actions and behaviours. A game could end up shaping the way one interacts with real world objects or people. For example, a walk down a supermarket aisle could be experienced through the lens of gameplay, with the player perhaps \"shooting\" at products or people, possibly with a corresponding involuntary physical action in the hands as though working console controls.\nIn total, Ortiz de Gortari has recorded GTP experiences among gamers related to more than 400 titles of all kinds. Her largest on the subject to date, published in 2024, involved the participation of 623 Chinese gamers, both male and female. The results suggest that between 82% and 96% of those gamers have experienced some form of GTP.\u00a0\nIt's possible that some gamers might have endured episodes of GTP but never admitted this to anyone, for fear of being considered \"crazy\", says Ortiz de Gortari. It is time we demystified GTP, she argues. \"The mission for me is to inform people about the phenomenon, to raise awareness, because the [gamers] I've spoken to about it have been very concerned,\" she says. \"Often, people don't want to talk about the experience of, say, seeing things that aren't there with their open eyes \u2013 even if that's what happens \u2013 because that's to talk about hallucinations, and they're associated with [potentially taboo, severe] mental illness.\"\nOrtiz de Gortari argues that GTP has become a more common experience as games, especially role-playing, simulation, adventure and first-person shooter games, have become increasingly realistic and immersive. They offer sprawling environments full of detail and interaction. Essentially, gamers end up living virtual lives through such media and can find the gameplay deeply affecting.\n\"The more realistic the video game world is, the more likely players are to confuse the game world and the real world,\" says Ortiz de Gortari, who adds that this could mean GTP is becoming more common and impactful. The sophistication of games has undoubtedly increased since the days of Tetris and Super Mario, she points out. \"Essentially the sophistication of the game facilitates the experience outside of the game.\"\nAli Farha, a gaming industry commentator and senior game producer at Stockholm-based Star Stable Entertainment, has experienced GTP himself. He describes his case as \"a pretty harmless sense of gameplay repeating offline\". He suggests that regular breaks during extended stretches of play and a period of conscious decompression after a long gaming session \u2013 reading a book or watching some light TV \u2013 could help counteract the likelihood of GTP raising its head.\nPlaying time \u2013 particularly above four hours \u2013 does appear to be a key factor in the onset of GTP. That's one reason why Scott Jennings, spokesperson for the US-based Gaming Addicts Anonymous (GAA), whose members invariably are at the high-end of playing hours, says the support group is increasingly mindful of this potential side-effect of gaming.\u00a0\nFarha also says that few people currently appreciate that, as he believes, the bridge between the real and the virtual is actually a two-way street.\u00a0\n\"We overlook that we also take the experiences and expectations of the real world into the game world \u2013 and that too can be disorientating,\" he says. \"I think it's quite common to enter a multi-player online game and feel loneliness, for example, even though you know you're at home. The experiences we have online become part of our personality. We build memories inside the virtual space of the games we play too, in the same way we build memories in the real world.\" In fact, studies suggest that games can be more conducive to memory formation than real life.\n\"I think for a lot of players the virtual and real worlds are starting to blur,\" Farha adds.\nWhile no-one has reported physical harm as a consequence of GTP to date reported to date \u2013 GTP could, in principle, endanger someone. \"It's not a good idea for me to be trying to kill demons while I'm driving,\" as Dines puts it.\nExactly why the virtual world can blur with the real world in this way, however, is still not clear. Some studies suggest different brain networks are activated when observing something in a virtual environment, compared to a real one. The same has been found with objects in augmented reality, where virtual elements are superimposed onto the real world. But some studies have shown that human memory can sometimes struggle to recall whether something occurred in a virtual environment or in real life \u2013 with the effects being more pronounced when using virtual reality systems.\nOrtiz de Gortari has indicated that GTP might be more common among gamers who have a tendency for mind-wandering and have a low working memory capacity. She also believes it could be the result of the game priming the brain or some sort of associated learning effect that when gamers encounter something similar to an environment or scene they came across in a game, it can trigger an involuntary response.\nBut these are all theories for now.\n\"The human brain isn't built to differentiate between reality and today's virtual worlds,\" says a spokesperson for Game Addicts Anonymous. \"That's one reason why games are so captivating and why it's no surprise the two experiences overlap.\"\nJennings also recounts a GTP-like experience. After playing an aggressive racing game he later felt \"a disconcerting urge\" when out driving, to smash into a vehicle that pulled up alongside him. He argues that GTP could be compared to alcoholism. It's not necessarily about how many drinks you've had but rather it's about your personal relationship to alcohol. Similarly, he says, while most people may have a functional relationship to gaming, some players are less able to contain its effect to playing time.\nRecent research by Ortiz de Gortari would appear to back this up. Her findings suggests that certain personality traits are likely a factor in one's propensity towards GTP. Other influences she cites include suffering from sleep deprivation, stress, depression or anxiety.\nMax Dzmitryiev, a US-based counsellor and gamer, says he grew up experiencing symptoms of anxiety. Video games, he says, offered an escape from reality.\u00a0\n\"But I'd easily get immersed in them,\" he recalls. \"And as the level of immersion grew, so the stimulation was higher and so I had more GTP experiences,\" he says. To him, GTP is \"freaky and unpleasant\" and something that can overwhelm his thoughts and decisions for as long as 20 minutes. After such a bout, GTP can keep popping up for days, intermittently, he explains.\nDzmitryiev has even noticed that watching someone else play a game can induce GTP-style effects. He gives the example of observing someone having fun in Minecraft, a colourful exploration and world-building game. Watching the other person's progress intently can lead to Dzmitryiev to, he says, literally perceiving his own surroundings as though they were built from the cube-like blocks used to construct the virtual environments in Minecraft. This effect \u2013 like an involuntary visual overlay to his surroundings \u2013 can last for an hour or so, he says. \"It's why I tend to stay away from VR games now \u2013 because I still feel fully immersed for too long after taking the headset off,\" he says.\nIt raises questions about whether the games industry should be addressing GTP in some way? Since so many games are played by children and young people, Ortiz de Ortiz de Gortari argues that developers should take more responsibility in addressing the potential impact of GTP on susceptible gamers, possibly through their own research, or at least by acknowledging its effects.\nDines says that he would endorse some kind of warning on games. It may only have relevance for a few gamers but that's no different to the warnings about strobe lighting effects, which could induce epileptic seizures in a small subset of players, for example.\n\"Game developers intentionally craft their products to give certain experiences \u2013 they know their game's power,\" says Farha. \"Players need to appreciate that games have to be used correctly. I know I've played too much at times and it didn't make me feel good.\"\nBut Nick Ballou, a postdocoral researcher in video games and mental health at the University of Oxford, expresses concern that overemphasising the dangers of GTP will fuel the moral panic around video games or stoke fears that all games are inherently unhealthy. Ballou is currently in the process of analysing data shared with him by the gaming industry. This data covers five leading video game platforms and his goal is to provide the most nuanced picture to date of how games affect people, both for better or worse. He aims to publish the first research from this project this spring.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why children love Minecraft so much\n\u2022 The mysterious origins of an uncrackable video game\n\u2022 The people who 'see' foreign languages\nMost gamers don't find that their hobby impacts their mental health negatively, he says. Rather, they more commonly report that gaming induces feelings of relief or relaxation, and that it gives them access to communities or offers a sense of achievement and identity. \"Any problems are at the extremes [of gaming],\" says Ballou. \"[Similarly], in small doses, GTP doesn't strike me as particularly problematic. If it was endemic we'd see more people out there behaving in very strange ways. But we don't.\"\nFor Ortiz de Gortari, however, there's a lot still to uncover about this extraordinary phenomenon. We still know relatively little about the way gamers unconsciously process what they see and hear during play. A better understanding of this, through a complex and expensive brain scan study, might, she says, help us unravel what happens as GTP kicks in.\u00a0\n\"We have enough evidence that GTP is happening,\" she says. \"Now we need to more about know how and why.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "More than 40 percent of the world's electricity was generated without burning fossil fuels in 2024, according to a new report from think-tank Ember.\nBut carbon dioxide emissions, which warm the planet, have risen to an all time high, the report says, with hot weather pushing up the overall demand for power.\nThat meant an increase in the use of fossil fuel burning power stations.\nSolar power continues to be the fastest-growing energy source, with the amount of electricity it generates doubling in the last three years.\n\"Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition,\" said Phil Macdonald, the managing director of Ember. \n\"Amid the noise, it's essential to focus on the real signal. Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"\nIn a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.\nEmber is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling. \nBut this hasn't happened yet due to increasing global demand for electricity. \nCheap and relatively easy to install, for the twentieth year in a row solar is the fastest growing electricity source. According to Ember, the amount generated by solar panels has doubled every three years since 2012.\nChina continues to dominate the growth of solar with more than half of the increase taking place there. India's solar capacity doubled between 2023 and 2024.\nThough it is growing fast, solar remains a relatively small part of the global energy mix contributing just under 7% of global supply \u2013 that's the same as powering the entire country of India. \nWind contributes just over 8%, with hydropower contributing 14% making it the largest source of clean energy. Both hydro-electric and nuclear power (9%) are growing much more slowly than wind and solar.\nThe report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.\nThe big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy. \nThat means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.\nAccording to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024. \nThis was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.\nIn the last five years, fast-growing Asian economies, in particular India and China, have continued expanding their use of fossil fuels to meet rapidly rising demand for electricity.

He wants people to know that he's edgy and dark and I'm, I don't know, like I watch reality TV.\"\nWhite continued: \"We never really even fought. He says we feuded.

Which is also why I'm not returning.\"\nDe Veer won three Emmy Awards for The White Lotus, including outstanding theme for season one.\nSome fans expressed disappointment that the show's theme changed for season three, losing its famous \"ooh-loo-loo-loo\" vocal hook.\nDe Veer said he tried to persuade producers to release a full version of the season three theme including the vocals, but said White refused.\nWhite told Stern: \"By the time the third season came around, he'd won Emmys and he had his song go viral, he didn't want to go through the process with me, he didn't want to go to sessions.\n\"He would always look at me with this contemptuous smirk on his face like he thought I was a chimp or something... he's definitely making a big deal out of a creative difference.\"\nIn response, De Veer drew attention to the career he had \"long before the White Lotus\", which saw him win other awards including a Bafta and a Royal Television Society Award. \nIn his original comments to the New York Times, De Veer said: \"Maybe I was being unprofessional, and for sure Mike feels that I was always unprofessional to him because I didn't give him what he wanted.\"\nThe third season of The White Lotus, which is set in wealthy hotels and focuses on rich guests and the staff who serve them, received mixed reviews from critics.\nThe Guardian described the finale as \"the show's least satisfying ending ever\" in a three-star review. The Independent agreed it was a \"a violent end to a bad season\", while the Standard said it was \"heartwarming, frequently heartbreaking and, often, frustrating\".\nThe Telegraph was more positive, awarding the last episode four stars and describing it as \"a dark, uncomfortable finale, but one that forced the audience to ponder the very meaning of happiness\".\nThe latest season starred British actors Jason Isaacs and Aimee Lou Wood alongside Walton Goggins, Leslie Bibb, Carrie Coon, Michelle Monaghan and Parker Posey. \nSunday's final episode was watched by 6.2 million viewers in the US. \nIn the UK, the show has been attracting about 1.5 million viewers per episode, including catch-up.\nIt has also received huge pick-up on social media, with some scenes being made into memes and gifs, while fans have speculated on relationships between cast members.",

called the Professional Rugby Agreement (PRA) - as part of the \"One Wales\" strategy through until 2029.\nThe premise is based on the four regions -  Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets - being functioning independent businesses with private investment.\nCardiff are currently ninth in the United Rugby Championship table\nThe investment of Helford Capital Limited in Cardiff Rugby was led by British businessmen Phil Kempe and Neal Griffith, who are on the region's board.\nKempe is a Welshman with an association stretching back more than a decade with the club. \nCardiff said at the time that Kempe had a range of successful business interests across multiple industries in the UK, Canada and the Middle East.\nGriffith, who also has Welsh roots, is a former investment banker with numerous global business interests as an investor and director.\nThe duo had significant business relationships in the United Arab Emirates, which they said they planned to leverage for Cardiff's benefit.\nThe takeover followed the death of former chairman and benefactor Peter Thomas in March 2023.\nThe deal secured the minor stake of the Thomas family and other significant shareholders.\nThe takeover was approved by a \"99.99% majority\" at Cardiff's general meeting.\nThe investment group gained approval from the Cardiff board, the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club, which retained a minority shareholding in the club.\nThe due diligence test was undertaken by an independent London-based company.\nCardiff Rugby chair Alun Jones said the takeover would \"represent a huge moment in the history of Cardiff Rugby and gives us a bright, secure and exciting future\".\nCardiff is regarded as one of the grand club names in world rugby. \nGreats of the game including Cliff Morgan, Bleddyn Williams, Sir Gareth Edwards, Barry John, Terry Holmes, John Scott, Neil Jenkins, Jonah Lomu, Gethin Jenkins and Sam Warburton have all worn the Cardiff shirt in different guises.\nCardiff Rugby were formed in 1876 following an amalgamation between Cardiff Wanderers and the Glamorgan Football Club and the first game took place on December 2, 1876, against Newport RFC.\nThe Blue & Blacks became universally acknowledged as one of the world's most famous and successful sides.\nPlaying at Cardiff Arms Park, they claimed victories over major touring teams, including Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and achieved numerous national honours.\nWith the advent of regional rugby in 2003, Cardiff was granted its own standalone professional team. \nThey initially played under the Cardiff Blues brand, with a semi-professional Cardiff RFC side beneath them playing in the Welsh Premiership.\nThe region originally encompassed Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan but following the demise of the Celtic Warriors in 2004, Cardiff club took on responsibility for a wider area that included Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr and Powys.\nCardiff dropped the 'Blues' title in 2021 when they were rebranded as Cardiff Rugby. \nIn the regional era, Cardiff have won the European Challenge Cup twice in 2010 and 2018.\nIf the WRU takes over in the short term it could be searching for new long-term investors.\nThe union could consider taking over permanent ownership of the side but that is something it has attempted to avoid in the past, highlighted by the return of  Dragons to private ownership in 2023.\nIt is set to be business as usual with Cardiff having four United Rugby Championship (URC) games left this season, which will be fulfilled with Matt Sherratt's side still having hopes of finishing in the top eight and qualifying for the play-offs. \nTheir next fixture is against Ospreys on Saturday, 19 April at the Principality Stadium. They are then scheduled to host Munster at the Arms Park six days later.\nIt is understood the plan is to honour contracts and the new signings who have been announced by Cardiff should join up with the squad in the summer.\nUnlike football, there are understood to be no automatic points deduction from the URC if a team goes into administration.\nThe state of rugby finances is under the microscope with London Irish, Wasps and Worcester having all gone out of business during the 2022-23 season, leaving the top flight of English rugby with only 10 teams.\nIn Wales in 2003, five professional regions were created from the club game before Celtic Warriors were disbanded in 2004.\nIn 2017, the WRU stepped in to be the majority stakeholder at Dragons following financial difficulties. The Newport-based side were eventually returned to private investment in 2023.\nIn March 2024, Cardiff announced a loss of \u00a32.1m for the year ending June 2023, with the next set of accounts due in May 2025.\nBoth Ospreys and Scarlets have recently announced losses of more than \u00a32m for the year ending June 2024.\nThe current budgets for the four Welsh professional sides is \u00a34.5m. That is planned to rise to \u00a35.1m and then to more than \u00a36m in the coming seasons.",

They initially played under the Cardiff Blues brand, with a semi-professional Cardiff RFC side beneath them playing in the Welsh Premiership.The region originally encompassed Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan but following the demise of the Celtic Warriors in 2004, Cardiff club took on responsibility for a wider area that included Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr and Powys.Cardiff dropped the 'Blues' title in 2021 when they were rebranded as Cardiff Rugby.",

        "article_text": "It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.\nHong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.\nSo when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note. \nHong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operation, sometime in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.\nThe project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains. \n\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.\nThe Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.\nTo spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India. \nUnder those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.\n\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert. \nBut many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands. \nServing them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector. \nTheir affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market. \nAshok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra. \n\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.\n\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"\nSo how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?\n\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma. \n\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.\n\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"\nMaking the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands. \nWhile popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.\nMeanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.\nSabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.\nMr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative. \n\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.\n\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"\nComet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.\nIt claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.\n\"This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,\" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.\nHe says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.\n\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.\nChange is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"\n\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds. \nBack in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.\n\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"\nBut Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.\n\"The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.\n\"But I don't think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche.\"",

Some can't say the same.\"\nChelsea's Sanchez among world's best keepers, says data\nCameroon international Onana's initial comments came after Sunday's 0-0 draw against Manchester City, when he was confident despite describing Lyon as a \"very good team\".\n\"Of course, it's not going to be easy but I think we are way better than them,\" Onana said.\n\"We all know the importance of this game, we will go there with the winning mentality. It's not our best season but we still have something to win and we will go for it.\"\nOnana did not make a list of the top goalkeepers in the world, published on Wednesday by the CIES Football Observatory Index.\nCIES uses methodology to take into account the level of games played, the results of matches, and the deviation in the percentage of saves at domestic league level compared to the expected value.\nThe top three were Paris St-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma, Inter Milan's Yann Sommer and Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois.\nThe first leg of the Europa League quarter-final takes place in Lyon at 20:00 BST. \nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

Only authorised persons can go in close proximity to them to perform a specific task,\" Mr Sharma said.\nInitial reports in the media called the video \"heartwarming\" but many on social media raised concerns about the safety of people and animals in such situations. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.\nVillages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Last month, some villagers pelted the cats with stones to stop such attacks, The New Indian Express newspaper reported. Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.\nTwenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\nEight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. \nIn 2023, South African and Namibian experts involved with the project wrote to India's Supreme Court, saying they believed that some of these deaths could have been prevented by \"better monitoring of animals and more appropriate and timely veterinary care\". \nExperts from the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which has been involved with the project since its inception, had also raised concerns about inadequate record-keeping at Kuno. They told the BBC that the park management had \"little or no scientific training\" and the vets were \"too inexperienced to manage a project of this calibre\".\nPark authorities have rejected the allegations and say there are now a total of 26 cheetahs, including 17 in the wild and nine others that are kept in enclosures at the moment.\nThis year, India is expected to receive 20 more cheetahs from South Africa. Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Constructed by a mysterious civilisation that left no written records, the massive site is now open to the public for the first time in more than a century.\nAutumn leaves crackled under our shoes as dozens of eager tourists and I followed a guide along a grassy mound. We stopped when we reached the opening of a turf-topped circle, which was formed by another wall of mounded earth. We were at The Octagon, part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, a large network of hand-constructed hills spread throughout central and southern Ohio that were built as many as 2,000 years ago. Indigenous people would come to The Octagon from hundreds of miles away, gathering regularly for shared rituals and worship.\u00a0\n\"There was a sweat lodge or some kind of purification place there,\" said our guide, Brad Lepper, senior archaeologist for the Ohio History Connection's World Heritage Program (OHC), as he pointed to the circle. I looked inside to see a perfectly manicured lawn \u2013 a putting green. A tall flag marked a hole at its centre.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat's because from 1910 through 2024, The Octagon had been used as a golf course. But on 1 January 2025, this ancient, enigmatic site reopened to visitors for the first time in more than a century.\nAll these prehistoric ceremonial earthworks in Ohio were created by what is now called the Hopewell Culture, a network of Native American societies that gathered from as far away as Montana and the Gulf of Mexico between roughly 100 BCE and 500 CE and were connected by a series of trade routes. Their earthworks in Ohio consist of shapes \u2013 like circles, squares and octagons \u2013 that were often connected to each other. Archaeologists are only now beginning to understand the sophistication of these engineering marvels.\nBuilt with astonishing mathematical precision, as well as a complex astronomical alignment, these are the largest geometrical earthworks in the world that were not built as fortifications or defensive structures. And while most people have never heard about the sites or its builders, that may be about to change.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nIn 2023, eight of Hopewell's earthworks were inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage site. These include The Great Circle and The Octagon in Newark, Ohio, as well Ohio's first state park, Fort Ancient (not an actual fort). The other five are part of the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park: Mound City, Hopeton Earthworks, High Bank Works, Hopewell Mound Group and Seip Earthworks.\u00a0\nLepper told me The Octagon and The Great Circle were once a larger, single Hopewell complex spanning 4.5 square miles and connected by a series of roads lined by earthwork walls. Walking through both sites today, there is an immediate shock of scale. The Great Circle, where the museum for Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks is found, is 1,200ft in diameter. Its walls rise up to 14ft high and are outlined on the inside by a deep ditch. The Great Circle was once connected to a square and a burial ellipse, with only part of the square still visible today.\u00a0The Octagon sprawls a massive 50 acres and is attached to the 20-acre Observatory Circle, a large earthwork circle for gathering and rituals connected to the observation of the night sky.\n\"You could put four Roman Colosseums inside just The Octagon,\" Lepper told me. \"Stonehenge would fit within just that small circle now serving as a putting green.\" He added that 2,000 years ago, Indigenous workers built these earthworks without modern tools, digging up soil with pointed sticks and hauling it in wicker baskets on their backs. One estimate, he noted, is that they moved seven million cubic feet of dirt.\u00a0\nThe achievement of the Hopewell Culture, however, is not simply in creating large, precise shapes, which they did without the vantage point of hills for an aerial view. They also embedded a sort of hidden geometry within these structures. Until the mounds were measured and compared, it was thought that the builders didn't have any mathematical and geometrical sophistication, as there are no written records to testify to their level of knowledge. It was eventually discovered, however, that they made precise measurements across their earthworks and connected them in unsuspecting ways.\u00a0\nLepper explained that the circumference of The Great Circle \"is equal to the perimeter of the perfect square that it was connected to\", and that \"the area of that perfect square is equal to the area of the [Observatory Circle] that's connected to The Octagon\".\u00a0\nHe added: \"If you draw a square inside The Octagon by drawing a line from alternate corners of The Octagon, the sides of that square [1,054ft] are equal to the diameter of the circle that it's attached to [1,054ft].\"\nExamples of this interplay between earthworks have been found repeatedly by archaeologists. According to Lepper, that measure of 1054ft, whether halved or doubled, is found in other Indigenous earthworks across the country, and served as a common unit of measure.\u00a0\nWhile the Hopewell Culture's geometrical and mathematical knowledge astonished scholars, another level of sophistication appears when the layers are peeled back further: astronomical alignment.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The US's lost, ancient megacity\n\u2022 A mysterious US desert civilisation\n\u2022 A long-lost Maya city that was just discovered\nIn the 1980s, two professors at Earlham College in Indiana, Ray Hively (a physicist and astronomer) and Robert Horn (a philosopher), decided to pay a visit to The Octagon and its attached Observatory Circle. As astronomical monuments like Stonehenge had received great attention, they wondered if these earthworks were also aligned to a solar calendar.\u00a0\u00a0\nHively and Horn found no solar connections, but they then considered an alternative purpose: the lunar cycle.\n\"We thought deliberate lunar alignments unlikely at Newark,\" they wrote, because while the Sun can be tracked over a year, a complete lunar cycle takes 18.6 years. Even so, the lunar cycle proved to correspond to the position of the Observatory Mound at The Observatory Circle. There, one can watch the Moon rise over the exact centre of The Octagon in the distance every 18.6 years.\u00a0\n\"Astronomical alignments are only relevant and useful if they somehow tie the celestial orbs to belief systems and understandings of life,\" said Timothy Darvill, professor of archaeology at Bournemouth University who has researched both Stonehenge and the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks. \"The ceremonies around the observation of the skyscape could well have a secondary function in terms of fostering community.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThat ancient community and culture was part of the reason for its Unesco World Heritage Site inclusion.\u00a0\nA Unesco site needs to show that it has \"outstanding universal value\", said Jennifer Aultman, director of historic sites and museums at Ohio History Connection which helped lead its Unesco consideration. One criterion for this, she said, \"is that these are masterpieces of human creative genius\", which is where these mathematical, geometrical and astronomical features are important. The other, \"is that they bear really exceptional testimony to the cultural tradition that produced them\".\nAultman explained: \"You really can understand something about the lives of the people and what mattered to them by looking at, and learning about, the earthworks.\"\u00a0\nConsider the Moon, for example, which was clearly important for the Hopewell Culture. Darvill told me that, for some cultures, the \"Sun, Moon... are considered to have power over what happens on a day-to-day basis. As such, the heavenly bodies are often deified, which is how their power is justified and rationalised.\" It is therefore likely that the Moon was a deity shared by those who gathered at the mounds.\u00a0\n\"The land we know as Ohio is home to a number of extraordinary earthworks built by Indigenous residents of this region thousands of years ago,\" said Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of the Ohio History Connection. While not all earthworks in Ohio are specifically Hopewell Mounds \u2013 such as the solar-aligned Serpent Mound Historical Site in Peebles, Ohio, for example \u2013 Wood sees them all as \"icons\" of Indigenous \"cultural achievements\".\u00a0\nSince the Hopewell Culture left no written records, only the earthworks and the few objects retrieved from them serve as their last cultural testimony. While archaeological excavations continue on some sites, objects like ritual smoking pipes and a small stone statue of a shaman wearing a bear skin and holding a human skull called \"the Shaman of Newark\" have been found. As these earthworks were gathering places and not villages, artefacts representing the locations from where these Indigenous peoples travelled have also been discovered, like effigy pipes, a copper head plate and an obsidian knife.\nHowever, after the Hopewell Culture gradually began to disappear starting around 500 CE, other Indigenous peoples stepped in to become caretakers of the land. One of those groups was the Shawnee Tribe, which called Ohio home before they were forcibly removed west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s.\u00a0\n\"We may not have been responsible for building or creating them, but I know that my ancestors lived there, and that my ancestors protected them and respected them,\" said Chief Glenna Wallace of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, who believes that other tribes should have a role in the future of protecting the Hopewell Earthworks and communicating their cultural importance.\u00a0\nFor years, The Octagon was under the control of the Moundbuilders Country Club. After more than a decade of negotiations, the OHC and the club finally reached a deal in 2024 to transfer the site's long-term lease to the historical society, paving the way for them to open the earthworks to visitors beginning this January.\nFor advocates of the site's preservation, the Unesco designation and opening of these mysterious mounds to the public offers a new chapter to educate visitors about Ohio's Native American history. It also means more Indigenous stakeholders, like the Shawnee, can tell that story from an Indigenous perspective for future generations.\u00a0\n\"I just want people to know about it,\" said Chief Wallace, \"I want people to be able to see it. I want people to be able to visit it and want people to realise that it is a cultural phenomenon. That it's priceless.\"\u00a0\nThis story was originally published in December 2022 and has been updated to reflect recent developments.\n---\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n\u00a0",

        "article_text": "It's having a moment with celebrities, fashionistas and Gen Z. But wearing any kind of fur, from vintage to synthetic, poses some difficult questions. Could a new plant-based faux fur be the way forward?\nFrom Tory Burch in New York and Simone Rocha in London, to Fendi in Milan and Miu Miu in Paris, fur dominated the autumn/winter 2025-26 catwalks. And celebrities matched the runways, with Hailey Bieber, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift and Rihanna all spending the start of the year wrapped up in faux and vintage fur coats.\nThe last time fur hit the headlines was in 2017, when Gucci pledged to go fur-free, influencing a host of designer brands to follow suit. The move was welcomed by animal rights campaigners, but what followed was the scaling of a new problem: much of the real fur has been replaced by synthetic alternatives that are derived from fossil fuels. Given the tensions around animal welfare and the environment, why is fur now firmly back in fashion?\nIt began in early 2024 with the arrival of the mob wife aesthetic, an ostentatious, glamorous response to the understated, minimalist trend that preceded it: stealth wealth. \"Reviving historical looks for contemporary wear is a natural part of the fashion cycle. It's escapism, and who doesn't want some of that?\" says Natascha Radclyffe-Thomas, associate professor, MBA fashion business and entrepreneurship, at Ravensbourne University, London. \"I was in the room when [former CEO] Marco Bizzarri announced Gucci would no longer use animal fur in its collections, and remember what an amazing shift this was for an Italian luxury brand where fur was such a prevalent material. But the topic of faux fur is such a tricky one, too.\"\nRadclyffe-Thomas adds that, since designer labels' decision to ban real fur from their collections, the faux-fur market has evolved from the early days of \"fun\" fur \u2013 low cost, often in bright colours that didn't attempt to imitate the real thing \u2013 to a new level of quality where most consumers wouldn't know the difference between real and fake.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe production of fossil fuel-based fabrics continues to rise globally, with polyester the most common, accounting for 57% of all fibre production. Even clothing made from recycled polyester is problematic because the model isn't circular. The vast majority is made using plastic bottles \u2013\u00a0 not old textiles \u2013 which means that it can't be recycled again, and will most likely end up in landfill at some point.\nOne way to keep faux fur out of landfill \u2013\u00a0 or delay its final destination \u2013 is to keep it in circulation. At fashion rental company By Rotation, the rental of faux fur and wool coats has been increasing since even before the recent catwalk shows. London label Charlotte Simone \u2013\u00a0 whose faux fur coats have been worn by Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa and Madonna \u2013 is the third most rented brand across coats and jackets. \"Higher quality, well-made faux fur, especially from designer brands, tends to last longer, meaning it's more likely to be passed down, resold or rented rather than discarded,\" By Rotation founder and CEO, Eshita Kabra-Davies, tells the BBC.\nThe global second hand clothing market is expected to reach $367bn by 2029, with a record number of shoppers having bought pre-loved clothes in 2024. This year, since the autumn/winter 2025-26 collections were shown, searches for both real and faux fur have spiked at rental platforms and online retailers.\u00a0\nHolly Watkins, owner of vintage boutique One Scoop Store in north London, says that in the past few years she has seen a considerable shift away from selling real fur to fake alternatives, in response to changing tastes and demands from her customers. \"I only sell real fur if it's a super-special vintage piece which I can't say no to, or has a detachable collar or trim,\" she tells the BBC. \"Personally, I don't have a problem with old [real] fur \u2013 it's better to prolong its life than send it to landfill. I have more of a problem with polyester, in that it will never biodegrade.\"\nBut from conversations with vintage dealers in west London\u00a0\u2013 home to the likes of Portobello market \u2013 Watkins says that many stores have never stopped selling real fur, both old and new, with younger shoppers helping to drive the trend.\u00a0\n\"Fashion turned on fur. Young customers want more\" was the headline of a recent Wall Street Journal article \u2013 and the consensus does seem to be that Gen Z is leading the revival of vintage fur. Madison Avenue Furs, the largest buyer of pre-owned fur in the US, reports a significant uplift in sales, particularly of pre-owned pieces. \"We saw college students coming in to buy fur, which we haven't seen in years,\" Larry Cowit, owner of Madison Avenue Furs, tells the BBC. \"The vintage furs against the new furs was a concern for many of the younger buyers and \u2013 ethically \u2013 they were comfortable with vintage.\"\nCustomers are buying vintage furs across the board, says Cowit, including mink, fox and beaver in oversized silhouettes \u2013 from the likes of Christian Dior, Fendi, Oscar de la Renta, Prada and YSL. \"Once these brands come in, they go rather quickly.\"\nOn the catwalks at the recent fashion weeks, much of the fur was faux, although among the headlines at Paris Fashion Week was a mink coat made from real vintage fur at Gabriela Hearst, a designer label that positions itself as \"luxury with a conscience\".\nAnimal rights campaigners don't accept the vintage argument. \"Regardless of when the damage was done, vintage fur remains clothing made from the skin of a needlessly killed and caged animal,\" says Emma H\u00e5kansson, founder of Collective Fashion Justice. \"It is an ongoing symbol of human supremacy over other animals, and we should not accept that in the 21st Century when we have myriad other options without animal exploitation, wildlife killing or factory farming.\"\nAmong the new-generation alternatives to fossil-fuel-made fur and real animal skin is Savian, a 100% plant-based fur made from nettle, flax and hemp sourced from Europe and produced in Italy. Developed by material science company BioFluff, Savian launched in the form of a longline coat by Stella McCartney during COP28 in November 2023, and was later used in 2024 by Danish fashion brand Ganni to create a collection of bags for Copenhagen Fashion Week.\n\"We are working with several fashion brands across the luxury, contemporary and accessible markets to develop materials that are suited to their needs,\" BioFluff co-founder Roni Gamzon tells the BBC, adding that cost remains a challenge to scaling up the adoption of new-gen materials. \"So many brands have built a reliance on low-cost synthetic materials manufactured at mass in the Far East, making it impossible for us to compete purely on pricing.\"\nBioFluff is part of La Maison des Startups, a programme from LVMH to help accelerate the implementation of new solutions within its portfolio of brands, which includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi and C\u00e9line. Conversely, LVMH also helps to fund The International Fur Federation, paying \u20ac300,000 ($318,000) for Furmark membership, a global certification and traceability system for real fur.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Ten items in your wardrobe is enough \u2013 here's why\n\u2022 The Indigenous-American supermodel bringing change\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\nThe argument that synthetic fur has a higher environmental impact than real fur is questioned by a 2013 scientific study, which compared the impact of natural mink fur coats against that of faux fur coats, and found that the production of natural mink fur had the highest climate impact.

        "article_text": "President Trump has been justifying his sweeping tariffs with a series of claims about how the US is the victim of \"unfair trade\".\nHe has imposed tariffs - or import taxes - on countries around the world, including a 125% rate on goods imported from China. In response, China is hiking its tariffs on American imports. \nSome of Trump's claims on trade are unsubstantiated or even false. BBC Verify has been taking a closer look.\n\"We're making a fortune with tariffs - $2bn a day\", Trump has said about his new tariff regime on Tuesday. \nBBC Verify cannot find any published figures which show this.\nThe US Treasury Department publishes a daily statement on how much money from customs duties goes to the federal government.\nData from 7 April - which includes the impact of some of Trump's earlier tariffs - amounted to $215m (\u00a3168m).\nThat figure is well short of Trump's claim.\nIt is possible that he has based it on forecasts for the year ahead.\nThe US imported $9bn (\u00a37bn) worth of goods per day last year.\nSome analysts have calculated that the average rate of Trump's tariffs (as of 2 April) is 22%. \nApplying this to these import figures would get you to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) a day.\nBut this calculation assumes that the volume of US imports would stay at this level. \nAnother way Trump could have reached his figure is by basing it on what his trade advisor said on 6 April. \nPeter Navarro claimed the tariffs would raise $700bn (\u00a3546bn) a year and - from this - you can get to around $2bn a day. \nIt is not clear how Navarro came up with his figure and analysts have since argued that it could be much lower.\nBBC Verify has asked the White House for Trump's evidence.\nA trade deficit happens when a country buys more from another country than it sells to it and Trump claims the US has a huge one with China.\n\"We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China\", Trump told reporters on 7 April. \nThe US does have a large trade deficit in goods with China.\nOfficial figures show it was just over $295bn (\u00a3230bn) in 2024 - which is far less than the $1tn (\u00a3780bn) claimed by Trump.\nGlobally, in 2024, China exported nearly $1tn (\u00a3780bn) more goods than it imported. \nBut, contrary to what Trump said, that figure applies to all countries, not just the US.\nTrump has claimed that Canada charges US farmers a 270% tariff on their dairy products.\n\"Canada charges for our dairy products 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to 270,\" Trump said. \nIt is correct that Canada does impose high tariffs on US dairy products - including 241% for milk, 270% for dairy powder and 298% for butter - but they only apply under specific conditions.\nUnder the Canadian system, US dairy goods can enter the country duty-free or with very low tariffs - until certain quotas are exceeded. Once this happens, higher tariffs are applied.\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US exported $1.14bn (\u00a3892m) worth of dairy products to Canada in 2024.\nDespite the volume of trade between the two countries, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) - which represents America's dairy industry - said \"the US has never gotten close\" to exceeding the quotas.\nThe IDFA has, however, supported Trump challenging Canada's approach, saying that tariff quotas as well as Canada's milk pricing policy was distorting trade. But it also said a tariff war would \"create uncertainly and additional costs for American dairy farmers\".\nTrade expert David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told BBC Verify that Canada is highly protective of its dairy market, but pointed out that \"President Trump actually negotiated the most recent trade deal between Canada and the US\".\nAs well as China, Trump singled out the European Union (EU) which he said had been formed \"to screw the United States\". \n\"You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm products. They don't take anything\", he said. \nWhile the US imports more cars from the EU than it exports to it, Trump's claim that they take no cars is false. \nIn 2024, the EU imported 164,857 US-made cars valued at \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.6bn), according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).\nMany more did go the other way - 749,170 EU-made cars were exported to the US last year valued at \u20ac38.5bn (\u00a333.3bn).\nTrump's claim about farm products is also false. \nThe EU bought $12.8bn (\u00a310bn) of US agricultural exports in 2024, making the EU America's fourth largest export market - according to the USDA.  \nBBC Verify will be looking at more trade claims. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "Hannah Hampton has kept six clean sheets in 13 England caps\nHannah Hampton appears to be in pole position to take the number one spot for England at the 2025 Women's Euros, with head coach Sarina Wiegman saying she is \"a little bit ahead\" of counterpart Mary Earps.\nEarps has been a mainstay of England's success in recent years, helping the Lionesses win Euro 2022 and reach the final of the 2023 Women's World Cup.\nHowever, she has faced increasing competition from Hampton since the beginning of 2024 and the Chelsea keeper has been preferred for each of England's past three Women's Nations League matches.\nUp until now, Wiegman had been reluctant to confirm who would be her first choice, but that changed in the build-up to kick-off of England's defeat in Belgium.\nSpeaking to ITV, she said: \"I have two world-class goalkeepers. At the moment, [Hannah] is a little bit ahead.\"\nEarps (right) was England's number one when they won Euro 2022\nYou only have to look at Earps' individual accolades to appreciate her quality as a goalkeeper. A two-time Fifa women's goalkeeper of the year, the golden glove winner at the 2023 World Cup, BBC Sports Personality of the Year - the list is endless.\nShe had to fight hard for the gloves on the international stage, making her debut against Switzerland in June 2017 but only earning a further seven caps over the next three years in the face of competition from Karen Bardsley, Carly Telford and fellow youngster Ellie Roebuck.\nWiegman's arrival in 2021 proved a turning point, with Earps starting each of her first seven games in charge and going on to be ever present during Euro 2022, the 2023 World Cup - including a memorable penalty save to deny Jenni Hermoso in the final, and the 2023 Women's Nations League.\nHowever, since the beginning of 2024, Wiegman has favoured rotating her goalkeepers, selecting Hampton in six of England's past 10 matches.\nThe pair traded places in friendlies against Austria, Italy, Germany and South Africa last year. Earps won the gloves for November's much-anticipated meeting with the USA, keeping a clean sheet in the process, but was replaced by Hampton against Switzerland three days later. \nCrucially, the Chelsea keeper, who has six clean sheets in 13 caps, has been selected in three of England's four Women's Nations League matches, including the win over world champions Spain.\nEarps is, by far, the more experienced goalkeeper, earning 53 caps for England and keeping 26 clean sheets. And she's been in good form since swapping Manchester United for Paris St-Germain last summer, conceding just 12 goals in 17 league outings.\nHowever, Hampton is also enjoying an impressive campaign. Establishing herself as Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper this season, she has conceded 13 goals in 18 WSL matches - a record bettered by only Manchester United's Phallon Tullis-Joyce - and featured in their past three Women's Champions League outings.\nAnd with Hampton, who previously played for Birmingham City and Aston Villa, eight years younger than 32-year-old Earps, is this a sign that Wiegman and England are looking to the future?\nHampton and Earps are battling to be England's first-choice goalkeeper\nFormer England striker Ian Wright backed Wiegman's decision to favour Hampton.\n\"[She will improve] the more experience she can get in games and work on her concentration because in respect of everything else, her distribution, I think she's a better goalkeeper,\" he said on ITV.\nHowever, he also praised Earps' character, adding: \"Mary's got main character energy. If she gets a sniff back in that goal, it's going to be tough for Hannah, it'll be tough to get her out. Imagine having Mary Earps as your back-up [at the Euros].\"\nFormer England midfielder Karen Carney says Wiegman's backing for Hampton could help both keepers in making the situation clearer.\nAlso speaking on ITV, she said: \"You often hear goalkeepers say there has to be a clear number one and maybe Sarina Wiegman's helping Hannah prepare for that.\n\"And also showing Mary Earps that Hannah's in ahead of you, and this is going to happen at the tournament, and preparing her for that.\"\nHowever, ex-England striker Ellen White, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Women's Football Weekly podcast, said it could prove a \"a big challenge\" for her former team-mate Earps to adjust to being the back-up keeper.\n\"Mary had been absolutely phenomenal. Her experience on the international stage, tournament after tournament, so it's going to be challenging for her if she is number two.\"\nHead here to get involved",

        "article_text": "We watched every Premier League manager - here's what we found out\nIf you went to watch a football match at the weekend, it's likely you were glued to the action on the pitch rather than what was happening off it.\nAnd the first thing you probably told your friends and family about after the game was the great goal, the extraordinary save or the eye-catching skill you witnessed.\nIt turns out, however, there's a whole other sideshow happening just a few feet from the touchline.\n\"It's psychology in action,\" said Dr Gillian Cook - senior lecturer in sport and performance psychology at Liverpool John Moores University. \"Stress is incredibly high.\"\nThat sideshow, of course, is in the dugout and technical area. And the person feeling the stress is the one responsible for what's happening in front of them - the manager.\n\"They know the influence of what they do on the performance of players,\" added Dr Cook, who has studied the behaviour of managers.\n\"Can they control their stress? Are they able to manipulate their own emotions to help their players perform or do they succumb to those emotions? Do they boil over? Do they get red cards which then will likely have a detrimental impact on the team?\"\nIn an attempt to answer some of those questions, we sent a BBC Sport journalist to all 10 Premier League games during the most recent round of fixtures to closely watch every manager while the action unfolded.\nThey recorded data on where the managers stood and how they interacted with those around them, including their coaching staff, the players on the pitch and the match officials.\nHere's what we saw.\nWhere did each Premier League manager stand this weekend? See all the heatmaps\nHow did we collect the data? Read our methodology\nThe Laws of the Game state managers must remain within the confines of their technical area \"except in special circumstances\" - but that doesn't seem to stop them regularly crossing the boundary.\nOn average, Premier League managers this weekend spent nearly a quarter of games standing outside of their area, getting that bit closer to the pitch, even though the distance gained could usually be measured in centimetres.\nPart of that could be down to visuals.\n\"The players see you more and hear you more and they can actually have feedback,\" said Dr Cook. \"They also know that you're there, so you can have that monitoring effect on them.\n\"You will see the managers point to their heads all the time to have that influence on the players to stay focused.\"\nAnother possible reason could be for a manager to be alone with their thoughts.\nWhen sitting in the dugout, a manager will have their coaching staff around them, plus substitutes and other staff members who could all be voicing their opinions.\nFormer Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson said cancelling out the noise would be a reason why he would go to the edge of his technical area.\n\"Yes, there have been times I've done that,\" Pearson told BBC Sport. \"There have also been times I've asked someone else to go out so they can clear their heads.\"\nDr Cook added: \"It is a stressful environment in a dugout with lots of different people, lots of different voices, and lots of opinions.\n\"If you go out of the technical area, it could actually be a way to help alleviate your stress. You're getting away from some of that noise and potential sensory overload.\n\"We know from research that crowded spaces can overwhelm the senses and can lead to feelings of overwhelmingness - you're not able to think and plan and strategise what you're going to do next.\n\"So it could also be just a way of trying to regulate your own emotions.\"\nWhen all is falling apart on the pitch, a manager can play their part in trying to motivate their players and calm hot heads.\nHow this is done can vary, from being an animated presence to spur the team on or providing an aura of calm in the hope it transfers on to the pitch.\nOn Saturday, Brighton were 2-1 down against Crystal Palace and chasing an equaliser. It all got a bit chaotic towards the end of the game as three red cards were shown \u2013 two to Palace and one to Brighton.\nYet for the majority of the second half, and despite having spent more than half of the opening 45 minutes outside of his technical area altogether, Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler sat in the dugout, when he might have been expected to be driving on his team from the edge of the technical area.\n\"There's a concept in psychology called emotional labour,\" said Dr Cook. \"It originally comes from the airline industry of service with a smile - it doesn't matter what you feel, you've got to act in a certain way because that's what you think is expected of you.\n\"If you're a football manager there is data suggesting that if you look calm, composed and in control, that will transmit and convey to the players. So the more calm you look, the more calm your players will be, and they'll then have the headspace to go out and execute whatever your gameplan is.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola and Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim both prowled the edge of their technical areas during Sunday's derby between the sides, which ended in a disappointing 0-0 draw\nThe weekend's action also showed there are managers who prefer to be the sole presence in the technical area, while others are happy to let their assistants take charge at times.\nBrentford boss Thomas Frank, for example, frequently welcomed input from his staff, while Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca in the opposite dugout rarely retreated to his bench to seek a second opinion.\nFor Pearson, his coaching staff played just as an important role as he did.\nHe even used their different strengths to be able to ensure messages were getting through to players on the pitch as efficiently as possible.\n\"You have to understand the players you have,\" said Pearson, who was most recently manager of Bristol City. \"That is where I use assistants to help me.\n\"If you think about a coaching staff in its entirety there will be people who have certain connections with individual players that will have a meaningful effect. Rather than just being there shouting just to be seen, it is more about communicating with individuals on the pitch.\n\"You can have players who are quite sensitive and you have to be mindful of how those players will accept Information. At Bristol City, for instance, with people like Curtis Fleming and Jason Euell, they are both totally different types of personalities. Use the right people to make the connections.\"\nHowever, Pearson said there were times it was necessary to be the main presence in the technical area.\n\"There are times as a manager you have to be visible and I think that is more important when things are not going well,\" he said. \"It is more important you absorb some of the negativity to allow the players to play.\"\nWhen it came to interactions between the managers and match officials, it was no huge surprise that was most prevalent in the game containing three red cards.\nCrystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner was most perturbed as his side had both Eddie Nketiah and Marc Guehi sent off in the space of 12 minutes.\nElsewhere, Fulham boss Marco Silva was so irritated about a challenge on Rodrigo Muniz which went unpunished that referee Chris Kavanagh had to come over for a word with him.\nBut does getting that annoyed with officials help the players?\n\"On the one hand you have the positive of the manager shouting to try to influence the decision that's being made next time,\" said Dr Cook.\n\"But that is balanced out by the negatives because if you're a player and you see that your manager is getting distressed or very much doesn't agree with the decision that's being made, that takes your focus away.\"\nUnsurprisingly, Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou became most animated during a video assistant referee (VAR) check - and we all know how much he loves that.\nFaced by a four-minute delay as he awaited a decision, he appeared to play a game of rock, paper, scissors to highlight the unpredictable nature of a VAR call.\n\"VAR is interesting because in the past they put a heart-rate monitor on Brentford manager Thomas Frank and his heart rate went up from 60 beats per minute to 108  beats per minute when a VAR decision was being made,\" said Dr Cook.\n\"So what we saw Ange doing with rock, paper, scissors, I would suggest, could be because he was trying to distract himself - that's another way that we can regulate the emotions.\"\nA variety of styles can be seen on the touchline in the Premier League\nTracksuit or suit - it's a debate as old as time.\nSo what did our data tell us? Predictably, very little. Five managers wore tracksuit bottoms, four of them failed to win. That's as good as it gets.\nWhile a manager's attire may have nothing to do with what happens on the pitch, though, it does tell us a bit about them.\n\"We've all heard the expression power dressing,\" said Dr Cook. \"If you're in a suit, particularly according to research with doctors, they're rated as having higher authority, higher power and higher credibility.\n\"Obviously, that's with doctors, not football managers. But research with sports psychologists has found that if they wear tracksuits then their sports-specific knowledge is deemed to be higher.\n\"So, as a manager, what do you value? Do you want people to see you as the authority figure looking different from everyone else? Or do you want to fit in in a tracksuit that will be the same as your background staff and be seen to have higher sport-specific knowledge?\n\"Which of those you value will then determine how you want to dress.\"\nWe've pored through the data, we've studied the heatmaps, we've done the sums. Lots of sums.\nOne thing is clear - every manager does it their own way and sometimes that way is successful and sometimes it isn't.\nBut when we asked both Dr Cook and Pearson - coming at this from different angles - what it actually all boils down to, they both used the same word: authenticity.\n\"A key construct in management is trust,\" said Dr Cook. \"Do you trust your manager? If you trust what they suggest you should do, you're then more likely to work harder. The harder you work, the better you're likely to perform.\n\"And are they acting the same way in training when they're away from the performance arena? Or are they suddenly acting differently in a stadium? Because if there's a difference there, then it comes away as it's not as authentic.\n\"That can then reduce trust because one of the key factors that comes into trust is predictability and authenticity.\"\nAs Pearson, who has stood in the dugout as a manager for more than 600 games, concluded: \"It's about being authentic and making sure that people have the information.\"",

So, I checked in with him to find out if he still thinks childhood is at risk from too much screen time.\nParents need help. I know from experience. It's really hard to get kids off their screens when all their friends are stuck on theirs. This addiction demands collective action.\nIn the days since I spoke with Haidt, there's been one thing that he said that I haven't been able to get off my mind.\u00a0\n\"I have not met one member of Gen Z who's in denial, who says, 'No, we love the phones, the phones are good for us,'\" Haidt told me. \"They all see what's happening, but they feel trapped.\"\u00a0\nSo, has anything actually changed in the year since Haidt's book? Was all the hype around mobile phones just a flash-in-the-pan moment of collective parental anxiety or did it produce the kind of action many parents are longing for?\nWatch our full conversation, here:\nBelow is an excerpt from our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nKatty Kay: It's been a year since your book came out and caused a huge conversation. I wanted to start by getting a kind of report card of where we are on the various aspects of what you're trying to do: phones in school, age gating, social media, getting kids to have more free playtime. Who's doing well and who isn't in America on all of those issues?\u00a0\nJonathan Haidt: I knew that the book was going to be popular. What I wasn't prepared for is that this issue would spread like wildfire around the world, not just in the US. Because around the world, family life has turned into a fight over screen time. Everyone hates it. Everyone sees it.\nWhere it took off most quickly was phone-free schools, because that is something that is very easily done. It's so hard to teach to a classroom when half of them are watching short videos and playing video games. So, the teachers have hated the phones from the beginning but they were afraid, especially in America \u2013 maybe it's the same in the UK \u2013 but in America, there are a lot of parents who want to be able to communicate all the time with their child, and they think they have a right to check in on their child. And, 'What if something goes wrong? I need to be there.' So, the overparenting \u2014\nKK: That's a paradox, then, because you've got the parents who are super worried about the phones; they see what phones are doing to their kids. But they also don't want their kids to relinquish their phones when they go into school.\nJH: Hey, look, people are complicated! They contain multitudes. And I shouldn't say that everyone saw the problem, because there were a lot of parents who saw the phone as a lifeline. They see the world as very threatening and dangerous. And so, early on in this process, I thought there would be this uniquely American thing about overprotection, because we do have a lot more crime than you do in Europe or Canada.\u00a0\nBut the surprising thing, to me, as I've been studying this for a while now, is that the vast overprotection swept through all of the English-speaking countries in the '90s. So, all the English-speaking countries went through this at the same time. And now, all of them are taking action really quickly. UK and Australia, I'd say, are in the lead in terms of actually passing legislation.\nKK: Here in the United States, we've seen some battles go through Congress, but this has not happened at a national level. What I am seeing is individual states enact laws to stop kids having phones in school.\u00a0\nJH: That's right, because we don't have a functioning legislature in the United States. We have Congress. And Congress can't really do anything if anybody objects. So, from the beginning, I have not assumed we're going to get a damn bit of help from Congress. I've been focusing on the 50 US states and on the UK, Australia and the EU. If we get legislative change in those domains, we win.\nKK: Is it too early to see what the impact is in schools that ban phones? Do we have any data on that yet or is this just a supposition that they're going to do better?\u00a0\nJH: We have reports from schools that go phone-free. And I challenge people to look around for a school that went truly phone-free, not just during class time. If it's just a restriction during class time, that's not phone-free. That causes all kinds of problems. All the kids are on their phones in between classes. But truly phone-free, where you turn in phones in the morning and you get back in the evening, the reports are raves.\u00a0\nThe most common things they say are that discipline problems are down. There's just a lot less fighting, a lot less drama. Truancy is down. School is a lot more fun when you can actually talk with your friends and play with them and laugh with them. So, truancy goes down, tardiness goes down, kids arrive on time. And the most thrilling thing for me, and the most universal thing they say is we hear laughter in the hallways again. So, the reports are uniformly raves. There's often some resistance in the first week or two, but what they mostly say is \u2014\nKK: Who's the resistance from?\u00a0\nJH: Some of the kids don't like it and some of the parents don't like it. But I've spoken to hundreds and hundreds of school superintendents. What they're telling me is they expected a huge pushback from parents, but they actually didn't get it. Because this year is different. The zeitgeist has changed.\nActually, it started in the UK even before my book came out. You had smartphone-free schools; they went viral in February of last year and my book didn't come out until March. So, it's a different environment now, and schools are ready to act. Now, there are some studies, there are some academic studies that have been equivocal, but when you look at them \u2013 there was one that came out in the UK, it was published in the Lancet.\nIt said phone-free schools don't help. No, it didn't. It looked at like eight schools that had a backpack policy, which is not very good, and then like 11 or 15 schools that had a classroom-ban policy. It was like there was a slight difference in policies. These are very different schools. So, we have a Substack post showing this Lancet study doesn't show anything of the sort. There was a study in the UK done by Policy Exchange, where they looked at several hundred UK schools, and only about 10% are truly phone-free. If you look at the schools in the UK that are truly phone-free, and you compare them to the others, then you do find academic benefits and behavioural benefits.\nKK: I want to go back to something you said at the beginning about the 1990s and how that became a time of fear. I've been a working mother my whole life. I have four children: two of whom were born in the 90s, one was born in 2000, one was born in 2006. So, they've all had different experiences with screens. But from the research that I've done, something else happened in the kind of 80s and 90s, which was a sort of expansion of what we deem to be a good parent, and more specifically than that, a good mother, right? So, women were taking on full-time jobs and still doing the overwhelming share of household chores.\nBut it's not just that. In my research, women today are doing as much in the way of household chores as their great-grandmothers were in the early part of the 1900s. It's that society somehow deemed us not to be good parents if we weren't spending an enormous amount of time with our kids, spending our weekends running ragged taking them to events. And somehow you got, particularly perhaps if you were a working mother, the kind of guilt exploded. I feel like screens \u2013 and I've seen it with my own kids \u2013 screens just became a kind of form of relief for parents, and mothers in particular, from whom society was just asking impossible things.\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0Every word you said is true. I'll just try to add on to it. It is a puzzle. And I've got a really bizarre graph in the book showing that the amount of time that mothers and fathers spent parenting was fairly flat in the 80s and even into the 90s. And then all of a sudden in the mid 1990s, at least in the US, it jumped up. Something changed in the 90s. And it's the norm that you're talking about.\u00a0\nKK:\u00a0Great, I moved here in '96, so I just hit right at the right moment! [Laughter]\nJH:\u00a0You just hit it! That's right. So, that really did happen. Women today have fewer children than their grandmothers did, and they're working outside the home, which their grandmothers didn't, and they're spending more time with the kids. So, a lot of this has fallen on women.\u00a0\nNow, why did this happen? The best answer comes from this really wonderful book called Paranoid Parenting by Frank Furedi. He's a British sociologist and he's focusing on what happened in the UK, not the US, although he points out that the same things happened in the US and Canada. And what happened, he says, is we lost trust in other people. And when that happens, then we don't trust our neighbourhood. We don't trust people to send our kids out.\u00a0\nIt's always been the case that raising kids was kind of a joint project. When you lose that, now every family is on their own. And that means it's mostly the mothers who are on their own.\nKK:\u00a0In your sort of meta analysis of screens and kids and schools, and whether we can have phones in schools, is it actually the case that we have to address those issues before we can really wean our kids off this screen addiction?\nJH:\u00a0We have to understand those issues first if we want to fully understand what happened historically. But I would not say that we have to address those issues first, because, frankly, we're not going to address them. I mean reversing the decline of community, you know, I go to all kinds of meetings about that. There are all kinds of foundations. But look, technology changes society \u2014\nKK:\u00a0Can you just fix it all, Jon? [Laughter] I mean, I know you've done phones in schools, but really, step it up!\u00a0\nJH:\u00a0[Laughter] Yeah. Let's fix community next! So, no, we're not going to restore trust in our neighbours such that we can let our kids out. That's not going to happen. In fact, it's likely to get a lot worse as we go into the\u00a0era of AI, when we have no idea what's true. We're never going to know what's true again for a very long time, if ever. So, rather, we have to adapt to this. And I think the way we adapt to this onslaught of technology is by saying, \"Okay, you know what? Kids are not adults.\"\nWe have to focus on what it will take to allow kids to have healthy brain development through puberty. That's my mission. We've got to give kids a lot less screen time. A lot less fragmenting time. No TikTok. No short videos. That's the worst, and give them a lot more experience interacting with people.\nKK:\u00a0What do you say to poorer families where both parents have to work multiple jobs and for whom the invention of screen content that occupies their small children is just literally a lifesaver for them? Is there a different argument there or not?\nJH:\u00a0Yes, there is. So, the way to understand this is that in the 90s, when we were all techno-optimists, the internet was amazing. The early internet was amazing. And rich kids had computers and internet access and poor kids didn't. And so in the 1990s, we had a big thing, you know, it was educational equity.\u00a0Bill Gates, all kinds of philanthropists donated hundreds of millions of dollars. Let's get every kid a computer.\nSo, in the early 2000s, we're all techno-optimists and we think, 'Well, okay, I don't trust my kid to walk three blocks to a store, but he's on a computer. What could happen? He's learning! That's great!' We think it's good that our kids are upstairs on a computer. And, of course, this is one of the central ideas in the\u00a0Netflix show Adolescence\u00a0is, you know, parents think their kids are safe when they're on a computer. And in the 90s, they mostly were. There was some bad stuff, too, but they mostly were.\u00a0\nBut once the internet gets taken over, or at least once childhood gets\u00a0owned by three or four big companies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0TikTok, Snap, Meta and Google \u2013 once childhood is owned by these companies that are using algorithms to send them content, to keep them hooked, this is when things get much darker. Kids on computers now, they're not learning to program. They're not learning any useful skills. They're just basically lying there consuming content. And this is when it gets really sick and really dark.\nEditorial Note:\nTikTok told the BBC's Marianna Spring it has \"industry-leading\" safety settings for teens, and Meta cites its own tools for \"positive and age-appropriate experiences\". Read more about how social media companies address concerns of children's safety online, here.\nBut we don't quite realise that. And so what's happened now is the educational equity issue has reversed. It used to be \"get poor kids computers\". But by the 2000s, what was clear was that the rich people, and especially the people in Silicon Valley, don't let their kids have this stuff. So, now the great educational equity imperative is we've got to give the poor kids the same protections that the rich kids have. We've got to get them less time on screens. You said it's literally a lifesaver. I would say no, it's not literally a lifesaver. It literally is a brain-scrambler.\nKK: A lot of what you write about and the way you write is targeted at adults. If you were to go into schools and talk to middle school children, what would be the most effective argument you could make to them?\nJH: I'm glad you asked that, because just before our conversation, I was in an hour-long conversation with my team. We're creating a version of The Anxious Generation for 8-to-12 year olds, for kids who don't yet have a smartphone. And the main thing that we want to convey to them is that there are these companies that are going to try to hook you. And they've hooked most kids. If you look at the kids older than you, they're not having fun. They're lonely, they're sad. Because they all got sucked into just being content consumers, that's all they do. But do you want to have an amazing, exciting life? Do you want to do things? Do you want to have fun with your friends?\nDon't go down that route. Don't let these companies trick you and suck you in. One of the key ideas in The Anxious Generation is this is not a book about screens; this is a book about childhood. What kind of childhood do we want for our kids?\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "In 1966, the remote Spanish village of Palomares found that the \"nuclear age had fallen on them from a clear blue sky\". Two years after the terrifying accident, BBC reporter Chris Brasher went to find what happened when the US lost a hydrogen bomb.\nOn 7 April 1966, almost 60 years ago this week, a missing nuclear weapon for which the US military had been desperately searching for 80 days was finally found. The warhead, with an explosive power 100 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, was carefully winched from a depth of 2,850ft (869m) out of the Mediterranean Sea and delicately lowered onto the USS Petrel. Once it was on board, officers painstakingly cut into the thermonuclear device's casing to disarm it. It was only then that everyone could breathe a sigh of relief \u2013 the last of the four hydrogen bombs that the US had accidentally dropped on Spain had been recovered.\n\"This was not the first accident involving nuclear weapons,\" said BBC reporter Chris Brasher when he reported from the scene in 1968. \"The Pentagon lists at least nine previous accidents to aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs. But this was the first accident on foreign soil, the first to involve civilians and the first to excite the attention of the world.\"\nThis terrifying situation had come about because of a US operation code-named Chrome Dome. At the beginning of the 1960s, the US had developed a project to deter its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union, from launching a pre-emptive strike. A patrol of nuclear-armed B-52 bombers would continuously criss-cross the skies, primed to attack Moscow at a moment's notice. But to stay airborne on these long looping routes, the planes needed to refuel while in flight.\nOn 17 January 1966, one such bomber was flying at a height of 31,000ft (9.5km) over the Almer\u00eda region of southern Spain, and attempted a routine air-to-air refuelling with a KC-135 tanker plane. \"I believe what happened was the bomber was closing at a too-high rate of closure speed and he didn't stabilise his position,\" US Maj Gen Delmar Wilson, the man in charge of dealing with the catastrophic accident, told Brasher, \"with the result that they got too close and collided.\"\nThe B-52 bomber's impact with the refuelling plane tore it open, igniting the jet fuel the KC-135 was carrying and killing all four of the crew onboard. The ensuing explosion also killed two men in the B-52's tail section. A third managed to eject, but died when his parachute did not open. The other four members of the bomber's crew successfully bailed out of their burning plane before it broke apart and fell to earth, raining down both flaming aircraft fragments and its lethal thermonuclear cargo onto the remote Spanish village of Palomares.\nThe huge fireball was seen a mile away. Thankfully, it did not trigger a nuclear explosion. The bomber's warheads were not armed and had built-in safeguards to prevent an unintended atomic chain reaction. But the thermonuclear devices did have explosives surrounding their plutonium cores as part of the triggering mechanism. In the event of an accident, the bombs had parachutes attached to them designed to cushion the impact on landing and prevent radioactive contamination. And indeed, one undetonated bomb did land safely in a riverbed and was recovered intact the following day. Unfortunately, two of the plummeting nuclear bombs' parachutes failed to open.\nThat morning, Spanish farmer Pedro Alarc\u00f3n was walking to his house with his grandchildren when one of the nuclear bombs landed in his tomato field and blew apart on impact. \"We were blown flat. The children started to cry. I was paralysed with fear. A stone hit me in the stomach, I thought I'd been killed. I lay there feeling like death with the children crying,\" he told the BBC in 1968.\nThe other hydrogen bomb also exploded when it hit the ground near a cemetery. These dual blasts created vast craters and scattered highly toxic, radioactive plutonium dust across several hundred acres. Burning aircraft debris also showered the Spanish village. \"I was crying and running about,\" a villager called Se\u00f1ora Flores told the BBC in 1968. \"My little girl was crying, 'Mama, Mama, look at our house, it is burning.' Because of all the smoke I thought what she said must be true. There were a lot of stones and debris falling around us. I thought it would hit us. It was this terrific explosion. We thought it was the end of the world.\"\nOnce the news that the bomber had come down with nuclear weapons aboard reached US military command, a huge operation was launched. At the time of the disaster, Capt Joe Ramirez was an US Air Force lawyer stationed in Madrid. \"There were a lot of people talking, there was a lot of excitement in the conference room. Everyone kept talking about a 'broken arrow'. I learnt then that 'broken arrow' was the code word for a nuclear accident,\" he told BBC's Witness History in 2011.\nUS military personnel were scrambled to the area by helicopter. When Capt Ramirez arrived in Palomares, he immediately saw the devastation and chaos wrought by the accident. Huge pieces of smoking wreckage were strewn all over the area \u2013 a large part of the burning B-52 bomber had landed in the school's yard. \"It's a small village but there were people scrambling in different directions. I could see smouldering debris, I could see some fires.\"\nIN HISTORY\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nDespite the carnage, miraculously no one in the village was killed. \"Nearly 100 tonnes of flaming debris had fallen on the village but not even a chicken had died,\" said Brasher. A local school teacher and doctor climbed up to the fire-scarred hillside to retrieve the remains of the US airmen who had been killed. \"Later still, they sorted the pieces and the limbs into five coffins, an act that was to cause a certain amount of bureaucratic difficulty when the Americans came to claim only four bodies from that hillside,\" said Brasher.\nThree of the B-52 crew who managed to eject landed in the Mediterranean several miles off the coast and were rescued by local fishing boats within an hour of the accident. The fourth, the B-52 radar-navigator, ejected through the plane's explosion, which left him badly burned, and was unable to separate himself from his ejection seat. Despite this, he managed to open his parachute and was found alive near the village and taken to hospital.\nHowever, this still left the problem of locating the plane's deadly nuclear payload. \"My main concern was to recover those bombs, that was number-one priority,\" Gen Wilson told the BBC in 1968.\n\"The first night, the Guardia Civil [the Spanish national police force] had come to the little bar in Palomares, and that was about the only place that had electricity. And they had reported what they considered to be a bomb, so we immediately despatched some of our people to this riverbed which is not far from the centre of town, and, in fact, it was a bomb, so we placed a guard on that. And then the next morning, at first daylight, we started conducting our search, and I believe it was something in the order of 10am or 11am the following morning, we located two other bombs.\"\nThis accounted for three of the nuclear bombs, but there was still one missing. By the next day, trucks filled with US troops had been sent from nearby bases, with the beach in Palomares becoming a base for some 700 US airmen and scientists urgently trying to contain any radioactive contamination and locate the fourth warhead.\n\"The first thing that you could see as the search really got underway in earnest was Air Force personnel linking up hand-by-hand and 40 or 50 people in a line. They would have designated search areas. There were some people with Geiger counters who started arriving, and so they started marking off the areas which were contaminated,\" said Capt Ramirez in 2011. When US personnel registered an area contaminated with radiation, they would scrape up the first three inches of topsoil and seal it in barrels to be shipped back to the US. Some 1,400 tonnes of irradiated soil ended up being sent to a storage facility in South Carolina.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How a US general nearly started a nuclear war in 1950\n\u2022 The greatest sailing rescue ever made\n\u2022 How Russia launched a giant space mirror in 1993\nBoth the US and Spain, which at the time was under the brutal rule of Francisco Franco's military dictatorship, were keen to downplay the devastating accident. Franco was especially worried that radiation fears would hurt Spain's tourism industry, a major source of revenue for his regime. In an effort to reassure the local population and the wider world that there was no danger, the US Ambassador to Spain, Angier Biddle Duke, would end up taking a swim in the sea off Palomares coast in front of the international press just weeks after the accident.\nBut despite hundreds of US personnel conducting an intensive and meticulous search of the surrounding area for a week, they still couldn't find the fourth bomb. Then Capt Ramirez spoke to a local fisherman who had helped rescue some of the surviving airmen who had splashed down in the sea. The fisherman kept apologising to Capt Ramirez for not being able to save one of the US flyers, whom he thought he had witnessed drifting down into the depths.\u00a0\nCapt Ramirez realised that the fisherman could have actually seen the missing nuclear bomb. \"All the bodies had been accounted for, I knew that,\" he said. The search then quickly shifted to the Mediterranean Sea, with the US Navy mobilising a flotilla of more than 30 ships, including mine-sweepers and submersibles, to scour the seabed. The exploration of miles of ocean floor was both technically complicated and a very slow process, but after weeks of exhaustive searching, a newly developed deep-diving vessel, Alvin, finally located the missing bomb in an underwater trench.\nNearly four months after it was first lost, the warhead was finally made safe and back in US hands. The next day, despite the secrecy with which the US military had surrounding its nuclear arsenal, it took the unusual step of showing the bomb to the world's press. Ambassador Duke reasoned that unless people saw the bomb for themselves, they would never feel certain that it had actually been recovered.\nAlmost six decades later, the incident still casts a long shadow over the Almer\u00eda region. The US clean-up operation managed to miss some areas of contamination, and the US and Spain agreed to fund yearly health-checks for Palomares residents. They also promised to monitor the soil, the water, the air and local crops. But there are still some 100 acres (40 hectares) of contaminated land in Palomares that remain fenced off. And despite Spain and the US signing a mutual agreement in 2015 to clean up the area, neither has yet complied.\u00a0\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

'We thought it was the end of the world': How the US dropped four nuclear bombs on Spain in 19661 day agoShareSaveMyles BurkeShareSaveAlamy(Credit: Alamy)In 1966, the remote Spanish village of Palomares found that the \"nuclear age had fallen on them from a clear blue sky\". In an effort to reassure the local population and the wider world that there was no danger, the US Ambassador to Spain, Angier Biddle Duke, would end up taking a swim in the sea off Palomares coast in front of the international press just weeks after the accident.But despite hundreds of US personnel conducting an intensive and meticulous search of the surrounding area for a week, they still couldn't find the fourth bomb. \"This accounted for three of the nuclear bombs, but there was still one missing.

She said the doll celebrates \"LeBron as a role model,\" his ability as an icon to transcend culture and set a \"positive example for the next generation.\"\nThe doll features the Los Angeles Lakers basketball player in his pre-game fashion and reflects his height - it's an inch taller than the standard Ken doll. \nIn reality, the athlete is 6ft 9in tall.\nThe new doll comes as the company is facing financial uncertainty amid President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China, where just under 40% of Mattel's production is based.\nTrump announced on Wednesday that tariffs on goods from China would increase to 125%. He accused Beijing of a \"lack of respect\" after it retaliated and said it would impose tariffs of 84% on US imports.\nIn the same announcement, Trump announced a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs and authorised a universal \"lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%\" as negotiations continued with roughly 60 countries. \nMattel has said it may have to increase prices and possibly implement changes to its supply chain. Consumer and business groups in the US have warned that the tariffs may disrupt supply chains and lead to higher prices.\nThe new Ken doll doesn't show the athlete in his basketball uniform. Instead, he's dressed in a varsity jacket adorned with \"LJ\" on the front. \nIt includes an Ohio patch and a crown patch on one sleeve and the number 23 - his basketball jersey number - on the other. On the back, \"LeBron\" is boldly printed along with the phrase, \"Just a kid from Akron\" - the Ohio city where he was born. \nUnder the jacket, the doll wears a shirt that reads \"We Are Family,\" a nod to the star's foundation. The doll includes accessories like a basketball, headphones and sneakers.\nIn a promotional video released by Mattel, Mr James reacted to see the doll for the first time. \"Oh, he dope!\" he says as he's given the figurine. \"That's so cool!\" \nAs he toyed with the doll's accessories, he joked the LeBron Ken doll \"might have to do a little lifting, legs are looking skinny\". \nThe move is a significant moment for the 65-year-old Barbie brand, which has made a push in recent years to diversify its dolls and reflect a broader range of careers, body types and backgrounds.\nThough Barbie has previously honoured athletes like Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and Megan Rapinoe, Mr James is the first male sports figure - and the first male figure not from the entertainment industry - to join the lineup.\nEven with four NBA titles, two Olympic gold medals, and a scoring record to his name, Mr James says his new title of \"Kenbassador\" hits differently\u2014because it's about more than basketball.\n\"It's an opportunity to recognize the powerful impact of role models who instill confidence, inspire dreams, and show kids that they, too, can achieve greatness.\"",

        "article_text": "Listen to James read this article\n\"The best salesman in history.\" This was what Donald Trump once called Volodymyr Zelensky because of the amount of aid the US has given Ukraine.\nWhether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.\nHis transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day. \nIn the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.\nBut with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.\nPolitically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests. \nBut is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?\nLater today the \"coalition of the willing\", a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine, will meet at Nato headquarters - notably without America. \nBefore Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.\nHis message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.\n\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nHis decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold. \n\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"\nLeshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"\nUkraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.\nLater in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.\n\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.\n\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"\nBut when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.\nAfter Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.\nMaria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.\n\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.\n\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"\nOn 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.\nOn that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.\nTensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".\nAfter the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.\nDespite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry. \nThe pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.\n\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.\nMr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".\n\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"\n\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Penta Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"\nThen there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".\nWhile Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.\n\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"\nWhen it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".\nHis defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.\nZelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.\nA mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv. \nThe US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.\nBut the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.\n\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"\nWhen the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.\n\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"\nWhatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.\nYet others argue more bend still is needed.\n\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.\n\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"\nMr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"\nAnd yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.\n\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.\nOrysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.\n\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".\nMr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".\nSome political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.\n\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"\nProf Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".\nStill, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.\nFor now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.\nAs for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?\n\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Vicky Riddell\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "We know Kevin de Bruyne is leaving Manchester City in the summer, but who else might be going - and who should stay?\nTheir rebuild has already started, with \u00a3180m spent on four players in January, but a major overhaul of Pep Guardiola's side looks likely at the end of what has been a troubled campaign, with the future of several stars in doubt.\n\"It feels like there are going to be big changes right through the squad,\" former City goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Sport.\n\"City fans must have watched Sunday's Manchester derby and been thinking they have no idea what the future will look like - right now, no-one does.\n\"They spent a lot in January, and Omar Marmoush has been the stand-out signing from the players they brought in, but the others have struggled a bit.\n\"Nico Gonzalez and Abdukodir Khusanov are still adjusting to the pace of the Premier League, which shows why this rebuild won't be easy.\n\"In the past, any City signings under Guardiola have come into a team that was a winning machine, full of confidence and usually top of the league.\n\"It is a lot easier to join a side that is brimming with confidence and ripping teams apart every week, but Marmoush, Nico, Khusanov and Vitor Reis have joined a different City, with players who look nervous and the team struggling with and without the ball.\"\nAll four of City's midfielders who started Sunday's derby are over 30\nCity's lack of physicality in midfield has been a key factor in their decline and it is the area of the team that could see the biggest overhaul.\nA fit-again Rodri will surely return as the fulcrum of their side when he recovers from his long-term injury, but who will be alongside him is much less certain.\n\"De Bruyne says he is going, there are doubts over Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan's future and Jack Grealish has not really had a look in,\" Given explained.\n\"Bernardo and Gundogan have been such great players and won everything there is to win, but time catches up with everyone - like De Bruyne, they are both in their 30s now.\n\"It doesn't matter what they have done for City in the past, Guardiola will know he has to freshen things up.\"\nBayer Leverkusen's Germany international Florian Wirtz is high on City's list of targets, but Given feels they could have found the answer a lot closer to home.\n\"There are lots of players who City have let go recently, who they could really do with now,\" he said.\n\"Cole Palmer is an obvious one but I covered an Aston Villa game the other day and Morgan Rogers would bring all of the things that City need - pace, power and creativity.\n\"Imagine if he had only been loaned out in 2023, not sold, and there was the possibility of bringing him back in the summer? You would be thinking problem solved, the likes of Gundogan and De Bruyne can go.\n\"It's not going to be that simple, of course. City sold Rogers to Middlesbrough for about \u00a31.5m but think how much he would cost them now?\"\nGrealish scored City's first goal in Wednesday's 2-0 win over Leicester but was left out of the starting XI at Old Trafford. He replaced Ilkay Gundogan with 16 minutes to go\nIf there is an overhaul at the Etihad, then it will be with new faces, rather than tactics.\nGuardiola is never going to move away from a possession-based playing style and Given feels the old guard can no longer implement an important part of his gameplan.\n\"A lot of teams City play in the Premier League seem to have more energy, or legs, in the team,\" Given said. \"That's been an issue, because the way they press without the ball is so important to their playing style.\n\"A big part of their success down the years under Pep was when they won the ball back quickly, high up the pitch, within a few seconds of losing it.\n\"They would peg teams back and not let them out but now teams are getting through them. \n\"That needs to be rectified. It's something that will come with fresh legs from the people coming in, but that won't solve all the problems City have, because any new signings have to be the highest quality too.\n\"With De Bruyne leaving, I would love to see Guardiola build the team around Jack Grealish playing in a central role and dominating games, but it looks like the writing is on the wall for him to go as well.\n\"For whatever reason, it appears they are not getting on so it does not look good for Jack. He comes in, plays a game or two and then is back out again, no matter how well he does.\"\n\"I'm not just a fan of his, I am his ex-team-mate and friend. It's frustrating to see him being treated this way, because I know he has got so much more to offer the team. He just doesn't get the opportunities, and that is the manager's decision.\"\nStones was injured early in City's Champions League defeat by Real Madrid on 19 February and has not played since\nCity's defensive flaws have not been helped by a series of injuries to their senior centre-halves.\nRuben Dias, Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake have all missed chunks of the season - Akanji and Ake are currently sidelined after surgery - while John Stones has been restricted to just six league starts.\nKhusanov and Reis, who have only recently turned 21 and 19 respectively, arrived as defensive reinforcements in January but Given would be wary of making sweeping  changes at the back.\n\"None of the four established centre-halves are near their mid-30s yet,\" Given said. \"Stones is the oldest, and he turns 31 in May, so I still feel they have all got plenty to offer. I'd be reluctant to let any of them go. With Stones, for example, they just have to get him fit.\n\"If the club considers them all to be injury prone, then that is a problem. But equally you can't just get rid of all that experience, because you need it in that position. A situation next season where Khusanov and Reis are at centre-half would be a bit worrying.\"\nThere is further uncertainty over the futures of Kyle Walker, on loan at AC Milan, and goalkeeper Ederson, who considered a move to Saudi Arabia last year before committing to another campaign at the Etihad.\n\"The club could get big money for Ederson to fund signings, but then they would have to replace him too,\" Given added.\n\"There are definitely other positions they should be looking at. Ederson is a brilliant goalkeeper, who is so vital to the way they play out from the back. I don't think there is another keeper in the world who is better with the ball at his feet.\n\"He is only 31, so he has plenty of years left at the very top level - I was 33 when I joined City, so I would certainly not be rushing him out of the door - they should try to keep hold of him if they can.\"\nEderson joined City from Benfica for \u00a335m in 2017. He won the Premier League Golden Glove award for most clean sheets in a season for three years running between 2020 and 2022\nWhatever City's next step is, they will have a new voice shaping their transfer strategy. Txiki Begiristain is leaving in the summer with Hugo Viana replacing him as director of football.\n\"I played with Hugo at Newcastle and I am looking forward to meeting him again,\" Given said. \"I am excited to see how he gets on at City but Txiki has left big boots to fill. For a long time City's transfers were brilliant, they hardly put a foot wrong.\n\"Fixing the squad is part of Hugo's job now but there is a lot of transition going on at the club and there is no guarantee any of it will be smooth.\n\"We are about to find out what Pep's masterplan is too and it will be fascinating to see how he does next season - he has only known amazing success with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City and this is the first time in his managerial career that things have not gone his way.\n\"Can he rebuild City, and come back and win the Premier League again? That is the big question right now, isn't it?\"",

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg.

        "article_text": "From romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.\nWhile much of Europe is ripe with history, culture, cuisine and breathtaking landscapes, some spots are particularly primed to welcome visitors right now.\nThis is not your typical all-time European getaway list; you won't find Rome or London here. Paris made the cut because of its post-Olympics peacefulness (plus the reopening of Notre Dame, an icon that has finally found its voice). Instead of a lifetime bucket list, we've curated 2025-specific picks that will make this year's holidays particularly memorable. Many of these are unsung destinations free from the overcrowding that's caused tourism upheaval \u2013 and rows with locals \u2013 in highly touristed European cities for the last several years.\nThese are on-the-rise areas of Europe where you can experience iconic cultural sites, spectacular hotels and outdoor adventures. From spending days on the sun-soaked Mediterranean coast to climbing the highest Alpine peaks, here are nine exciting European destinations to visit in 2025.\nPuglia saw a 20% jump in international arrivals in 2024 with more than 15 million overnight stays \u2013 still a fraction of Rome's 51 million. With two international airports (Bari and Brindisi) and rising interest, now is the time to visit before word gets out much further.\n\"The heel of Italy's boot offers incredible value compared to the Amalfi Coast with authentic masserie\u00a0(farmhouse hotels) being converted into luxury properties,\" says California-based travel advisor and photographer Coco Tran, who has been researching and photographing Italy for years. \"The region's celebration of slow food, incredible coastline and Unesco sites like Alberobello make it exceptional,\" she adds. In 2025, travellers can also experience the Jubilee Puglia, a Catholic event that only takes place every 25 years, aligning with larger events in Rome.\nTran recommends booking a table at cliff-side Osteria Sant'Anna in Polignano a Mare where the morning's catch is served fresh. On warm days, take a dip at Grotta della Poesia (Poetry Cave), a picture-perfect natural swimming hole; or saunter through Lecce's Baroque-filled streets. And while it's a new year, some old favourites remain the same. Tran says Masseria Torre Coccaro remains the spot to stay, with white-washed rooms surrounded by ancient olive groves \u2013 plus villas with private plunge pools so you can soak it all in without another guest in sight.\u00a0\nBest time to visit: Puglia's shoulder seasons, in late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October), offer ideal weather and fewer crowds.\nPortugal continues to attract global attention, but there's far more to this Iberian nation than Porto and Lisbon. One region finally stepping into the spotlight is the Alentejo coast, which experienced its best tourism year on record in 2024.\n\"Portugal's Alentejo coast is finally getting deserved attention, with its pristine beaches and fantastic wineries,\" says Tran. While many travellers tack the region onto a trip to Lisbon or the Algarve, this breathtaking section of coast is worth a dedicated journey \u2013 especially for those seeking nature, history and adventure.\nWho picked the list?\nStacey Leasca is an award-winning travel journalist living in Lisbon, Portugal, with two decades of experience covering destinations across Europe and beyond. She served as adjunct professor of journalism at the University of Southern California and is a PhD candidate specialising in building resiliency to disinformation in journalism.\u00a0\nThe area's \"mix of coastal beauty, incredible cycling routes and overall affordability compared to many other places in Europe\" make it an ideal getaway for thrill-seekers, says Maria Elena Price of\u00a0ExperiencePlus! Bicycle Tours, which hosts tours around the world, including the Alentejo Coast.\n\u00c9vora, a Unesco-listed city with Roman ruins and medieval architecture, is ideal for history buffs; while Zambujeira do Mar offers one of the nation's most beautiful beaches. Throughout June, travellers can also take part in the famed\u00a0Festas dos Santos Populares\u00a0(Popular Saints' Festivals), a nationwide celebration of Portugal's patron saints. Base yourself at\u00a0Craveiral, a boutique stay where more than 70% of the restaurant's ingredients come from its on-site farm \u2013 including the toppings on its wood-fired pizzas.\nBest time to visit:\u00a0Summer is a blast in the Alentejo, with busy beaches and hiking through the\u00a0Fisherman's Trail. If you prefer thinner crowds, you'll still find spectacular weather in the autumn, between September and November.\u00a0\nAbout five million people visit Chamonix a year, while a million others visit Verbier \u2013 both rightly famous for their epic snowfalls and fantastic on- and off-piste terrain. However, it's high time global travellers explored the less-touristed European peaks \u2013 specifically, Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, three interconnected resorts that together offer 180km of skiable terrain. And while the skiing is already supreme, Mike Goar, who is the COO of mountain operations in Switzerland for Vail Resorts, says 2025 will see the investment of 110m Swiss francs (\u00a389.5m) into mountain improvements such as snowmaking, meaning it's only going to get better.\nHowever, this destination is not just for winter. In any season, you can ride the Glacier Express train through the Alpine region, take a day hike to the glacial Lago di Tom or visit the nearby Uri Alps for a multi-day cycling trip. This region offers that small Alpine village feel \u2013 including a seemingly endless supply of fondue \u2013 and fewer crowds than its better-known Swiss counterparts. Stay at the luxurious Chedi Andermatt, which offers easy access to the slopes; and look out for the Post Hotel & residences by Elie Saab, a fashion-forward hotel expected to open next ski season.\nBest time to visit: Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis is a true all-season destination. You can ski from December through April, hike and bike from June through September and enjoy spring flowers and autumn foliage in between.\nCap d'Antibes is having a cultural moment in 2025, making this glamourous corner of the French Riviera worth another look. This year marks the 100th anniversary of F Scott Fitzgerald's arrival on the C\u00f4ted'Azur \u2013 an event that helped shape the Riviera's Jazz Age legacy \u2013 and the literary milestone is drawing renewed attention to the region's artistic significance.\nThe iconic Belles Rives hotel \u2013 Fitzgerald's home for part of the 1920s \u2013 is embracing its storied past with a series of celebratory events. \"The centennial anniversary of Fitzgerald's arrival makes this legendary hotel more relevant than ever,\" says Andria Mitsakos, founder of AMPR, which represents the property.\nBeyond the hotel, Cap d'Antibes hosts the Juan-les-Pins International Jazz Festival in July, when Bastille Day celebrations bring fireworks and festivities to the beaches. Later in the year, visitors can attend the Festival International d'Art Sacr\u00e9, one of the region's oldest music festivals. Bonus: you'll be right in the heart of everything the French Riviera has to offer, from golden beaches and dramatic cliffs to cultural sites such as the Picasso Museum and the Chapelle Matisse.\nBest time to visit: The summer sun beckons A-listers, making it a great time to come for a bit of celebrity-spotting and warm waters for dipping. For cooler temps and fewer crowds, stick to April-June and September-October.\nWhile Italy continues to grapple with overtourism, nearby Slovenia is quietly emerging as a smart alternative, offering spectacular scenery, cultural depth and fewer crowds. With Nova Gorica named a European Capital of Culture for 2025, the timing couldn't be better to explore this captivating nation.\nAt just under 20,720sq km, Slovenia is a \"small but mighty country\", says James Montie, branch manager at Fox World Travel, who's seen growing demand from clients looking for off-the-beaten-path destinations. Slovenia's breathtaking landscapes, \"from Lake Bled's fairytale setting to the underground wonders of Postojna Cave\", are a primary draw, he adds.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 25 best places to travel in 2025\n\u2022 Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms\n\u2022 Here's how to safely visit glacier sites around the world\nIndependent travel advisor Kimberly Denison agrees that Slovenia is poised for a tourism boom and that now is the time to pre-empt the crowds \"Slovenia is a leader in wellness and sustainability, with green-certified cities, boutique eco-lodges and luxurious wellness retreats,\" she says. It also has bonafide stats to back up its green messaging, including that 60% of the country's surface area is forest and it was certified as the world's first green destination in 2016.\nTo explore its glorious landscapes, hike Triglav National Park, home to Slovenia's highest peak, before overnighting at Vila Bled, a historic lakeside retreat that looks like it should be a summer house for royals.\nBest time to visit: The warmer months between May through September offer the greatest opportunities to enjoy outdoor adventures.\nThe Greek Islands are a perennial favourite, but in 2025, it's the mainland that's set to shine \u2013 specifically the outstretched fingers of the Peloponnese. Greece is investing heavily in the region this year, upgrading infrastructure like the Mycenae road network and directing funding towards sustainable agritourism and local olive producers. The result for travellers is easier access, deeper cultural connection and fewer crowds.\nOf the Peloponnese's three peninsulas, Mani \u2013 the rugged middle finger \u2013 stands out. \"Far from the Cycladic island buzz, Mani is Greece's best-kept secret,\" says Mitsakos, who lives in Greece and represents a boutique hotel in Mani. \"This rugged, sun-scorched region is a treasure find for travellers seeking authenticity, serenity and deep cultural resonance.\" Expect cobblestoned villages, pristine beaches and hidden coves, along with \"a deep-rooted history\", she adds. Stay at Pirgos Mavromichali, a restored 18th-Century tower\u00a0turned boutique hotel where whitewashed rooms overlook the bay's turquoise waters.\nElsewhere in the region, travellers can visit Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympics; or relax on Voidokilia Beach on the west coast. Mitsakos also recommends traditional villages like Milea, Rigklia and Exoxhori for their vibrant folk feasts that are reviving local traditions.\nBest time to visit: Greece is packed in the summer, but thanks to the mainland's slightly warmer temperatures, you can get away with a warm-weather break with fewer crowds from April to June and September to October.\nParis had quite the 2024 hosting the Summer Olympics, which means the crowds have thinned and prices dipped back down for 2025. Plus, travel here is now easier than ever; since 1 January 2025, the Paris metro system no longer relies on a complicated zone system with extra fares for the banlieues (suburbs). Today, you can use a single ticket to travel the entire network for up to two hours.\nWhat parts of this renowned city should you prioritise? Paul Holinaty, who specialises in Central and Northern European travel at Goway, says you should hit up the neighbourhoods on the Left Bank of the Seine in particular. \"Saint Germain des Pres and Luxembourg gardens are close enough to the main sites,\" he explains, \"but nicely tucked away, where you can still find really authentic bakeries, local shops and amazing cafe culture \u2013 there's a lot of locals buzzing around the area too.\" The Rive Gauche is also home to plenty of book shops, theatres and elegant boutiques, making the whole area something out of a romantic film. Travellers can also rediscover an old favourite, thanks to Notre Dame reopening its doors at the end of 2024. As for where to stay, the classic H\u00f4tel du Savoir, formerly called the H\u00f4tel Petit Belloy, just reopened post-reno (done by Laune Architecture) in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and is, let's just say, tr\u00e9s chic.\nBest time to visit: Paris is a feast for the senses in all seasons. That said, it's particularly lovely in spring, from April to June, with flowers blooming and longer, sunnier days.\nTourism to Sweden has surged in recent years, driven in part by the rise of the \"coolcation\" trend where travellers seek out more temperate destinations for their summer getaways. With pristine landscapes, clean air and progressive values, the Nordic nation fits the brief perfectly. Even in the height of summer, temperatures rarely break 20C, making it a compelling alternative to the heat of southern Europe.\nWhile many first-timers gravitate to Stockholm, the west coast remains a wilder, more rugged alternative; think granite islands, salty air and seafood straight off the boat. The long summer days and crisp nights create ideal conditions for kayaking, hiking or just soaking up the Nordic light \u2013 minus the crowds and queues of the capital.\nIt's also a fantastic place for sustainability-minded travellers, with Gothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, recently awarded the EU's Mission Label for its ambitious plans to become climate-neutral by 2030. Check in at Hotel Pigalle, a boutique hotel with vintage flair and eco-conscious touches, including bio-cleaning products and locally sourced ingredients. If you're seeking more solitude than the city can offer, the Bohusl\u00e4n archipelago beckons with low-impact adventures, island-hopping and some of the best shellfish you'll ever taste.\nBest time to visit: June-August brings long daylight hours, with sunsets at 22:00 and the best weather for coastal adventures.\nAlbania has long been one of Europe's most underrated destinations, but that's changing fast. Thanks to relaxed visa requirements and expanded international flight routes, the country is quickly rising on the travel radar. In 2024, Albania welcomed a record 11.7 million international visitors, a surge driven in part by the global rise in interest in lesser-known Mediterranean escapes \u2013 which means that now is prime time to see this beautiful country before it books up.\n\"Albania is quickly gaining recognition for its mix of history, unspoiled coastline and emerging food and wine scene,\" says Denison. \"The Unesco-listed town of Gjirokast\u00ebr, the pristine beaches of the Albanian Riviera and the vineyards of Berat create a Mediterranean escape that is still under the radar but rapidly gaining momentum.\"\nNew infrastructure projects are smoothing the journey (fewer potholes are always a plus). Albania is also investing in luxury accommodations, including the Green Coast Hotel near the Unesco World Heritage site of Butrint, which is set to provide unparalleled luxury nestled among the sea caves. \"Albania is poised to become a major player in luxury travel,\" Denison adds.\nWhile hotpots like Ksamil are growing in popularity, travellers who venture just a little beyond the crowds are rewarded with clear turquoise waters that rival the Greek Islands. Inland, the Accursed Mountains' dramatic landscapes draw hikers and adventure seekers to the country's rugged north. Stylish coastal stays like La Brisa Boutique Hotel in Dhermi place you just steps from the sand; while major developments like the new Marriott in the Vlora Marina (expected to open in 2028) signal that this Mediterranean up-and-comer won't stay quiet for long.\nBest time to visit: The summer months are prime time in Albania \u2013 and not yet experiencing the crowds of neighbours like Greece. The warm weather makes for ideal beach, hiking and exploring conditions.\nWant to explore even further?

Both in gameshows, dramas and documentaries and all, of course, all of the radio shows that came out of there as well,\" he said.\nThe former studios were located on Pebble Mill Road in Edgbaston and were opened by Princess Anne on 10 June 1971. It closed in 2004.\nMany shows, including Call My Bluff, Telly Addicts, All Creatures Great & Small and Good Morning With Anne & Nick, were recorded there.\n\"It was a brilliant place to be, and it was very sad that that contracted into a much smaller operation,\" Owen said.\n\"Pebble Mill At One, I think, was the first ever proper daytime programme, and that was really special.\n\"When I first came to Birmingham\u2026 it used to be great to watch Pebble Mill at lunchtime. The fantastic music, helicopters seemed to be landing all around, and there seemed to be explosions and things going on. And big, big names on that show.\"\nPresenters over the years included Bob Langley, Tom Coyne, Marian Foster, Gloria Hunniford, Fern Britton and Alan Titchmarsh.\nOwen met a lot of famous faces while working on Good Morning With Anne & Nick.\n\"We had Margaret Thatcher on and Tony Blair. We had Tom Jones, Elton John \u2013 the list was fantastic. \n\"I did some wonderful filming with Cher. Spent an afternoon on a bed at The Savoy with Cher. Me dressed in leather trying to be raunchy.\n\"So the memories of that are absolutely brilliant.\"\nWhen Owen first started working on BBC Midlands Today in 1997, the regional news programme was based at the Pebble Mill studios.\nIt first aired on 28 September 1964, broadcast from a tiny studio on Broad Street.\nIn 1971, it moved to the newly opened Pebble Mill Studios, and the first episode was presented by Tom Coyne.\nDr Vanessa Jackson, who specialises in TV production at Birmingham City University, started her career at Pebble Mill.\nIt had three studios, but one of its' most famous locations was the bar \u2013 located in the BBC Club.\n\"That was a very important place because many a programme idea was brought to life at the BBC Club. Many a job offer was made. And they used to do a wicked cheese toastie,\" she said.\n\"It's the place where most BBC staff \u2013 after working on a programme like Pebble Mill At One \u2013 would come over the little bridge over the Bourn Brook and make their way into the club, which used to serve a lot of alcohol and very good food.\"\nEarly in his career, Walsall-born Bob Warman, who presented ITV's Central News for 40 years, worked at BBC Radio Birmingham (now BBC Radio WM), which was broadcast from the Pebble Mill studios.\n\"The BBC Club was a pretty desperate place\u2026 When I came for an interview at the BBC with the then station manager \u2013 who was a chap called Jack Johnson, a wonderful Glaswegian man\u2026 He gave me a brief interview in his office and then said, 'Well, it's lunchtime, we better go to the bar.'\n\"We went into this bar which was absolutely nose-to-nose \u2013 it was rammed with people \u2013 all drinking furiously at lunchtime.

Not that Scheffler seems too bothered by creating his own bit of history.\n\"I really don't focus a lot on that stuff,\" he said. \n\"I focus a lot on the preparation and getting ready to play.

Russia declined to comment on Zelensky's revelation on Wednesday.\nHowever, China's foreign ministry said it was \"verifying the relevant situation with the Ukrainian side\", but that it had consistently urged Chinese nationals to steer clear of any armed conflicts.\nIt added that Kyiv's accusation that more Chinese citizens were involved in the fighting was \"groundless\".\nIn a statement on social media platform X, Zelensky said the soldiers were captured in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region with identification documents, including bank cards which had \"personal data\" on them.\nUkraine's forces fought six Chinese soldiers and took two of them prisoner, he said.\nThe post was accompanied by a video showing one of the alleged Chinese captives in handcuffs, speaking Mandarin Chinese and apparently describing a recent battle.\n\"We have information suggesting that there are many more Chinese citizens in the occupier's units than just these two,\" he said.\n\"Russia's involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war in Europe is a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war,\" Zelensky added.\nThe Ukrainian president called for a response \"from the United States, Europe, and all those around the world who want peace\".\nAn investigation is under way and the captives are currently in the custody of Ukraine's security service, he added.\nOn Tuesday, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the reports \"disturbing\".\nShe added that China is a \"major enabler\" of Russia's war in Ukraine, citing its supply of dual-use goods such as navigation equipment, semiconductor chips and jet parts.\nUkraine's foreign minister said that he had summoned China's charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Kyiv to \"demand an explanation\".\nWriting on X, Andrii Sybiha said: \"We strongly condemn Russia's involvement of Chinese citizens in its war of aggression against Ukraine, as well as their participation in combat against Ukrainian forces.\"\nHe added that the move \"puts into question China's declared stance for peace\" and undermines Beijing's credibility as a member of the UN Security Council.\nFrench newspaper Le Monde has previously reported that it identified around 40 accounts on TikTok's sister app, Douyin - which is only available in China - belonging to Chinese individuals who claim to have signed up with the Russian army.\nNorth Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia's war effort against Ukraine, according to Kyiv and Western officials.\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, Zelensky said: \"But there is a difference: North Koreans fought against us on the front in Kursk, the Chinese are fighting on the territory of Ukraine.\"\nIn January Ukraine said it captured two injured North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk Oblast.\nWhile Beijing and Moscow are close political and economic allies, China has attempted to present itself as a neutral party in the conflict and has repeatedly denied supplying Russia with military equipment.\nIn its response on Wednesday, the foreign ministry in Beijing appeared to indicate that if Chinese citizens had been captured by Ukrainian forces then they had been operating in a private capacity.\n\"It is important to emphasise that the Chinese government has consistently urged its citizens to stay away from conflict zones and to avoid involvement in armed conflicts in any form - particularly participation in military actions on any side,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian.\nOne of Russia's chief advantages in the war is numbers. There have been reports of Moscow using \"meat grinder\" tactics to throw huge numbers of soldiers at the front lines and incrementally improve their position.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukraine's territory, mostly in the east.\nRussian drone attacks into Ukraine continued on Tuesday night with strikes injuring 14 people in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, and another two in Kharkiv, in the north-east, local officials said. A number of fires were reported in the two cities.",

Russia declined to comment on Zelensky's revelation on Wednesday.However, China's foreign ministry said it was \"verifying the relevant situation with the Ukrainian side\", but that it had consistently urged Chinese nationals to steer clear of any armed conflicts.It added that Kyiv's accusation that more Chinese citizens were involved in the fighting was \"groundless\".In a statement on social media platform X, Zelensky said the soldiers were captured in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region with identification documents, including bank cards which had \"personal data\" on them.Ukraine's forces fought six Chinese soldiers and took two of them prisoner, he said.The post was accompanied by a video showing one of the alleged Chinese captives in handcuffs, speaking Mandarin Chinese and apparently describing a recent battle. \"Russia's involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war in Europe is a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war,\" Zelensky added.The Ukrainian president called for a response \"from the United States, Europe, and all those around the world who want peace\".An investigation is under way and the captives are currently in the custody of Ukraine's security service, he added.On Tuesday, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the reports \"disturbing\".She added that China is a \"major enabler\" of Russia's war in Ukraine, citing its supply of dual-use goods such as navigation equipment, semiconductor chips and jet parts.Ukraine's foreign minister said that he had summoned China's charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Kyiv to \"demand an explanation\".Writing on X, Andrii Sybiha said: \"We strongly condemn Russia's involvement of Chinese citizens in its war of aggression against Ukraine, as well as their participation in combat against Ukrainian forces. \"He added that the move \"puts into question China's declared stance for peace\" and undermines Beijing's credibility as a member of the UN Security Council.French newspaper Le Monde has previously reported that it identified around 40 accounts on TikTok's sister app, Douyin - which is only available in China - belonging to Chinese individuals who claim to have signed up with the Russian army.North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia's war effort against Ukraine, according to Kyiv and Western officials.What we know about North Korean troops fighting Russia's warAbout 1,000 North Koreans killed fighting Ukraine in Kursk, officials sayIn a press conference on Tuesday, Zelensky said: \"But there is a difference: North Koreans fought against us on the front in Kursk, the Chinese are fighting on the territory of Ukraine. \"In January Ukraine said it captured two injured North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk Oblast.While Beijing and Moscow are close political and economic allies, China has attempted to present itself as a neutral party in the conflict and has repeatedly denied supplying Russia with military equipment.In its response on Wednesday, the foreign ministry in Beijing appeared to indicate that if Chinese citizens had been captured by Ukrainian forces then they had been operating in a private capacity.",

        "article_text": "Liam Delap is the son of former Premier League midfielder Rory Delap and had spells on loan with Hull, Preston and Stoke before joining Ipswich\nIpswich striker Liam Delap will be available for \u00a330m this summer because of a relegation release clause, which will be triggered when his club inevitably returns to the Championship.\nThe 22-year-old is likely to move on, with interest from several Premier League sides after netting 12 goals in 33 games in all competitions in his first full season in the top flight. \nPreviously, multiple sources told BBC Sport that Delap was expected to be available for \u00a340m in the summer - with his previous club Manchester City holding a 'buy-back' fee at that price.\nHowever, sources at Ipswich have since confirmed to BBC Sport that the release clause value decreases by \u00a310m upon relegation. \nThe Suffolk club lost 2-1 in a key relegation match against Wolves last weekend which has left them 12 points away from safety with only seven games left.\nManager Kieran McKenna accepted relegation \"looks more than likely\".\nDelap has delivered a series of impressive performances this season and his release clause looks like good value.\nPaul MacDonald of FootballTransfers.com says Ipswich spent \"significantly\" above Delap's market value of \u00a36.5m last summer, which was another example of City \"extracting maximum value for their excellent youth production line\".\nHe says the \u00a330m release clause is about right for Delap's current market value given his lack of European and senior international experience and the fact he has had one \"breakout\" season.\nThat is, however, balanced against his age and a \"Premier League premium for English forwards\".\nSo which clubs could make a move for him in the summer? \nFrom Championship to England contention - the rise of 'fearless' Delap\nSimon Stone, BBC Sport chief football news reporter:\nThere is no doubt Manchester United will be one of the clubs with a major interest in Delap this summer.\nThe release clause is less than United paid for Rasmus Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee, and Delap has scored more goals than either forward in the Premier League this season. Delap also fits Ruben Amorim's system and the United coach has frequently said his team do not score enough.\nOn that basis, and because talk of a move for Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres is now going cold, a transfer is a no-brainer.\nThe problem for United is the uncertainty over how much money they will have to spend in the summer - they will either earn Champions League qualification via winning the Europa League... or have no European football at all.\nAmorim has said he needs to assess gaps in his squad and where his priorities lie. \nUnited also know there will be a lot of competition for Delap and that could drive the price up beyond \u00a330m, and will drive wages up. It is one of the reasons why they are quite keen to offload high-earners Casemiro and Marcus Rashford this summer, because the comparison with their salaries doesn't help in negotiations either.\nDelap to United could definitely happen. But it is not nailed on.\nBBC Sport football news reporter Nizaar Kinsella:\nChelsea sources have signalled interest in Delap in recent months. \nManager Enzo Maresca worked with him in Manchester City's academy team. Similarly, so did influential recruiter Joe Shields and new academy technical director Glenn van der Kraan. \nThose personal relationships make the Stamford Bridge club serious contenders for his signature, but they are reportedly also interested in RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Sporting's Gyokeres. \nThe new Chelsea regime are also known to prefer signing players that have release clauses written into their contracts.\nSimon Stone, BBC Sport chief football news reporter:\nCity had a \u00a340m buy-back agreement on Delap when they sold him to Ipswich last summer.\nThey also have a 20% sell-on clause on any profit Ipswich make beyond the \u00a320m they initially spent.\nWith Erling Haaland tied to a contract that does not expire until 2034, Omar Marmoush impressing since his winter arrival from Eintracht Frankfurt and Jeremy Doku and Savinho both in favour with Pep Guardiola this season in wide positions, it does not appear City have room for Delap in a way that would offer regular starts, which surely has to be a key selling point.\nIn addition, even with five Champions League spots for English teams, it is not certain City will be in Europe's top competition next season, which is a factor.\nOn that basis City would be unlikely to make a move, although, with a new technical director in Hugo Viana and a summer rebuild on the cards, that does bring an element of the unknown.\nBBC Sport pundit Chris Sutton:\nFor \u00a330m, of course a lot of big teams will be looking at him.\nIt would be a risk going to United with the lack of creativity that they have, but he would be an upgrade on what they have got.\nCompared to Chelsea's main striker, Nicolas Jackson, he is far more physical. He can still run in behind defences but is far more of an all-rounder. Part of the game which I think he could improve is aerially, considering he is 6ft 1in (1.85m).\nWhat I really like is that he has got that sort of swagger about him, and that attitude where he knows he is good, which you need at the bigger clubs.\nHe is too good for Ipswich. I don't want to upset their fans but he was a good signing and a brilliant bit of business for them, and they have enjoyed watching him play. Nobody is going to begrudge him leaving to go to a bigger club.\nIf he went to somewhere like Chelsea or Manchester United then he could be another player who bites Pep in the backside, like Cole Palmer did.\nBut going back to City behind other forwards is not going to help his development, or his England chances.\nArsenal have been linked heavily with Sesko and Gyokeres but not Delap. \nWest Ham are known to want a striker in the summer while Aston Villa and Newcastle could emerge as suitors.\nVilla sold striker Jhon Duran to Al-Nassr in January but signed Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United as a replacement. \nNewcastle striker Callum Wilson is out of contract in the summer and Alexander Isak is continually linked with a move away, despite sources at St James' Park insisting he is not for sale. \nMuch could also come down to the PSR positions of the various clubs and which teams gain the lucrative windfall for qualifying for the Champions League next season. \nLatest Ipswich Town news, analysis and fan views\nGet Ipswich news notifications",

        "article_text": "Right from the start, season three of Mike White's Thailand-set one percenter drama was beset by criticism and debate \u2013 where will the series go from here?\nWithin seconds of the highly anticipated final episode of The White Lotus\u2019s season three ending on Sunday evening, the reactions and reviews for the 83-min closer were in. The viewers might as well have been talking about two different shows. \"This was the best season finale so far in The White Lotus universe,\" one person on X commented, while another agreed: \"That episode was a work of art.\" However, others felt \"the ending was a huge flop \u2013 built up several plot lines all series to abruptly end them in 20 minutes with no reflection,\" with another saying the finale \"stinks\u2026 way too long, very boring\". \nThese divisive opinions are reflective of the season as a whole, and were also felt by the critics. Was the third outing of creator Mike White's one-percenter holiday murder-mystery \u2013 set previously in luxury resorts in Hawaii, Sicily and, most recently, Koh Samui, Thailand \u2013 worthy of what Brian Tallerico of Roger Ebert called his \"favourite season yet\"? Or did the series, as the Boston Globe's Steven Nguyen Scaife put it, have \"less to say than ever\u2026 it's comfort food masquerading as social critique\"?\nIt was always going to be a tricky feat for White to pull off mass adoration for a third time. The White Lotus, which debuted in 2021, previously won 15 Emmys and two Golden Globes. It marked a comeback role for Jennifer Coolidge, often credited as White's muse, and who portrayed the naive heiress Tanya McQuoid for the first two seasons. The role earned her two Emmys and a Golden Globe, as well as becoming a fan-favourite. But White had pulled the rug out from viewers at the end of season two, killing off Coolidge's much-loved character, leaving fans unsteady and unsure of where a third series would take them \u2013 and if it would still have the same impact.\u00a0\nThe trouble with the new series can perhaps be traced back to the opening seconds of season three back in February, when disappointed fans noted that not only was the new theme tune not \"a bop\", but it failed to contain the traditional \"wooo-loo-looos\" sounds of the previous two series. It may have been a minor issue, but was integral to the whole experience, some viewers believed.\u00a0\nJust last week, The White Lotus composer, Crist\u00f3bal Tapia de Veer, revealed to The The New York Times that he had quit the show due to \"hysterical\" conversations with the show's producers, adding: \"I texted the producer and I told him that it would be great to, at some point, give them the longer version with the ooh-loo-loo-loos, because people will explode if they realise that it was going there anyway. He thought it was a good idea. But then Mike cut that \u2013 he wasn't happy about that. At that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think.\"\nAlongside this off-set drama, a common complaint about this season was that White's traditional slow-burn of storytelling was too\u2026 slow. The London Evening Standard called it \"agonisingly slow\". Meanwhile, given the star-power of the cast, several characters such as Blackpink's Lalisa Manobal's staff member Mook or The Zone of Interest's Christian Friedel as the resort manager \u2013 and aspiring singer \u2013 Fabian, felt severely underused and underdeveloped.\nFans waiting for a payoff in the finale were disappointed by nothing turning up. \"Manobal, and Christian Friedel, were never really given the chance to shine \u2013 and the show felt poorer for it,\" said the Evening Standard. Other long, drawn-out storylines, such as Jason Isaacs' dodgy financial-dealing dad, Tim Ratliff, attempting to kill his family, were never revealed to his family, sadly depriving viewers of the moment when the snobbish Victoria Ratliff (Parker Posey) discovers they were poor.\nWhite himself seemed to foreshadow some of this criticism. \"It isn't exactly a crowd-pleaser,\" he told The New Yorker. \"I don't know what it is, but we'll see.\" And at the beginning of the final episode, the Buddhist monk, Luang Por Teera, is shown saying to his students: \"There is no resolution to life's questions. It is easier to be patient once we finally accept there is no resolution.\"\nHad the show become a victim of its own success? As the series' feverish Reddit page grew in numbers, so did the fandom's theories, speculations and predictions. This was presumably not something the show was set up for in its debut season, but was something that White appeared to play into across the second and third series: planting hints and suggestions of what might come to pass later in the show, but also red herrings to throw people off the scent again.\u00a0\nWhile some fans may arguably have spoiled the experience for themselves by correctly predicting plot twists in this series \u2013 the slightly trope-y revelation of someone's parentage; who was going to die \u2013 others may have felt frustrated, and that White overplayed his hand with too many false moments that culminated in ultimately inconsequential storylines or characters.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The White Lotus s3 review: 'Feels flabby and elongated'\n\u2022 The White Lotus and hidden codes of male nudity on screen\n\u2022 The show that skewers the super-rich\nHowever, some aspects of this series were roundly agreed to be spectacular. The shock return of the series villain, Greg (Jon Gries), which managed to remain a secret until the first episode aired, was a genuine jump scare rare in contemporary television; and a surprise cameo \u2013 and an even more shocking monologue \u2013 by Sam Rockwell as Frank, a friend of Rick's (Walton Goggins) who is in recovery, will mark the series as unforgettable.\nWhite's writing and sharp talent for capturing humanity it all its gore and glory also shone through again. In the final episode, a heartfelt speech by Laurie (Carrie Coon) to her frenemies; noting how the passing of time made her appreciative of their relationship in her life; to Belinda's (Natasha Rothwell) character arc \u2013 and White's observation that for the right amount of money, we're all likely to sell out our morals.\nIt was these strengths \u2013 and arguably the more \"shock\" storylines like the incest brothers threesome; or all the full-frontal penis shots \u2013 that meant that even if the show was divisive, it was still pulling the viewers in. According to an HBO spokesperson in the New York Times: \"The second season of The White Lotus, which debuted in October 2022, shot up to more than 15 million viewers, and this season is on track to have at least 18 million\", making it one of HBO's most popular shows of all time.\u00a0\nAnd, as some critics have also pointed out, even if this third season of The White Lotus wasn't at its best, \"bad\" The White Lotus is appointment TV, and still heads and shoulders above a lot of other television out there. \"It is better in its third gear than many dramas are in full throttle,\" commented Carol Midgley from The Times.\u00a0\nThere will now likely be debate over whether White should have agreed to continue with a fourth series of The White Lotus \u2013 which was confirmed by HBO before season three began \u2013 and speculation as to its new location and new cast. White has shown that he still has the power to draw in the audiences; but will the destination be worth another journey? \u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "'Red and green should never be seen', apparently - but Bernhard Langer was delighted to pair his red polo shirt with the iconic Green Jacket in 1985\nWhen Tiger Woods romped to his first Masters title in 1997, he did so wearing a red top that quickly became established as his iconic Sunday colour.\nBut the American, who would go on to win five times at Augusta National, was not the first to make the fashion faux pas of pairing a red polo shirt with the Green Jacket.\nForty years ago this weekend, Bernhard Langer set the tone as he marched to the first of his two Masters victories - he even wore red trousers, too.\n\"I always tease Tiger,\" said the 67-year-old, who was close to tears as he talked about playing in his 41st and final Masters this week.\n\"See, I was the one wearing a red shirt first; you came later.\" \nLanger has previously joked that he \"looked like a Christmas tree\" when he donned the famous Green Jacket for the first time in 1985.\n\nMasters - dates, tee times, favourites & how to follow on the BBC\n'McIlroy's Masters memories must be turned into a positive'\nCabrera wins on eve of Masters return after time in prison\nHis final Masters was supposed to be last year but a snapped Achilles tendon - an injury suffered while playing pickleball - meant the German couldn't play. So he delayed saying farewell to a place that means so much to him.\n\"They're the two most important wins in my career,\" he said of his 1985 and 1993 victories at Augusta, which are his sole major triumphs.\n\"It's emotional. You can tell already my voice is breaking a bit just realising it's going to be my last competitive Masters.\"\nLanger has conceded for many years that he no longer has the game to compete at Augusta; three missed cuts in his past three Masters are testament to that.\n\"The course is just getting too long and I'm getting shorter and shorter,\" he said. \n\"I'm hitting hybrids [into greens] where the other kids are hitting nine-irons, maybe even wedges. So I knew I wasn't going to be in contention anymore.\n\"A few years back I asked the chairman of the club, 'is there a time limit? Do we age out when we're 60?'. He said, 'no, you will know when it's time to quit, it's totally up to you'.\n\"It is time to quit.\"\nLyle, Langer, Woosnam, Olazabal, Ballesteros and Faldo were victorious at Augusta National in an extraordinary era of success for European golf\nLanger was runner-up at The Open twice and third on three occasions in a career that promised more major success.\nThat he was unable to add a major other than his two at Augusta only intensifies his link to this fabled corner of Georgia.\nIn 40 appearances, he has made the cut 27 times and finished inside the top 10 nine times.\n\"It's been an incredible journey, for a young man born in a village of 800 people [in Bavaria, southern Germany], where golf was nothing, to make it here,\" he said.\n\"To get an invitation to play the Masters when it was extremely difficult for European or international players to get one, and then to win the Masters on the third go was just a dream come true.\"\nHe was just the third non-American winner, following in the footsteps of South Africa's three-time champion Gary Player and Seve Ballesteros of Spain, who won twice. \nHis win cemented belief among Europeans that success could be achieved at Augusta.\nBallesteros paved the way with his victories in 1980 and 1983, before Langer won his first two years later. \nThen Scotland's Sandy Lyle, England's Nick Faldo (twice) Wales' Ian Woosnam, Langer again and Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal collected six of seven titles from 1988.\nLanger's debut was in 1982, two years after Ballesteros had broken the glass ceiling. \nThe German's initial experience was hardly noteworthy. He shot 77 and 78 to miss the halfway cut by one stroke after three-putting 11 times in 36 holes on unfamiliar greens that were too slick for a naive 24-year-old.\n\"Coming here the first time, driving down Magnolia Lane, seeing this place for the first time was an eye-opener,\" he said. \n\"I had never seen a golf course manicured like this or a tournament run as efficiently as this has been.\"\nBy the time Langer won his second title in 1993, he was married with three children\nHe vowed to come back better prepared and when he returned two years later he made it through to the weekend - the first of an incredible run of 19 successive Masters that Langer would play all four rounds.\nHis victory 12 months later was secured with a classic back-nine Augusta charge. He birdied four out of six holes from the 12th as he overturned a three-shot deficit to Curtis Strange, who dropped shots on three of his final five holes.\nLanger bogeyed the 18th but still beat Strange, Ray Floyd and his playing partner Ballesteros by two shots.\nHe made a solid defence of his title in 1986 and briefly shared the lead in the final round before Jack Nicklaus produced a back nine for the ages to clinch his record-extending sixth Green Jacket and 18th major title.\nThat week was also memorable for witnessing the first time a world ranking was published, and it was Langer who had the honour of topping the inaugural list.\nHe was becoming something of an Augusta specialist and the love affair strengthened with two more top 10s before he claimed his second victory in 1993.\nLanger was challenged by unheralded American Dan Forsman in the final round. \nForsman was one shot behind the German when he teed off on the notoriously tricky par-three 12th. He dumped two balls in the water, walked off with a quadruple-bogey seven and was barely heard of again.\nIn contrast, Langer's name continued to pepper the leaderboards at Augusta, with top 10s in 1997, 2001 and 2004. \nHe finished joint eighth at the age of 56 in 2014 and held the record for the oldest player to make the cut - at the age of 63 in 2020 - until Fred Couples eclipsed that in 2023.\nThis is Langer's final Masters but not the end of competitive golf for the former Ryder Cup captain, who looks as fit as he did in his pomp.\nHe shows no signs of slowing down on the PGA Tour Champions - the US-based seniors tour - and has racked up at least one victory a year since joining the circuit in 2007 when he turned 50. \nHe has won 12 majors among 47 senior victories - both of which are records.\nThis week he is back among the game's youthful elite though, and will seek to end his Masters career with the same controlled elegance with which he has played throughout his career.\nHe will not contend for the title. That is clear. Instead, the question is whether his Masters career ends after round two on Friday, or if he defies his own expectations and makes the cut.\n\"After four decades it's going to be bittersweet,\" he said.\n\"When I'm inside the ropes, my mind switches to being a competitor, play golf and take care of the task in front of me. \n\"But I might get a bit emotional looking around, seeing my family, my kids, my grandkids, my brother and other friends that are going to be supporting me this week.\n\"I love the Masters more than any tournament in the world. I'm expecting it to be very difficult emotionally.\"",

Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"\nIn a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.\nEmber is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling. \nBut this hasn't happened yet due to increasing global demand for electricity. \nCheap and relatively easy to install, for the twentieth year in a row solar is the fastest growing electricity source. According to Ember, the amount generated by solar panels has doubled every three years since 2012.\nChina continues to dominate the growth of solar with more than half of the increase taking place there. India's solar capacity doubled between 2023 and 2024.\nThough it is growing fast, solar remains a relatively small part of the global energy mix contributing just under 7% of global supply \u2013 that's the same as powering the entire country of India. \nWind contributes just over 8%, with hydropower contributing 14% making it the largest source of clean energy. Both hydro-electric and nuclear power (9%) are growing much more slowly than wind and solar.\nThe report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.\nThe big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy. \nThat means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.\nAccording to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024. \nThis was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.\nIn the last five years, fast-growing Asian economies, in particular India and China, have continued expanding their use of fossil fuels to meet rapidly rising demand for electricity.

The other youngest players to appear in the Premier League are Harvey Elliott who played for Fulham at 16 years and 30 days old, Matthew Briggs who played for Fulham at 16 years 68 days, Isaiah Brown who represented West Brom at 16 years 117 days, and Aaron Lennon who was 16 years 129 days when he played for Leeds.An eighth-straight league defeat without scoring leaves Leicester 19th in the table and 15 points adrift of safety with seven games remaining.Related topicsLeicester CityPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished31 January \"You could see glimpses of his great qualities. \"Monga will turn 16 on 10 July and will be able to sign his first professional contract when he turns 17 in 2026.Monga has largely played for Leicester's Under-18s and Under-23s this season, while also making three appearances in the Football League Trophy.He was an unused substitute in the Foxes' 2-1 FA Cup fourth round defeat by Manchester United in February.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect \u2013 and outside China, no other region has been hit as hard as South East Asia.\nNear the top of the list are Vietnam and Cambodia which have been hit by some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49%.  Further down are Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Malaysia (24%). The Philippines gets a tariff of 17%, and Singapore of 10%.\nThis is a huge blow for a region highly dependent on exports. Its widely admired economic development over the past three decades has largely been driven by its success in selling its products to the rest of the world, in particular to the US. \nExports to the US contribute around 30% of Vietnam's GDP, and 25% of Cambodia's.\nThat growth story is now imperilled by the punitive measures being imposed in Washington.\nThe longer-term impact of these tariffs, assuming they stay in place, will vary, but will certainly pose big challenges to the governments of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia in particular.\nVietnam's \"bamboo diplomacy\", where it attempts to be friends with everyone and balance ties with both China and the US, will now be tested.\nUnder the leadership of the new Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam, Vietnam has embarked on an ambitious plan to build an upper-income, knowledge-and-tech-based economy by the year 2045. It has been aiming for annual growth rates in excess of 8%.\nExporting more to the US, already its biggest market, was central to that plan.\nIt was also the main reason why Vietnam agreed to elevate their relationship to that of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023.\nThe Communist Party, which tolerates little dissent and has no formal political opposition, depends on its economic pledges for its legitimacy. Already viewed by many economists as too ambitious, these will now be even harder to meet.\nThailand depends on US exports less than Vietnam \u2013 under 10% of GDP \u2013 but the Thai economy is in much worse shape, having underperformed for the past decade. The Thai government is trying to find ways to lift economic growth, most recently attempting but failing to legalise gambling, and these tariffs are another economic blow it cannot afford.\nFor Cambodia, the tariffs pose perhaps the greatest political threat in the region.\nThe government of Hun Manet has proved just as authoritarian as that of his father Hun Sen, whom he succeeded two years ago, but it is vulnerable.\nKeeping the Hun family's hold on power has required offering rival clans in Cambodia economic privileges like monopolies or land concessions, but this has helped create a glut of property developments, which are no longer selling, and a mass of grievances over land expropriations.\nThe garment sector, which employs 750,000 people, has been a crucial social safety valve, giving steady incomes to Cambodia's poorest. Thousands of those jobs are now likely to be lost as a result of President Trump's tariffs.\nUnlike China, which has hit back with its own levies, the official message from governments in South East Asia is don't panic, don't retaliate, but negotiate.\nVietnam has dispatched deputy prime minister Ho Duc Phoc to Washington to plead his country's case, and has offered to eliminate all tariffs on US imports. Thailand plans to send its finance minister to make a similar appeal, and has offered to reduce its tariffs and buy more American products, like food and aircraft. \nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is also heading to Washington, though with  exports to the US making up only 11% of Malaysia's total, his country is less affected than some of its neighbours. \nHowever, the Trump administration appears to be in no mood to compromise.\nPeter Navarro, President Trump's senior counsellor on trade and manufacturing and one of the main thinkers behind the new policy, said in interviews on Monday that Vietnam's offer of zero tariffs was meaningless, because it would not address the deficit in trade where Vietnam sells $15 worth of goods to the US for every $1 it buys.\nHe accused Vietnam of keeping multiple non-tariff barriers to US imports, and said that one-third of all Vietnamese exports to the US were actually Chinese products, trans-shipped through Vietnam.\nThe proportion of Vietnamese exports which are being made or trans-shipped there to avoid US tariffs on China is difficult to assess, but detailed trade studies put it at between 7% and 16%, not one-third.\nLike Vietnam, the government of Cambodia has appealed to the US to postpone the tariffs while it attempts to negotiate.\nThe local American Chamber of Commerce has called for the 49% tariffs to be dropped, making the point that the Cambodian garment industry, the country's biggest employer, will be badly affected, but that no tariff level, however high, will see clothing and footwear manufacturing return to the US.\nPerhaps the most perverse tariff rate is the 44% applied to Myanmar, a country mired in a civil war, which has no capacity to buy more US goods.\nUS exports make up only a small proportion of Myanmar's GDP, less than 1%.\nBut as in Cambodia, that sector, mainly garments, is one of the few that provides a steady income to poor families in Myanmar's cities.\nIn a supreme irony,  Trump has until now been a popular figure in this region.\nHe has been widely admired in Vietnam for his tough, transactional approach to foreign policy, and Cambodia's former strongman Hun Sen, still the main power behind the scenes, has long sought a close personal relationship with the US president, proudly posting selfies with him at their first meeting in 2017.\nOnly last month Cambodia was praising  Trump for shutting down the US media networks Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, which often carried the views of Cambodian dissidents.\nNow Cambodia, like so many of its neighbours, finds itself in a long line of supplicants pleading with him to ease their tariff burden.",

        "article_text": "It's having a moment with celebrities, fashionistas and Gen Z. But wearing any kind of fur, from vintage to synthetic, poses some difficult questions. Could a new plant-based faux fur be the way forward?\nFrom Tory Burch in New York and Simone Rocha in London, to Fendi in Milan and Miu Miu in Paris, fur dominated the autumn/winter 2025-26 catwalks. And celebrities matched the runways, with Hailey Bieber, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Taylor Swift and Rihanna all spending the start of the year wrapped up in faux and vintage fur coats.\nThe last time fur hit the headlines was in 2017, when Gucci pledged to go fur-free, influencing a host of designer brands to follow suit. The move was welcomed by animal rights campaigners, but what followed was the scaling of a new problem: much of the real fur has been replaced by synthetic alternatives that are derived from fossil fuels. Given the tensions around animal welfare and the environment, why is fur now firmly back in fashion?\nIt began in early 2024 with the arrival of the mob wife aesthetic, an ostentatious, glamorous response to the understated, minimalist trend that preceded it: stealth wealth. \"Reviving historical looks for contemporary wear is a natural part of the fashion cycle. It's escapism, and who doesn't want some of that?\" says Natascha Radclyffe-Thomas, associate professor, MBA fashion business and entrepreneurship, at Ravensbourne University, London. \"I was in the room when [former CEO] Marco Bizzarri announced Gucci would no longer use animal fur in its collections, and remember what an amazing shift this was for an Italian luxury brand where fur was such a prevalent material. But the topic of faux fur is such a tricky one, too.\"\nRadclyffe-Thomas adds that, since designer labels' decision to ban real fur from their collections, the faux-fur market has evolved from the early days of \"fun\" fur \u2013 low cost, often in bright colours that didn't attempt to imitate the real thing \u2013 to a new level of quality where most consumers wouldn't know the difference between real and fake.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe production of fossil fuel-based fabrics continues to rise globally, with polyester the most common, accounting for 57% of all fibre production. Even clothing made from recycled polyester is problematic because the model isn't circular. The vast majority is made using plastic bottles \u2013\u00a0 not old textiles \u2013 which means that it can't be recycled again, and will most likely end up in landfill at some point.\nOne way to keep faux fur out of landfill \u2013\u00a0 or delay its final destination \u2013 is to keep it in circulation. At fashion rental company By Rotation, the rental of faux fur and wool coats has been increasing since even before the recent catwalk shows. London label Charlotte Simone \u2013\u00a0 whose faux fur coats have been worn by Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa and Madonna \u2013 is the third most rented brand across coats and jackets. \"Higher quality, well-made faux fur, especially from designer brands, tends to last longer, meaning it's more likely to be passed down, resold or rented rather than discarded,\" By Rotation founder and CEO, Eshita Kabra-Davies, tells the BBC.\nThe global second hand clothing market is expected to reach $367bn by 2029, with a record number of shoppers having bought pre-loved clothes in 2024. This year, since the autumn/winter 2025-26 collections were shown, searches for both real and faux fur have spiked at rental platforms and online retailers.\u00a0\nHolly Watkins, owner of vintage boutique One Scoop Store in north London, says that in the past few years she has seen a considerable shift away from selling real fur to fake alternatives, in response to changing tastes and demands from her customers. \"I only sell real fur if it's a super-special vintage piece which I can't say no to, or has a detachable collar or trim,\" she tells the BBC. \"Personally, I don't have a problem with old [real] fur \u2013 it's better to prolong its life than send it to landfill. I have more of a problem with polyester, in that it will never biodegrade.\"\nBut from conversations with vintage dealers in west London\u00a0\u2013 home to the likes of Portobello market \u2013 Watkins says that many stores have never stopped selling real fur, both old and new, with younger shoppers helping to drive the trend.\u00a0\n\"Fashion turned on fur. Young customers want more\" was the headline of a recent Wall Street Journal article \u2013 and the consensus does seem to be that Gen Z is leading the revival of vintage fur. Madison Avenue Furs, the largest buyer of pre-owned fur in the US, reports a significant uplift in sales, particularly of pre-owned pieces. \"We saw college students coming in to buy fur, which we haven't seen in years,\" Larry Cowit, owner of Madison Avenue Furs, tells the BBC. \"The vintage furs against the new furs was a concern for many of the younger buyers and \u2013 ethically \u2013 they were comfortable with vintage.\"\nCustomers are buying vintage furs across the board, says Cowit, including mink, fox and beaver in oversized silhouettes \u2013 from the likes of Christian Dior, Fendi, Oscar de la Renta, Prada and YSL. \"Once these brands come in, they go rather quickly.\"\nOn the catwalks at the recent fashion weeks, much of the fur was faux, although among the headlines at Paris Fashion Week was a mink coat made from real vintage fur at Gabriela Hearst, a designer label that positions itself as \"luxury with a conscience\".\nAnimal rights campaigners don't accept the vintage argument. \"Regardless of when the damage was done, vintage fur remains clothing made from the skin of a needlessly killed and caged animal,\" says Emma H\u00e5kansson, founder of Collective Fashion Justice. \"It is an ongoing symbol of human supremacy over other animals, and we should not accept that in the 21st Century when we have myriad other options without animal exploitation, wildlife killing or factory farming.\"\nAmong the new-generation alternatives to fossil-fuel-made fur and real animal skin is Savian, a 100% plant-based fur made from nettle, flax and hemp sourced from Europe and produced in Italy. Developed by material science company BioFluff, Savian launched in the form of a longline coat by Stella McCartney during COP28 in November 2023, and was later used in 2024 by Danish fashion brand Ganni to create a collection of bags for Copenhagen Fashion Week.\n\"We are working with several fashion brands across the luxury, contemporary and accessible markets to develop materials that are suited to their needs,\" BioFluff co-founder Roni Gamzon tells the BBC, adding that cost remains a challenge to scaling up the adoption of new-gen materials. \"So many brands have built a reliance on low-cost synthetic materials manufactured at mass in the Far East, making it impossible for us to compete purely on pricing.\"\nBioFluff is part of La Maison des Startups, a programme from LVMH to help accelerate the implementation of new solutions within its portfolio of brands, which includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi and C\u00e9line. Conversely, LVMH also helps to fund The International Fur Federation, paying \u20ac300,000 ($318,000) for Furmark membership, a global certification and traceability system for real fur.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Ten items in your wardrobe is enough \u2013 here's why\n\u2022 The Indigenous-American supermodel bringing change\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\nThe argument that synthetic fur has a higher environmental impact than real fur is questioned by a 2013 scientific study, which compared the impact of natural mink fur coats against that of faux fur coats, and found that the production of natural mink fur had the highest climate impact. When this study is considered alongside two other facts \u2013 approximately 100 million animals are killed for their fur and more than 100 billion items of clothing are produced globally each year (with 65% ending up in landfill within 12 months) \u2013 is the production of new fur clothing ever justified?\nCowit, who continues to sell both new and vintage furs, believes it's up to customers to make the choice, while Radclyffe-Thomas says her anti-real-fur views were challenged when she worked in the US and met people for whom hunting and trapping were part of their traditions.\n\"For many Indigenous cultures, fur and animal skins are part of a cultural heritage used for ceremonial and everyday dress, and I do think that there is an argument for respecting this,\" she says, before recalling her early student days where she learnt sewing techniques from a furrier. \"Those classes brought home to me the reality of the number of animals killed for clothing, and pretty much cemented my personal view: I have never considered buying real fur.\"\nThree Things to Help Heal the Planet by Ana Santi is published by Welbeck Balance.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

He did not give evidence.\nThe prince's case is challenging the way the Royal and VIP Executive Committee, known as Ravec, took the decision on his security arrangements after he stepped down from being a working royal in 2020.\nIn written submissions to the court today, his barrister said the duke and his wife \"felt forced to step back from the role of full time official working members of the Royal Family as they considered they were not being protected by the institution\".\nThe duke's security in the UK is currently decided on a case-by-case basis, the same way as the country's other high-profile visitors.\nPrince Harry has previously said that the safety of his family, with whom he moved to California in 2020, was at the heart of the case.\n\"The UK is central to the heritage of my children,\" he told the High Court in December 2023, adding that he wanted them to feel at home here. \"That cannot happen if it's not possible to keep them safe.\"\nRegarding his current security arrangements in the UK, Ms Fatima told the court he does not accept that \"bespoke\" means \"better\".\nBecause the Home Office has legal responsibility for Ravec's decisions, it is opposing the appeal on its behalf.\nMr Eadie, representing the Home Office, said the previous judge could accept \"that the bespoke process was better suited\" to Harry's circumstances.\nHe said it was \"important to emphasise\" that the security previously given to the prince had not been fully revoked.\nHe said, instead, it had been decided that the security \"would not be provided on the same basis as before\" due to the duke's \"change of status\" and his moving abroad.\nMs Fatima told the court on Tuesday that Ravec had not followed its own standard procedures, because it chose to downgrade his security without having expert analysis of the risks he faced.\nShe argued that the previous judge was wrong to have concluded that the committee could make decisions without such analysis.\nShe also said the prince's case was not that he should \"automatically be entitled to the same protection as he was previously given\".\nRather, Ms Fatima said, his legal submissions argued that he should have been told how the decisions about his security were being made.\nPrince Harry claimed he had not been given the chance to make his own case or see risk assessments that might have been carried out.\nHe also referenced security incidents that have happened since his security was downgraded.\nThese include al-Qaeda calling for the prince to be murdered in 2020, and a \"dangerous car pursuit with paparazzi\" in New York in 2023.\nIn written submissions, Mr Eadie said the prince's appeal involved \"a continued failure to see the wood for the trees\".\nHe added that Prince Harry's argument was based on \"only reading small parts\" of the evidence and the previous judgement, and doing so \"out of context and ignoring the totality of the picture\".\nMr Eadie said Ravec had treated the claimant \"in a bespoke manner\", adding: \"He is no longer a member of the cohort of individuals whose security position remains under regular review by Ravec.\"\nSir James added: \"This approach was at all times a matter for the expert judgment of Ravec and the judge was right to find that it was lawful.\"\nIn 2023, Prince Harry also lost a legal challenge in his bid to be allowed to make private payments for police protection.\nWhile most of the proceedings are set to be held in open court, confidential information about security arrangements and threat levels will be heard in private.\nThe two-day hearing will continue on Wednesday.

We've got so much to be proud of.\"\nUniversal's Orlando resort in Florida brought in 9.75 million visitors in 2023, while its Hollywood resort saw 9.66 million the same year - according to the Theme Index Report.\nIn 2016, NBCUniversal agreed to a seven-year deal with Warner Bros. That meant it had television rights to show the Harry Potter films and the Fantastic Beasts franchise.\nThe prime minister said the theme park would create jobs across construction, artificial intelligence and tourism.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said the government had agreed with Universal that British steel would be used \"where possible\" on the project.\n\"That's the case with HS2, with Heathrow, and with this private investment here in Bedfordshire,\" she said.\nAccording to plans from Universal Destinations & Experiences, the UK site would include a theme park, a 500-room hotel and a retail complex.\nUniversal has already bought 476 acres for the project, but could buy more land to increase the plot to about 700 acres - which would improve transport links.\nResidents living in surrounding villages have responded positively to the plans, though some are concerned infrastructure will not be enough to support the amount of expected visitors.\nUniversal said it had surveyed more than 6,000 local people and organisations, and 92% of those supported the project.\nUniversal said it would make upgrades to the Wixams railway station and build a new station on the East West Rail line near the resort.\nIt would also add dedicated slip roads to the A421, which flooded in October after heavy rainfall.\nOn Thursday, Secretary of State for Transport Heidi Alexander approved expansion plans at the nearby London Luton Airport.\nUniversal previously described the Bedford site as \"an ideal location with convenient, fast rail links to London and London Luton Airport\". \nNandy also said the government's commitment to improve local transport infrastructure had helped secure the deal with Universal.\nShadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the previous Conservative administration worked closely with Universal Studios to \"secure the land\" and \"bring forward the plans\".\n\"We're pleased that, despite Labour's economic mismanagement, Universal Studios has committed to investing in Bedfordshire,\" he added.\nMike Cavanagh, the president of Comcast Corporation, which owns Universal, said he was excited to expand the parks brand into Europe.\nThe company said it would work with Bedford Borough Council on the project.\nThe local authority was one of six councils to support the plans last year, alongside Central Bedfordshire, Luton, Milton Keynes, north Northamptonshire and west Northamptonshire councils.\nMayor of Bedford Tom Wootton told BBC Breakfast it was the \"best news\" for the town in \"a very long time\".\n\"Some of the brightest and most fantastic people at Universal are working on [the infrastructure],\" he said.\nBedford residents had mixed thoughts on the plans when asked on Wednesday.\nMargaret Wilson, 85, from Elstow, said she would not visit the theme park but believed her grandsons, aged 19 and 16, would enjoy it.\nBut she said: \"It will be four years until anything is built. Who knows what will happen in four years?\"\nMaria Perez, a warehouse worker in the area, said the theme park would be \"really great\" for families and young people.\n\"It will be good for the economy, for the town and for the people. People will invest more.\"\nShe said it would not be good for rent prices, but overall felt it would be positive for Bedford.\nJagdeep Singh is a 36-year-old business change analyst from Kempston.\nWhile he believed the theme park would drive businesses and bring jobs, he feared the number of visitors could have a negative effect.\n\"I worried a bit about traffic on the bypass - what's going to happen to our hospitals if there's any accidents?\" he added.\nThe proposals remain subject to a planning decision from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.\nExperts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.\nPassengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.\nThe digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.\nLying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.\nThis would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.\nAll died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.\n\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"\nA new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.\nIt takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.\n\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.\nThe simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.\nTitanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded. \nBut the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.\n\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.\n\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"\nUnfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.\nThe human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.\nPersonal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.\nThe scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.\n\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.\"",

He used his name, contacts and the ability to speak fluent English to raise the awareness of the plight of Karabakh Armenians.\n\"My father did more interviews with international media in three months than all the other Nagorno-Karabakh presidents in 30 years. The amount of attention this was receiving from the Western media clearly irritated Azerbaijan,\" his son David Vardanyan told the BBC.\nThere had been speculation that Vardanyan had moved there to avoid international sanctions imposed on Russia's billionaires with links to the Kremlin.\nThe government in Baku considered his decision to take up the position as illegal.\nHis son insists he was driven by the desire to help local Armenians.\n\"We had an argument on our last family holiday, I was completely against his decision, which was putting the entire family at risk.

I think none is true,\" he says.\nIn September 2023 Azerbaijan launched a military operation and took control of the entire territory in 24 hours.\nNagorno-Karabakh's leaders capitulated and more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians were forced to leave their homes.\nVardanyan was arrested by Azerbaijani authorities as he joined a mass exodus to Armenia.\nMuch of his time since has been spent in solitary confinement, his family says.\nHe has already been on hunger strike twice, protesting at what he has called a lack of proper judicial process, amid allegations of torture.\nFifteen other former Karabakh leaders are also being tried in Baku's military court for alleged war crimes committed since the late 1980s.\nVardanyan has been dealt with separately, but many in Armenia see all the cases as show trials.\nOnly the main Azerbaijani state TV channel has been allowed to film the trials.\nAzerbaijan insists it is complying with international legal standards, and that it has a responsibility to hold to account those suspected of having committed war crimes.\nBut last month, the government in Baku ordered the closure of the local offices of the International Red Cross, the only international organisation with access to Armenian prisoners.\nThe European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the \"unlawful detention and sham trials of Armenian hostages\", calling for their immediate release.\nVardanyan returns to court on Tuesday, but supporters fear his case will be overshadowed by a historic peace deal taking shape between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\nThe details are yet to be made public but officials say the draft text does not include the issue of the prisoners on trial or the right of ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to return to their homes.\nThe failure to mention the prisoners has prompted criticism of Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's government at home and abroad.\nBut Arsen Torosyan, the MP from the Armenian governing party Civil Contract believes this issue needs to be solved separately.\n\"It is a peace treaty between the conflicting countries with a long history of hatred between each other. I personally think that only completing or signing of this peace treaty can make ground to solve the issue of political prisoners. I don't see any other way to do it.\"\nVardanyan has warned this is a mistake.\n\"This is not the trial of just me and 15 others \u2013 this is the trial of all Armenians,\" he said in a voice message to supporters. \n\"If you don't understand this \u2013 it is a big tragedy because this is not the end of the story, not the end of the conflict, it's only the next stage of the conflict, for all sides.\"",

Only authorised persons can go in close proximity to them to perform a specific task,\" Mr Sharma said.\nInitial reports in the media called the video \"heartwarming\" but many on social media raised concerns about the safety of people and animals in such situations. Others suggested a better option would be for the authorities to create ponds and water bodies in the park to ensure the cats did not have to go far for water in the hot summer.\nVillages on the park's border have been tense as cheetahs wander into their fields and kill their livestock. Last month, some villagers pelted the cats with stones to stop such attacks, The New Indian Express newspaper reported. Officials say they have been trying to raise awareness in the villages so that people adapt to living near the animals.\nTwenty cheetahs were relocated from South Africa and Namibia to the Kuno national park in the central state of Madhya Pradesh between 2022 and 2023 in what was the first such intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\nEight of them have since died due to various reasons, including kidney failure and mating injuries, sparking concerns about whether conditions at Kuno are suitable for them. \nIn 2023, South African and Namibian experts involved with the project wrote to India's Supreme Court, saying they believed that some of these deaths could have been prevented by \"better monitoring of animals and more appropriate and timely veterinary care\". \nExperts from the Namibia-based Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which has been involved with the project since its inception, had also raised concerns about inadequate record-keeping at Kuno. They told the BBC that the park management had \"little or no scientific training\" and the vets were \"too inexperienced to manage a project of this calibre\".\nPark authorities have rejected the allegations and say there are now a total of 26 cheetahs, including 17 in the wild and nine others that are kept in enclosures at the moment.\nThis year, India is expected to receive 20 more cheetahs from South Africa. Officials say the big cats have already been identified by a task force in collaboration with South African authorities.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

Trump later raised the tariff on China to 125%.\nStock markets have been falling sharply over the past few days in reaction to the escalating global trade war and fears of tariffs leading to higher prices, although US stocks soared when Trump announced the 90-day pause and a lowered 10% reciprocal tariff for other countries.\nHowever, the sale of bonds in the US poses a major problem for the world's biggest economy.\nThe interest rate - or yield - for US government borrowing over 10 years has spiked sharply in the past couple of days from 3.9% to 4.5%, the highest level since February.\nThe rise has spooked economists because US bonds are traditionally seen as a so-called safe haven for investors to put their money in times of financial turmoil.\n\"Rising bond yields mean higher costs for companies to borrow, and of course governments too,\" said Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell.\n\"Bonds should do well in times of turmoil as investors flee to safety, but Trump's trade war is now undermining the US debt market,\" he added.\nWhile interest rates on US government debt rose, the price of the bonds themselves fell as demand weakened due to investors offloading them.\nMohammed El Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz and former boss of the biggest bond manager Pimco, said one reason US borrowing costs had shot up was because there had been an \"erosion\" of bonds being seen as a safe haven.\nHe added concerns over the impact of tariffs on inflation and US government budgets were also reasons.\nSome analysts suggested that America's central bank - the US Federal Reserve -  might be forced to step in if turbulence continues, in a move reminiscent of the Bank of England's emergency action in 2022 following Liz Truss's mini-Budget. \n\"We see no other option for the Fed but to step in with emergency purchases of US Treasuries to stabilise the bond market,\" said George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank.\n\"We are entering uncharted territory,\" he said, adding that it was \"very hard\" to predict how markets would react in the coming days as the bond market suggested investors had \"lost faith in US assets\".\nMr El Erian told the BBC's World At One that the Fed would be \"torn\" over what action to take, given its main mandates are to manage inflation and maximise employment.\nEconomists have predicted US tariffs, which will be paid for by American companies importing goods from abroad, will raise consumer prices domestically.\nTrump's plan is aimed at protecting American businesses from foreign competition and also to boost domestic manufacturing.\nHowever, tumbling stock markets resulting from fears extra taxes will hit the profits of companies, could lead ultimately to firms cutting jobs and an economic downturn.\nJP Morgan, the investment banking giant, has raised the likelihood of a US recession from 40% to 60% and warned that American policy was \"tilting away from growth\".\nSimon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, told the BBC that the Fed could decide to cut interest rates in a bid to protect US jobs by making it easier for businesses to borrow cash as they face higher costs from tariffs.\nHe said it was a \"coin toss\" over whether the US would enter a recession.\nThis is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.\nMr El Erian said the UK was likely to be impacted by the US bonds sell-off.\n\"When US treasuries sneeze, UK government bonds catch a cold - we have seen a significant move up in UK bond yields which means more pressure on the Budget,\" he added.\nRising UK bond yields means \"higher borrowing costs for companies and households,\" he added.\nThe Bank of England warned on Wednesday that US tariffs \"contributed to a material increase in the risk to global growth\" and financial stability.\n\"Uncertainty has intensified,\" it said.\nInvestors are now betting on the Bank to cut interest rates by as many as four times, to bolster the economy against a potential economic downturn.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that Trump's goal was to bring \"jobs and manufacturing back to the United States, raising wages, increasing revenues and reviving the American Dream\".\nHe said the Trump administration was looking to \"right the wrongs of longstanding global trade imbalances\".\nQuestions remain over the scale and what type of investors are dumping US bonds.\nThere has been speculation some foreign countries, such as China which owns some $759bn of US bonds, might be selling them. \nMr Saravelos warned there could be \"no winner\" to this trade war. \"The loser will be the global economy,\" he added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.\nThe immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.\nBut sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.\nThe new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.\n\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"\nThe scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.\nExperts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.\nPassengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.\nThe digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.\nLying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.\nThis would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.\nAll died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.\n\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.\n\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"\nA new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.\nIt takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.\n\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.\nThe simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.\nTitanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded. \nBut the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.\n\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.\n\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"\nUnfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.\nThe human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.\nPersonal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.\nThe scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.\n\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.\n\"Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.\"",

        "article_text": "Residential damage in Augusta caused by Hurricane Helene has reached $282m (\u00a3220m)\nThe manicured grass around the entrance to Augusta National is pristine. It always is.\nIn the suburbs which circle the home of the Masters, though, it is a different picture.\nFractured trees sprawl across gardens. Rubbles of wood and brick stack high. Homes remain shattered. So do lives.\nWhen Rory McIlroy and the world's best golfers arrived in Augusta this week, along with an estimated 200,000 fans, the devastation caused by one of the United States' deadliest natural disasters was laid bare before them.\nIn September, Hurricane Helene hit the south-eastern States - leaving death and destruction in its wake.\nAugusta, nicknamed 'The Garden City' because of its natural greenery, felt its mighty force. The residents are still dealing with the effects.\n\"There were multiple hours of 80mph winds which laid all of the forest down,\" lifelong Augusta resident Tonya Bonitatibus told BBC Sport.\n\"A lot of trees fell on top of houses and crushed cars \u2013 I lost my truck. But I was a lucky one.\"\nWhen Helene reached the American coast, it brought extreme winds, numerous tornadoes and flooding across several states. \nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Helene is responsible for at least 249 fatalities in the United States, including at least 175 direct deaths.\nIt was the deadliest hurricane in the US since Katrina in 2005.\nFlorida, on the south-eastern frontier, bore the brunt of the force. But Helene quickly headed further north, engulfing South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia.\nAugusta, which is the third most populous city in Georgia, was attacked by gusts of wind which reached 100mph through the night of 26 September - with stark consequences.\n\"Helene's winds were responsible for killing 11 people - all from trees falling onto homes in the greater Augusta area,\" a spokesperson for the National Hurricane Center told BBC Sport.\n\"At least 362 homes and buildings were destroyed, while 3,000 others suffered major damage, and 3,500 others experienced minor to moderate damage.\"\nAugusta officials say almost 17,000 fallen trees have been removed from the city\nResidents living close to Augusta National had to leave their homes. Thousands were left without electricity and water.\nJoseph Crosby, his wife Kasey and their three children still cannot live in their storm damaged home, about five miles from the iconic course.\nHe recalls watching a mature Ash tree, which he estimates had grown over 60 feet tall, being \"blown around like a rag doll\".\n\"I think your brain compartmentalises what you're going through,\" Joseph recalls of the night itself.\n\"All you think of at that moment is just survival and keeping your kids safe. \n\"I just remember thinking if the tree came down on our house or something were to happen, would my kids be OK?\"\nThe Crosby family home is among 1,695 properties damaged in the city of Augusta. City officials estimate the cost of residential losses has reached $282m (\u00a3220m).\n\"Folks here are resilient but this won't soon be forgotten. It reminds one how frail and furious nature can be,\" local journalist Joe Kovac told BBC Sport.\n\nAugusta National Golf Club was not as badly affected as the suburbs nearby.\nBut it did not escape. \n\"After the storm when you rode around Augusta National, on Washington Road, the pile of trees was above your car for mile after mile,\" said Bonitatibus.\nTrees came down in their hundreds on the famed course, damaging one of golf's most famous greens on the par-three 16th.\nWalking the course now is a lighter, less claustrophobic experience.  \nYou can see through wooded areas that previously screened individual holes and made them their own isolated stations.\nThe separation of the ninth and first fairways is less cluttered. \nComing down the 11th hole it is possible to see into the neighbouring Augusta Country Club course.\nThe wooded area to the right of the newly-laid 16th green will have fewer shadows when the world's best golfers begin their challenge for the famous Green Jacket on Thursday.  \nSpeaking in January, Augusta National Golf Club chairman Fred Ridley said: \"As far as the golf course goes, it's in spectacular condition.\n\"We had minor damage to the course, the playing surfaces themselves, but we were able to get that back in shape.\n\"I don't think you're going to see any difference in the condition for the Masters this year.\"\nKovac, who recently wrote a vivid account of the city's recovery process,, external agreed.\n\"I was struck by how emerald-green it is, at least the periphery. It is as if the grass never flinched,\" said the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter.\n\"The kerbside lawn around the course perimeter looks manicured to the hilt. Only regular patrons will really notice trees are missing.\n\"But further into the miles of neighbourhoods ringing the National one cannot help but see the wreckage and its remains.\"\nDriving around Augusta, it does not take much to notice the roadsides still populated by fallen trees - oaks, ash and giant pines. \nLong established homes bear scars of severe roof damage, much of it protected only by the flimsy tarpaulins.\nLife has been dominated recently by the need to join lengthy queues for construction and repair workers. \n\"It's been a journey, just rebuilding. It's been really neat to see the community come together in a town like this,\" said Kasey Crosby.\n\"We've heard lots of stories of neighbours helping each other.\n\"Cutting neighbours out of their driveways so they can get their cars out and get to work, or to get to the grocery store. \n\"People are pulling together, helping one another with chainsaws and just showing up.\"\nAugusta is described by its government as a 'centre of medicine, manufacturing, and military'. \nHowever, its job market has long been unstable and the city is ranked among the neediest in the US.\nIn December 2023, local newspaper, the Augusta Chronicle, reported it was ranked the nation's fifth worst city for economic well-being.\nChild poverty, food insecurity and unemployment rates were highlighted as particular problems.\nBlue tarpaulin covering the roofs of Augusta houses is a common sight \nAugusta National, which stumped up $20m (\u00a315.8m) in Masters prize money last year, is well aware of its privilege.\nIn the aftermath of Helene, the club provided $5m of financial support to the relief fund.\nBonitatibus, a riverkeeper who looks after the Savannah waterway, says the aid had a \"huge\" impact and reinforced Augusta National's philanthropic role in the community.\nThe money helped provide food, water, laundry, showers and counselling services.\nBonitatibus estimates the city is about \"60%\" through its recovery, although fears the environmental impact will last for \"many, many years\".\n\"We have things we need to shift as a community so when the next storm comes we're more prepared,\" she said.\n\"In terms of planting trees again, that's a couple of generations. We lost a 100-year-old on our property.\"\nMasters week, which has been held in Augusta since 1934, has long been one of the biggest economic drivers in the city.\nLast year, Forbes reported it contributes an estimated $120m (\u00a394m) annually., external\nA hefty percentage of the 200,000 population rent out their homes - and land - for players, patrons and the media to lay their heads.\nGiven the devastation, this Masters week holds extra significance and will provide a much-needed financial injection for the thousands affected.\nMany have been hanging on, forlorn and frustrated, in the hope of a positive answer from insurance companies deluged by desperate claims.\n\"The Masters is definitely the time when we put our best foot forward \u2013 and we're doing that again,\" said Bonitatibus.\n\"We're happy it is here \u2013 thank goodness, we need the proper cash. This is a huge opportunity for us to get back right.\"",

If you can roll the tapes, we shook on it. She didn't agree when we went to sign the contract,\" Serrano said.\n\"If that's her choice then that's her choice, but I believe that women should get the recognition and the equality that the men get.\"\nThe pair have always insisted that while there is no friendship, they share a mutual respect.\nBut there was plenty of needle when a wide-eyed Serrano removed the headguard and stared into a smirking Taylor's eyes, before they both departed the stage without a handshake or even a nod of acknowledgement. \nSerrano and her team accused Taylor of headbutting her last time they fought, before Serrano retracted her statement later\nIt had up until that point been a respectful event in the theatre at Madison Square Garden, with both fighters talking about the magnitude of their rivalry and the legacy it would leave on female boxing.\nBut the usually reserved Taylor \u2013 who after her win last year suggested they should increase the length and number of the rounds - did not back down.\n\"I think as a matter of principle that the challenger shouldn't be dictating the terms of the fight,\" Taylor said.\n\"I am 2-0 here and I'm in the driver's seat here and that's only right.

How many knockouts did you get in your 12 three-minute rounds? Zero,\" Taylor said.\nThe conversation turned to the outcome of their second fight as Serrano repeated her belief that she should have been awarded the decision. \n\"If you look at those fights, you can clearly see that I won those two fights.

That is when there is expectation to win. That is when the fans are on you. There are 20 minutes to go, it's 0-0 or you are getting beaten. The pressure is heaped on you. Have you got it in you to stand up and be counted?\nThat is what makes or breaks a Rangers player. And, in this squad, there are not enough players with the mentality to get through those periods. That for me is where this squad is at - and that is the aspect that has let them down.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app\nThis video can not be played\nSaturday's loss to Hibernian set an unwanted Rangers record of five straight home defeats\nThat is separate to the technical attributes of these players, though. They are good footballers. They have shown that in European games. They have shown that against Celtic. \nIt was only last month they knocked Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce out of the Europa League and went to Celtic Park and won for the first time in years.\nBut those games bring a different pressure. They bring a different expectation. Going into big European games, especially in the knockout rounds, rarely is there expectancy on Rangers to win.\nMeanwhile, domestically, they simply need to win, win, win. Their tempo needs to be high. They need to commit more bodies forward. \nHow many times have you watched a Rangers game where their two centre-halves are in the attacking half against one striker? That is because, in basic terms, they have to commit more in an attacking sense.\nBut you are at risk if you lose the ball. Just look at Hibernian's second goal on Saturday. It comes from a point where Rangers' defensive-minded players are in Hibs' half.\nIn Europe, you will rarely see that situation with a Rangers team, because they have more focus on the defensive side of their game.\nThe easier thing to do in football is be a defensive team. That is what I think this Rangers team are more comfortable doing. They feel more at ease playing in a defensively organised team that can then counter-attack. \nWhy is it easier? Well, in those moments, you are not coaching a set pattern to break a team down. When that is your gameplan, inevitably when you get possession, the opposition are not set up to be broken down. \nThese Rangers players are intelligent footballers. They get the gameplan of stopping the opposition and being clinical on the counter. They have shown that under Barry Ferguson away to Fenerbahce and Celtic playing in a 3-4-3 set-up.\nIn those games, when Rangers have won the ball, they have been in positions to score goals because even when they are sitting deep in a defensive formation, they always have three attackers forward.\nDefensively, they have more players deeper in the pitch and enough bodies to defend. And, in the attacking sense, having one striker and two number 10s means it is not just Cyriel Dessers or Vaclav Cerny running forward themselves.\nRangers' average player positions in last month's 3-1 win at Fenerbahce (left) and Saturday's defeat at home to Hibs (right) show a stark contrast between where their defensive line typically sits in European and domestic games\nThat approach did not work so well in the home leg against Fenerbahce, or the first half of their league game at Dundee, when they were perhaps expected to take the game to the opposition.\nBut for Thursday's encounter with Athletic Bilbao, I feel the first leg being at home should suit Rangers.\nMost European games that are two-legged affairs, particular in the latter stages of competitions, the first leg is always more cagey. It will probably be accepted a bit more by the Ibrox crowd if Rangers are a bit more solid. \nRangers would bite your hand off to go into that second leg in Bilbao at 0-0. But, make no mistake about it, this will be their toughest European game to date this season. \nThey are going to face a seriously technical team who are fourth in Spain's top flight. They have a top, top coach like Ernesto Valverde - a two-time La Liga winner as Barcelona boss - and they play with good tempo in their approach. \nThat is their model and how they play, so expect their set-up behind the ball to be really good if counter-attack opportunities arise for Rangers.\nThere is no getting away from how big a task this is for Ferguson and his unpredictable players, but that is not to say they cannot hurt them - they can.\nFormer Rangers striker Steven Naismith was speaking to BBC Sport Scotland's Nick McPheat",

        "article_text": "'Red and green should never be seen', apparently - but Bernhard Langer was delighted to pair his red polo shirt with the iconic Green Jacket in 1985\nWhen Tiger Woods romped to his first Masters title in 1997, he did so wearing a red top that quickly became established as his iconic Sunday colour.\nBut the American, who would go on to win five times at Augusta National, was not the first to make the fashion faux pas of pairing a red polo shirt with the Green Jacket.\nForty years ago this weekend, Bernhard Langer set the tone as he marched to the first of his two Masters victories - he even wore red trousers, too.\n\"I always tease Tiger,\" said the 67-year-old, who was close to tears as he talked about playing in his 41st and final Masters this week.\n\"See, I was the one wearing a red shirt first; you came later.\" \nLanger has previously joked that he \"looked like a Christmas tree\" when he donned the famous Green Jacket for the first time in 1985.\n\nMasters - dates, tee times, favourites & how to follow on the BBC\n'McIlroy's Masters memories must be turned into a positive'\nCabrera wins on eve of Masters return after time in prison\nHis final Masters was supposed to be last year but a snapped Achilles tendon - an injury suffered while playing pickleball - meant the German couldn't play. So he delayed saying farewell to a place that means so much to him.\n\"They're the two most important wins in my career,\" he said of his 1985 and 1993 victories at Augusta, which are his sole major triumphs.\n\"It's emotional. You can tell already my voice is breaking a bit just realising it's going to be my last competitive Masters.\"\nLanger has conceded for many years that he no longer has the game to compete at Augusta; three missed cuts in his past three Masters are testament to that.\n\"The course is just getting too long and I'm getting shorter and shorter,\" he said. \n\"I'm hitting hybrids [into greens] where the other kids are hitting nine-irons, maybe even wedges. So I knew I wasn't going to be in contention anymore.\n\"A few years back I asked the chairman of the club, 'is there a time limit? Do we age out when we're 60?'. He said, 'no, you will know when it's time to quit, it's totally up to you'.\n\"It is time to quit.\"\nLyle, Langer, Woosnam, Olazabal, Ballesteros and Faldo were victorious at Augusta National in an extraordinary era of success for European golf\nLanger was runner-up at The Open twice and third on three occasions in a career that promised more major success.\nThat he was unable to add a major other than his two at Augusta only intensifies his link to this fabled corner of Georgia.\nIn 40 appearances, he has made the cut 27 times and finished inside the top 10 nine times.\n\"It's been an incredible journey, for a young man born in a village of 800 people [in Bavaria, southern Germany], where golf was nothing, to make it here,\" he said.\n\"To get an invitation to play the Masters when it was extremely difficult for European or international players to get one, and then to win the Masters on the third go was just a dream come true.\"\nHe was just the third non-American winner, following in the footsteps of South Africa's three-time champion Gary Player and Seve Ballesteros of Spain, who won twice. \nHis win cemented belief among Europeans that success could be achieved at Augusta.\nBallesteros paved the way with his victories in 1980 and 1983, before Langer won his first two years later. \nThen Scotland's Sandy Lyle, England's Nick Faldo (twice) Wales' Ian Woosnam, Langer again and Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal collected six of seven titles from 1988.\nLanger's debut was in 1982, two years after Ballesteros had broken the glass ceiling. \nThe German's initial experience was hardly noteworthy. He shot 77 and 78 to miss the halfway cut by one stroke after three-putting 11 times in 36 holes on unfamiliar greens that were too slick for a naive 24-year-old.\n\"Coming here the first time, driving down Magnolia Lane, seeing this place for the first time was an eye-opener,\" he said. \n\"I had never seen a golf course manicured like this or a tournament run as efficiently as this has been.\"\nBy the time Langer won his second title in 1993, he was married with three children\nHe vowed to come back better prepared and when he returned two years later he made it through to the weekend - the first of an incredible run of 19 successive Masters that Langer would play all four rounds.\nHis victory 12 months later was secured with a classic back-nine Augusta charge. He birdied four out of six holes from the 12th as he overturned a three-shot deficit to Curtis Strange, who dropped shots on three of his final five holes.\nLanger bogeyed the 18th but still beat Strange, Ray Floyd and his playing partner Ballesteros by two shots.\nHe made a solid defence of his title in 1986 and briefly shared the lead in the final round before Jack Nicklaus produced a back nine for the ages to clinch his record-extending sixth Green Jacket and 18th major title.\nThat week was also memorable for witnessing the first time a world ranking was published, and it was Langer who had the honour of topping the inaugural list.\nHe was becoming something of an Augusta specialist and the love affair strengthened with two more top 10s before he claimed his second victory in 1993.\nLanger was challenged by unheralded American Dan Forsman in the final round. \nForsman was one shot behind the German when he teed off on the notoriously tricky par-three 12th. He dumped two balls in the water, walked off with a quadruple-bogey seven and was barely heard of again.\nIn contrast, Langer's name continued to pepper the leaderboards at Augusta, with top 10s in 1997, 2001 and 2004. \nHe finished joint eighth at the age of 56 in 2014 and held the record for the oldest player to make the cut - at the age of 63 in 2020 - until Fred Couples eclipsed that in 2023.\nThis is Langer's final Masters but not the end of competitive golf for the former Ryder Cup captain, who looks as fit as he did in his pomp.\nHe shows no signs of slowing down on the PGA Tour Champions - the US-based seniors tour - and has racked up at least one victory a year since joining the circuit in 2007 when he turned 50. \nHe has won 12 majors among 47 senior victories - both of which are records.\nThis week he is back among the game's youthful elite though, and will seek to end his Masters career with the same controlled elegance with which he has played throughout his career.\nHe will not contend for the title. That is clear. Instead, the question is whether his Masters career ends after round two on Friday, or if he defies his own expectations and makes the cut.\n\"After four decades it's going to be bittersweet,\" he said.\n\"When I'm inside the ropes, my mind switches to being a competitor, play golf and take care of the task in front of me. \n\"But I might get a bit emotional looking around, seeing my family, my kids, my grandkids, my brother and other friends that are going to be supporting me this week.\n\"I love the Masters more than any tournament in the world.

        "article_text": "Take a four-hour slow train through the Eastern Ghats to discover how a remote hill station is changing the global coffee game.\nEven in December, early mornings are rarely pleasant on much of India's Andhra Pradesh coast. The air is already muggy by 06:30 as a crowd mills restlessly on platform five at Visakhapatnam (Vizag) railway station. However, these would-be passengers are no ordinary commuters, but travellers gathered for an experience. When the Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special rolls onto the platform, the crowd's relief is palpable; the two vistadome coaches at the back of the train that they've been anxiously waiting to board are air-conditioned.\u00a0\nIndians have only a nodding acquaintance with the concept of queues, so a mad scramble ensues as the train comes to a halt. Things settle down as it chugs out of the station and gradually picks up speed. The Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger Special also serves as a regular commuter service headed to the town of Kirandul in Chhattisgarh state, about 400km to the north-west, and takes about 14 hours to traverse the distance. But those in the vistadome coaches are interested only in the first leg, to Araku Valley. This serene hill station is about 120km away but takes four hours as the train winds its way through a whopping 58 tunnels cut through the Eastern Ghats. The two vistadome coaches \u2013 with their extra-large windows and rotatable seats \u2013 are designed to provide panoramic views of the area's mountain peaks and valleys and its gentle forested slopes that end in rushing rivers and streams, gorges and rocky promontories.\nAs the train whizzes past Vizag's neighbourhoods and suburbs, it provides snapshots of a city waking up: a vegetable vendor hauling their cart, a dog walker pulled by his dog, two bleary-eyed uniformed children clutching onto their father on a scooter to school. As the city segues into wide open fields and farmlands, the images change: smoke curls lazily into the sky from a lone thatched house in the middle of a farm, a diligent farmer urges on his oxen, a tractor hauls vegetables to the nearby market. The rhythmic clickety-clack of the train's wheels is familiar and soporific.\u00a0\u00a0\nLess than 30 minutes after leaving Vizag, the train slows considerably and begins ascending into the foothills of the Eastern Ghats. As if on cue, most seats in the coach swing to face the windows. The train climbs, plains fall away and even the sporadic habitations clinging to the peaks vanish. Hills and mountains in the distance appear blue-grey in the tender morning sun. But even before this panorama can register, complete darkness descends as the train enters the route's first tunnel. I'm startled by the sounds of adults and children screaming, in jest of course, for the few minutes it takes for us to come out the other side.\nWhen we emerge into daylight, the sight is jaw-dropping: a series of hillocks and gentle valleys, thickly forested, stretch out to the horizon where a haze-shrouded mountain range is just a hint of the soaring peaks to come. As I try to take in as much of the scene as possible, darkness descends again, and with it, more screaming.\nOn the other side is another surreal and dramatic sight: tracks bent around a hill, a green wall sloping straight up on one side, and a sheer drop on the other. The train slowly chugs forward, hugging the inner curve. The vistadomes' rear position means that the entire length of the train is visible, curling against the hill as if teetering on the edge. It then uncoils and wraps itself on the other side, trundling on a bridge built over a stream that gently flows several metres below. The bridge has no continuous guardrails, so, for a moment, it feels like the train is suspended in the air. But soon, the feeling is interrupted by darkness and more screaming, and another breathtaking view on the other side.\nTrain Journeys\nTrain Journeys is a BBC Travel series that celebrates the world's most interesting train rides and inspires readers to travel overland.\nThis sequence repeats over and over again and yet it never gets predictable or boring. Each of the route's 58 tunnels sets up anticipation for what might lay on the other side. Thick curtains of mist clinging to mountainsides or low-hanging clouds cloaking the peaks; rolling grasslands and forests spread out like someone had shaken out a giant green blanket and laid it down; deep valleys and gorges surrounded by undulating peaks; and fleeting glimpses of hamlets and habitations perched precariously on the hillsides.\u00a0\nWe stop every few minutes to drop and pick up commuters at musical-sounding stations that could be tongue-twisters to those unfamiliar: Pendurthi, Kottavalasa, Chimidipalli, Borraguhallu, Karakavalasa. At Shimiliguda, the station proudly wears its altitude on its sleeve: 996m above sea level. Throughout the journey, there is also a continuous parade of food vendors, delectable aromas wafting from their baskets as they sell idli-vada-chutney (a common breakfast of steamed rice cake with coconut chutney), samosa, savoury puffed rice and boiled peanuts.\nWhen the train finally rolls into Araku town, the station is crowded and noisy and the magic of the journey dissipates somewhat. But early next morning, Araku's appeal is on full display. A short walk leads to forests and coffee plantations speckled with tall silver oak trees, their trunks wrapped by pepper vines. Everything is covered in thick fog and the air is nippy, a far cry from Vizag's mugginess. The air is sappy and thick with terpenes. I catch faint whiffs of coffee and pepper.\nCoffee came to Araku with the British and was grown in scattered patches of plantations. Like other coffee-growing regions in India, Araku was an ideal location owing to its combination of soil, altitude and weather. After independence from British rule in 1947, the land passed into local government hands, but decades of underdevelopment and sporadic insurgency kept the region off most investment maps. That began to change in the early 2000s.\u00a0\n\"The local community wanted progress,\" says Manoj Kumar, CEO of the Naandi Foundation, a non-profit that works with farmers through community initiatives and sustainable models. \"So we looked around and thought since coffee was already growing in pockets, it could be expanded.\"\nWorking with local farmers, the organisation began establishing micro-plots of Arabica coffee using regenerative agriculture. What began at around 1,000 acres in 2002 currently stands at 100,000 acres farmed by more than 90,000 families, who each own about an acre on average. Besides coffee, farmers have been encouraged to multi-crop and now produce pepper, red kidney beans, ginger, turmeric, millets, rice, vegetables, fruits such as chikoo (sapodilla), mango, custard apple and avocado.\u00a0The result: a unique fair-trade coffee model known as Arakunomics, which won the Rockefeller Foundation's Food System Vision 2050 Prize in 2020.\nBut the foundation didn't stop there. In a first for Indian coffee, they \"terroir-mapped\" the beans \u2013 borrowing a concept from winemaking \u2013\u00a0and classified the end product into six distinct flavour profiles under the brand name ARAKU. Selective harvesting, sustainable practices and meticulous post-harvest processes have helped the beans consistently score 91/100 on specialty coffee rankings.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022 Malaysia's iconic 'Jungle Railway'\n\u2022 The Baltic Express: Central Europe's new hop-on hop-off train\n\"We grow about 2,000 metric tons of coffee, 98% of which is sourced by specialty coffee promoters across the world,\" Kumar says.\nTravellers can explore this story at various coffee holdings in the area, but Priya Rajagopal, a coffee enthusiast and former project manager in tech, recommends the Sunkarametta Coffee Plantation, about 13km south-east of Araku, where a wooden bridge runs for a few hundred metres through the plantation, suspended above the coffee plants and flanked by towering silver oaks. \"When I went, it was the flowering season (March to May) and the plants were full of white flowers, \" she says. \"The air is filled with a sweet, jasmine-like smell.\"\nA short distance away, the modest but informative Araku Coffee Museum offers a primer on the journey from seed to cup. The small adjacent caf\u00e9 serves a robust filter brew \u2013 earthy, rich and perfect for a chilly morning in the hills.\u00a0\nA few days after the train trip, back in Bengaluru, I head to the sole ARAKU cafe in India (most of their production is either exported, retailed in stores or available online), which is tucked away in the tree-lined avenues of the city's Indiranagar neighbourhood. I am torn between the various options but opt for their signature medium roast. It is beautifully rich red-brown and utterly mellow on the tongue. More importantly, a subtle peppery end note immediately transports me back to Araku\u2019s mist-covered winding lanes, the lush green forests and plantations \u2013 and the slow, soulful train ride that led me there.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

He made a comeback in 2005's Sin City, and was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for 2008's The Wrestler.\nSince becoming a child star on TV show Dance Moms in 2014, JoJo Siwa has forged a career as a multifaceted cultural force, releasing music, acting in Nickelodeon TV shows and films, and setting a trend for inescapable oversized hair bows. Delighting in her rainbow-coloured and sometimes provocative persona, she claimed last year to have invented \"gay pop\".\nTrisha Goddard became a household name thanks to her self-titled daytime talk show, which ran on ITV and Channel 5 between 1998 and 2010, before she took it to the US and then joined TalkTV. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, and revealed last year that it had returned and was now stage four.\nDaley Thompson is a legend of British athletics. He won Olympic golds in the decathlon in 1980 and 1984, and went undefeated in all competitions between 1979 and 1987.\nJack P Shepherd has been a fixture on Coronation Street for 25 years, playing Gail's son David Platt since he was 12. However, his contract ends this year and there are reports he could be leaving Weatherfield.\nPatsy Palmer has soap opera immortality as Bianca Jackson in EastEnders, a role she first played in 1993. She made her latest comeback in 2024, playing a key part in the 40th anniversary live episode this February.\nMichael Fabricant was a long-serving Conservative MP, sitting in the House of Commons between 1992 and 2024, when he lost his seat.

        "article_text": "Listen to James read this article\n\"The best salesman in history.\" This was what Donald Trump once called Volodymyr Zelensky because of the amount of aid the US has given Ukraine.\nWhether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.\nHis transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day. \nIn the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.\nBut with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.\nPolitically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests. \nBut is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?\nLater today the \"coalition of the willing\", a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine, will meet at Nato headquarters - notably without America. \nBefore Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.\nHis message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.\n\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nHis decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold. \n\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"\nLeshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"\nUkraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.\nLater in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.\n\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.\n\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"\nBut when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.\nAfter Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.\nMaria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.\n\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.\n\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"\nOn 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.\nOn that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.\nTensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".\nAfter the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.\nDespite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry. \nThe pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.\n\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.\nMr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".\n\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"\n\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Penta Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"\nThen there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".\nWhile Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.\n\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"\nWhen it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".\nHis defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.\nZelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.\nA mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv. \nThe US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.\nBut the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.\n\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"\nWhen the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.\n\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"\nWhatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.\nYet others argue more bend still is needed.\n\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.\n\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"\nMr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"\nAnd yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.\n\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.\nOrysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.\n\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".\nMr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".\nSome political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.\n\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"\nProf Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".\nStill, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.\nFor now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.\nAs for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?\n\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Vicky Riddell\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

You'd be forgiven for thinking we have been here before.\nBut, with another devastating innings in the Indian Premier League on Tuesday, Nicholas Pooran continued his remarkable run of form in the shortest format - a run that is threatening to rewrite the history books.\nSince the start of last year he has scored 738 more T20 runs than anyone else, is averaging 42.31, and is doing so while batting with a strike-rate of 162.49.\nBatters generally have a high strike-rate or average in T20s. Pooran is managing to achieve both.\nOnly Virat Kohli has scored more IPL runs than Nicholas Pooran since the start of the 2024 season but Pooran's strike-rate is 192.89 to Kohli's 152.61\nCondense the timeframe further and Pooran's statistics are even more remarkable. \nIn his last 10 innings he is averaging 57.7 while striking at 199, suggesting he has found the cheat code.\nHe has hit 211 sixes since the start of 2024. The next batter on the list is South African Heinrich Klaasen on 124.\nPooran, 29, broke former West Indies team-mate Chris Gayle's record for the most sixes in a calendar year last year - he hit 139 to Gayle's 135 in 2015 - and after scores of 70, 75, 44, 12 and 87 not out in this year's IPL is averaging 4.8 sixes per match this season.\nNo-one can better that in the IPL's history with Gayle's average of 3.9 per match during his peak years in 2012 the next best record.\n\"I don't plan to hit sixes,\" Pooran said earlier in the season.\n\"I just try my best to get in good positions and if it's there, just time the ball nicely.\"\nPunjab's Arya races to second century of 2025 IPL\nIPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takers\nPooran is regarded as one of the world's best hitters of spin. \nOver the past two IPL seasons, playing for Lucknow Super Giants, he has scored 448 runs at an average of 89.6 and strike-rate of 184.4 against slow bowlers - again suggesting he can bat with severe aggression while not getting out.\nHe stands with a classical-looking, slightly-open stance, taps the ground once as the spinner enters his delivery stride and then thrashes the ball with his fast hands.\n\"I've never worked on my bat speed, I'm just blessed with incredible talent,\" Pooran said.\nThe Trinidadian is not afraid to dispatch pace either. His strike-rate is 173.5 against left-arm quicks and 163.5 against right-armers.\nAccording to analysts CricViz, there is not one line of pace bowling Pooran does not strike at more than 200 against at the death. \nHe strikes at more than 200 against every length except for yorkers, against which he takes down bowlers at a still-remarkable 166.\n\"He is a hard worker. No one ever sees that,\" former England all-rounder Samit Patel, who has played with Pooran at Trinbago Knight Riders and MI Emirates, told the BBC.\n\"The amount of training he does to try and hit sixes is phenomenal.\n\"His mindset is absolutely second to none and he is fully committed. There are no half-hearted swings.\n\"Having seen him train, if the ball lands in a certain area, he has trained and trained so it is natural to him [to hit sixes].\"\nSince the start of 2023, Pooran strikes at 344.7 runs per hundred balls when playing the slog sweep, 266.7 when playing a hook shot and 234.7 on the pull.\nHaving previously batted in the middle order, Lucknow Super Giants and West Indies now use Pooran as a number three.\nThe result has been him succeeding in each phase of the game - the powerplay, middle overs and the death. \nAnalysts CricViz measure a batter's performance with their 'batting impact' model and Pooran is the only player the world to have an average impact above four in all three phases since 2023.\nThe only obvious chink in Pooran's armour is against left-arm wrist-spin, against which he averages 31.5 and strikes at 108.6.\nHe does have a weakness against bouncers, but only when they are bowled in the channel just outside off stump.\nStray too wide and he averages 55.5. Get too straight with a line above the stumps and that number jumps to 126.\n\"Because he hits 360 degrees he is very difficult to bowl at,\" Patel says.\n\"From a spinners point of view, we try and make him cut the ball. We try and make him hit behind the wicket. \n\"If he hits fours it's OK. When he hits sixes we know he is dangerous.\"",

        "article_text": "On 12 March, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was driving home with his young son in Maryland when he was stopped by agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nAgents took Mr Garcia into custody, then shuttled him to detention facilities in Louisiana and Texas. \nAccording to a federal judge, after three days, \"without any notice, legal process, or hearing\", Mr Garcia found himself back in his native El Salvador at an infamous prison known for housing gang members. \nThe government said he was deported due to an \"administrative error\".\nBut despite that, Mr Garcia remains incarcerated in El Salvador as lawyers debate the unusual intricacies of the case. \nA Maryland court ordered Mr Garcia be returned to the US,  but Trump officials argued that they cannot compel El Salvador to return Mr Garcia. The administration also argued that the judge ordering his return lacked the authority to do so.\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court put a temporary hold on lower court orders while they consider the matter.\nImmigration experts say that as US President Donald Trump takes a hardline approach on illegal immigration, this case has the potential to upend due process  for immigrants.\n\"If the US Supreme Court were to accept [the Trump administration's] position, it would completely eviscerate any rule of law in the immigration process,\" Maureen Sweeney, director of the University of Maryland's Chac\u00f3n Center for Immigrant Justice, told the BBC.  \n\"Because they could pick up anybody, at any time, and send them anywhere with no repercussions whatsoever.\"\nUS District Judge Paula Xinis wrote in a filing Sunday that ICE officials did not follow procedures in the Immigration and Nationality Act when they deported Mr Garcia to El Salvador.\nShe ruled the US must bring him back before midnight on Monday. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, writing that the US \"has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street\".\nYet the Trump administration has argued that it cannot comply, saying Judge Xinis' filing is outside her jurisdiction.\n\"Neither a federal district court nor the United States has authority to tell the Government of El Salvador what to do,\" US Solicitor General D John Sauer wrote in an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nNicole Hallett, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School said that while it is true - US district judges cannot order El Salvador to take action -  they can order the US government to have Mr Garcia returned.\nShe also said the US has previously facilitated the return of mistakenly deported individuals.\nProf Hallett also questioned the government's claim that the US is powerless to compel El Salvador to release Mr Garcia, citing an agreement between the two countries.\nThe US, under the Trump administration, paid El Salvador's government $6m to house prisoners it sends, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Top officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump himself have publicly touted the arrangement.\n\"It's almost as if the Salvadoran government is acting as an agent of the US government,\" Ms Hallett said, arguing that this makes the release more plausible.\nMr Garcia's lawyers argued that because El Salvador was detaining Mr Garcia \"at the direct request and pursuant to financial compensation\" from the US, the court could order the US government to request his return.\nMr Garcia is among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans deported under the Trump administration to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison. Officials allege they are gang members and therefore are subject to deportation.\nMr Garcia, who is married to a US citizen, does not have any gang ties and has never been charged with a crime, his lawyer says.\nHe was also protected by a \"withholding of removal\" order, which means the US government cannot send him back to El Salvador because he could face harm.

        "article_text": "President Trump has been justifying his sweeping tariffs with a series of claims about how the US is the victim of \"unfair trade\".\nHe has imposed tariffs - or import taxes - on countries around the world, including a 125% rate on goods imported from China. In response, China is hiking its tariffs on American imports. \nSome of Trump's claims on trade are unsubstantiated or even false. BBC Verify has been taking a closer look.\n\"We're making a fortune with tariffs - $2bn a day\", Trump has said about his new tariff regime on Tuesday. \nBBC Verify cannot find any published figures which show this.\nThe US Treasury Department publishes a daily statement on how much money from customs duties goes to the federal government.\nData from 7 April - which includes the impact of some of Trump's earlier tariffs - amounted to $215m (\u00a3168m).\nThat figure is well short of Trump's claim.\nIt is possible that he has based it on forecasts for the year ahead.\nThe US imported $9bn (\u00a37bn) worth of goods per day last year.\nSome analysts have calculated that the average rate of Trump's tariffs (as of 2 April) is 22%. \nApplying this to these import figures would get you to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) a day.\nBut this calculation assumes that the volume of US imports would stay at this level. \nAnother way Trump could have reached his figure is by basing it on what his trade advisor said on 6 April. \nPeter Navarro claimed the tariffs would raise $700bn (\u00a3546bn) a year and - from this - you can get to around $2bn a day. \nIt is not clear how Navarro came up with his figure and analysts have since argued that it could be much lower.\nBBC Verify has asked the White House for Trump's evidence.\nA trade deficit happens when a country buys more from another country than it sells to it and Trump claims the US has a huge one with China.\n\"We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China\", Trump told reporters on 7 April. \nThe US does have a large trade deficit in goods with China.\nOfficial figures show it was just over $295bn (\u00a3230bn) in 2024 - which is far less than the $1tn (\u00a3780bn) claimed by Trump.\nGlobally, in 2024, China exported nearly $1tn (\u00a3780bn) more goods than it imported. \nBut, contrary to what Trump said, that figure applies to all countries, not just the US.\nTrump has claimed that Canada charges US farmers a 270% tariff on their dairy products.\n\"Canada charges for our dairy products 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to 270,\" Trump said. \nIt is correct that Canada does impose high tariffs on US dairy products - including 241% for milk, 270% for dairy powder and 298% for butter - but they only apply under specific conditions.\nUnder the Canadian system, US dairy goods can enter the country duty-free or with very low tariffs - until certain quotas are exceeded. Once this happens, higher tariffs are applied.\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US exported $1.14bn (\u00a3892m) worth of dairy products to Canada in 2024.\nDespite the volume of trade between the two countries, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) - which represents America's dairy industry - said \"the US has never gotten close\" to exceeding the quotas.\nThe IDFA has, however, supported Trump challenging Canada's approach, saying that tariff quotas as well as Canada's milk pricing policy was distorting trade. But it also said a tariff war would \"create uncertainly and additional costs for American dairy farmers\".\nTrade expert David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told BBC Verify that Canada is highly protective of its dairy market, but pointed out that \"President Trump actually negotiated the most recent trade deal between Canada and the US\".\nAs well as China, Trump singled out the European Union (EU) which he said had been formed \"to screw the United States\". \n\"You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm products. They don't take anything\", he said. \nWhile the US imports more cars from the EU than it exports to it, Trump's claim that they take no cars is false. \nIn 2024, the EU imported 164,857 US-made cars valued at \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.6bn), according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).\nMany more did go the other way - 749,170 EU-made cars were exported to the US last year valued at \u20ac38.5bn (\u00a333.3bn).\nTrump's claim about farm products is also false. \nThe EU bought $12.8bn (\u00a310bn) of US agricultural exports in 2024, making the EU America's fourth largest export market - according to the USDA.  \nBBC Verify will be looking at more trade claims. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "Maitland-Niles has become one of the leaders at Lyon but Cherki (left) is the young spark in the attack under manager Paulo Fonseca\nAinsley Maitland-Niles can count stars such as Bukayo Saka, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Phil Foden among his former team-mates but it is young Lyon sensation Rayan Cherki the ex-Arsenal man describes as the \"best natural talent\"  he has ever seen.\nMaitland-Niles and Cherki are part of a resurgent Lyon outfit who face Manchester United in the quarter-final of the Europa League at the Groupama Stadium on Thursday (20:00 BST).\nAs well as Maitland-Niles, Lyon have ex-Premier League players in former Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette and ex-United midfielder Nemanja Matic, plus World Cup winners in France international Corentin Tolisso and Argentina defender Nicolas Tagliafico. \nBut Cherki, 21, is the player that catches the eye and, according to Maitland-Niles, will be a major threat on Thursday night.\n\"He is the best natural talent I've ever seen,\" he tells BBC Sport. \"An absolute master, a wizard with the ball.\"\nCherki has nine goals and 18 assists in 36 games this season across all competitions but individual moments, like his two mazy dribbles to set up Malick Fofana goals against Rangers or his wonderful vision to pick out striker Georges Mikautadze against PSG have made the headlines. \n\"He is taking chances, assists and dragging us up the pitch by taking people on and nutmegging them - he is a genius,\" adds Maitland-Niles.\nOnly three players from Europe's top five leagues - Bruno Fernandes (129), Raphinha (122) and Joshua Kimmich (113) - have created more than Cherki's 103 chances in all competitions this season. And he ranks second in Ligue 1 for completed dribbles with 74, behind Paris St-Germain's Desire Doue with 79.\nThere are also training videos of Cherki with France Under-21s, where he displays equal ability to control and volley a ball with both feet. \n\"He is two-footed, has no fear, keeps going and going, can get past people with such ease, such finesse,\" says Maitland-Niles.\n\"He is now working for the team off the ball and has gone to another level this season.\"\nIn an in-depth interview with BBC Sport, Maitland-Niles also talks about why Arsenal are too reliant on Saka, success under Jose Mourinho at Roma, moving to France and why Lyon will show Manchester United \"respect\". \nMaitland-Niles has been a near ever-present for Lyon and played 34 matches in all competitions this season\nAfter becoming the second youngest Arsenal player to appear in the Champions League, Maitland-Niles thought he would be at his boyhood club his entire life. \nThe defender had been in the Arsenal academy since the age of six and grew up supporting the club but opted to leave on a free transfer to Lyon in 2023. \n\"Life has obviously taken a different turn,\" he says. \"I thought I'd have been in the Premier League my whole career and things obviously didn't go to plan with Arsenal.\n\"But I'm thankful to the club and they didn't put any blockages when it came to leaving. I left as, like most footballers, I wanted to play.\"\nBut why not join another Premier League club? \nHe says: \"I told my agent not to tell me which clubs were interested but just the ones with firm offers. \n\"Lyon were the first to come in and it was such a big club showing their trust and belief in me. It was hard to turn down and it was a good time to try something different. I was at a point where I needed to be shown a lot of love and thought it was a good fit for me. \n\"Of course, I am happy with where I am at this point in time. But who is to say what might come up? In the meantime, I am very happy here and enjoying every moment.\n\"I am still that same player as I was at Arsenal but now with a stronger mindset and more consistency and I know what it takes to succeed.\"\nMaitland-Niles won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2020\nA debut under legendary manager Arsene Wenger, a Europa League final start under Unai Emery in 2019, winning the FA Cup with Mikel Arteta in 2020 and winning five England caps all rank among the major landmarks in Maitland-Niles' journey.\n\"I'm still an Arsenal fan, I watch most of our games and I lived a boyhood dream by winning an FA Cup final at Wembley for the club. [That] was the pinnacle. I supported Arsenal since I was six. I wish them well,\" he adds. \nBut the FA Cup under Arteta, who he regards as a \"tactical genius in Pep Guardiola's mould\", is the last trophy Arsenal have won. \n\"[Arteta] really studied how Pep took football to new heights as one of the best managers in the world,\" he says. \"He really studied how to break down teams and be most effective in games.\n\"Arsenal are showing that at this point, not coming close enough to win the league but you can see they are making big improvements by going close two years in a row.\"\nOn his relationship with Arteta, the defender adds: \"I wouldn't say there was anything special there. I had respect for him as a manager, I thought he was a tactical genius but it was an average player-manager relationship, not especially close.\"\nMaitland-Niles also admits it is \"frustrating\" the club has not followed up that FA Cup success but gives his backing to Arteta, while adding star attacker Saka needs support.\n\"I think they now rely on him a bit too much and you can't expect so much from such a young player,\" he says.\n\"He hasn't even hit his prime yet. But I think he is the driving force of the team and they miss a bit of attacking threat when he is not playing.\n\"Bukayo has become one of the world's best wingers, very consistent, knows how to kill off a game and he can pick his moment in a genius way.\"\nAttacker Ethan Nwaneri, 18, is having his breakthrough this season and could be one option to help Saka.\n\"Physically, he is absolutely incredible and there is no fear in the kid,\" continues Maitland-Niles.  \n\"He is just going at people and trying to make things happen. You can see he is trying to become a leader very early in that team. He is trying to cement his place which is difficult as he plays in the same positions as [Martin] Odegaard and Saka. \n\"But he has got the ability to do so as well. He has the world at his feet and he just needs to take his chance.\"\nAnother landmark for Maitland-Niles was winning the Conference League under Mourinho during a successful six-month loan stint at Roma.\n\"He is a really funny guy,\" says Maitland-Niles. \"The stories Jose gave us about his previous dressing rooms and how he has won cup finals and loads of different leagues - that is an experience you can take something from.\n\"There are a lot of players that would say they love him or hate him. But he is a great guy and what you see is what you get.\"\nMaitland-Niles achieved European success in the Conference League for Jose Mourinho's Roma in 2022\nMaitland-Niles, who is becoming one of the leaders at Lyon, has warned Thursday's Europa League opponents Manchester United that \"people don't realise how big Lyon are\".\n\"We are a historically big club,\" he adds. \"Considering where we were last season, it has been a great year but we need to be addicted to winning, push for more and aim for the Champions League.\"\nMaitland-Niles also says Lyon will try to show Ruben Amorim's United side \"respect but just not too much respect\".\nHe adds: \"They are not having the greatest season but have players like Bruno (Fernandes) and (Christian) Eriksen can run over you if you show too much respect. \n\"We have a great team, great manager and team spirit. We will not be scared, we'll give it our all and believe we can win.\"\nOf course, returning to England for the second leg will also prove exciting.\nHe says: \"As an Englishman, it will be nice to go home. Old Trafford is nothing short of what they call it, the Theatre of Dreams - it can be a dream for you but it can crush your dreams, too.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "A day before Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs are scheduled to kick in, the US president appears locked in a high-stakes game of chicken, with the world's economy hanging in the balance.\nSome nations labelled \"worst offenders\" are scrambling to make nice with the White House to end this game before it reaches a potentially devastating climax.\nChina, in contrast, is playing a different game, one of retaliation and resistance.\nMeanwhile, Trump has pressed ahead, even as some allies \u2013 in Congress and on Wall Street \u2013 wonder if he's going too far. On Sunday, when asked what level of market fall he would tolerate before changing course, he snapped that it was a \"stupid question\".\nSo is it all a negotiating tactic as many investors and politicians hope \u2013 or is he playing a longer game aimed at permanently restructuring the global economy and America's place in it? In this new world, whether a country is an ally or an adversary depends on whether that nation is giving the US a good deal.\nOn Monday afternoon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first world leader to visit the president since his trade announcement, tried his hand at playing Trump's new game. He pledged that his nation \u2013 which has been slotted for tariffs of 17% \u2013 would drop its trade barriers and move to eliminate its trade surplus with the US.\n\"We think it is the right thing to do,\" he said. \"I think Israel can serve as a model to many countries that ought to do the same.\"\nOther nations appear to be pursuing a similar strategy in the hopes of a positive result.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called Trump on Monday morning, prompting Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to state that the US was beginning negotiations with the nation to \"implement the president's vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade\".\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Europe was \"ready to negotiate\" with the US, offering a mutual reduction of tariffs on industrial goods to zero \u2013 a proposal that Trump praised during remarks at the Oval Office, while saying it was still \"not enough\".\nThere were no such gestures from China. On Monday morning, America's top economic competitor announced that it was responding to Trump's 34% tariff increase with an additional 34% of its own.\nThat prompted Trump to threaten another 50% to US tariffs on China if it does not back down by Tuesday.\n\"China has chosen to isolate itself by retaliating and doubling down on previous negative behaviour,\" Bessent posted on X. \"Over 50 countries have responded both openly and positively to Donald Trump's historic action to create a fairer, more prosperous system of global trade.\"\nChina's reaction to Trump's latest move was equally blunt.\n\"We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us,\" Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told BBC partner CBS News. \"China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\"\nSuch a series of reactions and reprisals from China and the US appeared to be exactly what investors feared last week, as American stock indexes dropped by double-digit percentages.\nBy Monday a growing chorus of business leaders were speaking out against Trump's tariff plan, including Wall Street financiers who had been strong public supporters of his administration \u2013 trying, it appeared, to get the president to back down by force of will alone.\nMeanwhile, US markets were poised to jump at any reason for hope. When a social media post on Monday morning indicated that the president was contemplating a 90-day delay on new tariffs \u2013 perhaps drawn from a misinterpretation of comments made by Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett on Fox News - US stock indexes soared. The S&P 500 index added $2.4tn in market value for about 10 minutes, only for it to all vanish once the White House quickly denied the president was contemplating such a move.\nTrump further closed the door on Monday afternoon, saying he was not \"looking at\" any kind of delay. It was still full speed ahead on tariffs.\n\"We're going to have one shot at this,\" he said.\nPerhaps the most concerning message for investors and foreign leaders hoping for a last-minute reprieve \u2013 and an exit ramp to stability - came from one of Trump's top trade advisers, Peter Navarro.\n\"This is not a negotiation,\" he wrote in a Financial Times opinion piece published on Monday afternoon. \"President Trump is always willing to listen. But to those world leaders who, after decades of cheating, are suddenly offering to lower tariffs - know this: that's just the beginning.\"\nSo if this is about the start of broader systemic change \u2013 what is the desired end goal worth potentially tanking the global economy?\nOne theory is that Trump has a plan with several of his top advisers \u2013 the \"Mar-a-Lago accord\", it is called \u2013 with the ultimate goal of compelling America's trading partners to weaken the US dollar on the international currency exchange. Such a move would make American exports more affordable to foreign markets and diminish the value of China's large reserves of US currency.\nIt's a plan pushed by Trump economic adviser Stephen Miran, although he has denied that it is current administration policy.\nThat's just one of the possible explanations for the current stock market mayhem that Trump has purposefully instigated \u2013 one that many other prominent economists warn is risky. It is far from the only one.\nEver since Trump shocked the world with his sweeping tariff plan, White House officials have fanned out across media to preach patience and offer a selection of sometimes contradictory explanations as to the strategy behind Trump's global trade war. He is doing it to raise revenue and protect American industry - or as a negotiating tool. The tariffs are permanent \u2013 or they are temporary. They will prompt individual deals with other nations - or compel some grand multilateral agreement.\nAs Trump presses on to Wednesday's tariff cliff with no signs of backing away, he seems willing to keep the world guessing.",

On Monday morning, America's top economic competitor announced that it was responding to Trump's 34% tariff increase with an additional 34% of its own.That prompted Trump to threaten another 50% to US tariffs on China if it does not back down by Tuesday. Three warning signs to watchA day before Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs are scheduled to kick in, the US president appears locked in a high-stakes game of chicken, with the world's economy hanging in the balance.Some nations labelled \"worst offenders\" are scrambling to make nice with the White House to end this game before it reaches a potentially devastating climax.China, in contrast, is playing a different game, one of retaliation and resistance.Meanwhile, Trump has pressed ahead, even as some allies \u2013 in Congress and on Wall Street \u2013 wonder if he's going too far. Such a move would make American exports more affordable to foreign markets and diminish the value of China's large reserves of US currency.It's a plan pushed by Trump economic adviser Stephen Miran, although he has denied that it is current administration policy.That's just one of the possible explanations for the current stock market mayhem that Trump has purposefully instigated \u2013 one that many other prominent economists warn is risky. \"Watch: Iran, tariffs and hostages - key moments in Trump meeting with NetanyahuSuch a series of reactions and reprisals from China and the US appeared to be exactly what investors feared last week, as American stock indexes dropped by double-digit percentages.By Monday a growing chorus of business leaders were speaking out against Trump's tariff plan, including Wall Street financiers who had been strong public supporters of his administration \u2013 trying, it appeared, to get the president to back down by force of will alone.Meanwhile, US markets were poised to jump at any reason for hope.",

        "article_text": "Chef Ruben Bond\u00ec knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.\nIn 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church, in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving \u2013 and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.\nFor Ruben Bond\u00ec, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, the tradizione giudaico-romanesca (Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset of Roman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.\n\"Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,\" says Bond\u00ec, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. \"Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.\"\nThe SpeciaList\n(Credit: Maurizio Fiorino)\nRuben Bond\u00ec is a Roman chef and food influencer whose cooking videos have earned him more than four million followers on social media. In 2023, he published a cookbook on Jewish Roman cuisine, Cucina con Ruben.\nDeveloped over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes \u2013 expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy \u2013 from carciofi alla giudia (fried artichokes) to stracotto (braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.\n\"Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing \u2013 typical [Jewish] dishes like concia di zucchine [marinated fried courgettes] and abbacchio [roasted lamb] with potatoes.\"\nBut behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history \u2013 from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 \u2013 Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.\n\"In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so] the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.\"\nToday, Rome's former ghetto \u2013 sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace \u2013 is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.\nHere are Bond\u00ec's top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.\nLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near the Tempio Maggiore synagogue and Porticus Octaviae \u2013 the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol \u2013 Ba'Ghetto is just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.\nDon't get your artichokes off-season\nWhile artichokes may be the undeniable star of the Roman Jewish kitchen, Bond\u00ec recommends visitors only consume the vegetable when it's in harvest. \"Avoid getting artichokes when they're off-season,\" he advises. \"You won't be served Italian artichokes, and they won't be as fresh. You should only get them when it's artichoke season, so from November-December to May.\"\n\"They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.\"\nAmong its Roman Jewish staples is carciofi alla giudia \u2013 a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.\nThe restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes like spaghetti alla carbonara and bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.\n\"Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nBa'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches in Venice, Florence and Milan. Its main restaurant \u2013 a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures \u2013 does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearby Ba'Ghetto Milky.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://www.baghetto.com\nAddress: Via del Portico D'Ottavia, 57, 00186 / Via del Portico D'Ottavia 2/A (Ba'Ghetto Milky)Phone:  +39 06 9674 0389 / 06 6830 0077 (Ba'Ghetto Milky)\nInstagram: @baghettorestaurants/\nRoman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.\nSo when local institution Renato al Ghetto \u2013 where Bond\u00ec worked as a waiter in his younger days \u2013 realised it could replicate its success with street food, its\u00a0hole-in-the-wall \"Rosetteria\" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.\n\"Rosette are a type of Roman bap,\" Bond\u00ec says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. \"I'd recommend beef stracotto or Roman artichokes.\"\nAmong the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chicken alla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under \u20ac12 (\u00a310).\n\"It's very good,\" Bond\u00ec says. \"I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.\"\nAddress: Via di S. Maria del Pianto, 63, 00186\nPhone: +39 338 859 3395\nInstagram: @rosetteria_renato_al_ghetto\n\"Meat is a strong part of our culinary tradition,\" Ruben says. \"And for meat lovers, I recommend BellaCarne.\"\nLocated a mere block from the ruins of the Porticus Octaviae, the restaurant's name itself is particularly promising \u2013 translating literally to \"Beautiful Meat\" \u2013 and its dishes definitely live up to expectations.\n\"I can especially vouch for their grilled meats,\" Bond\u00ec says, which include scottadito lamb and veal chops.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut while meat in all its forms \u2013 roast, fried, stewed and braised \u2013 is the undeniable star, it isn't the only thing worth ordering.\n\"They have an excellent vegan crostata [tart] for dessert,\" Bond\u00ec says, made with almond paste and sour cherries.\nRoman Jewish food may be humble by nature, but BellaCarne offers a decidedly refined dining experience, set in a chic, wood-panelled interior. As with other restaurants in the area, BellaCarne has also dedicated itself to street food, and you can find take-out options and lunchboxes at their grab-and-go spot, BellaCarne Street Food.\nWebsite: \nhttps://www.bellacarne.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 51, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 683 3104\nInstagram: \n@bellacarne/\nThe dishes of Roman cuisine are famous throughout Italy for being hearty and expressly casereccio \u2013 homestyle, homemade.\nCasalino, whose name evokes the warmth of the Italian lunch table, promises a cosy dining experience, and its oak floorings and earthy colours create an inviting ambiance.\n\"It's hearty, homey Jewish Roman food,\" Bond\u00ec says.\nThe restaurant was opened by the Zarfati family in 2021, after the opening of their successful Dolce Kosher bakery, and follows the recipes of the household matriarch, nonna Letizia.\nAmong its dishes are distinctive spins on local classics, such as salt-cured cod with tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins; butter and truffle tonnarelli pasta; and the must-have carciofi alla giudia.

        "article_text": "Stress, sugary drinks and lack of education have all been cited as factors in poor dental hygiene among young footballers\nSome academy footballers in England have been left unable to train because of dental problems, according to a new study which found three-quarters of participants are suffering with gum disease.\nThe study from researchers at University College London (UCL) asked 160 academy players representing 10 English football clubs from the Premier League, Championship and Women's Super League to answer a questionnaire about their oral health and its impact on sporting performance, alongside a clinical assessment by a dentist.\nIt found young male and female players are more likely to have major problems with tooth decay and poor oral hygiene than non-footballers of a similar age.\nDr Saul Konviser, one of the authors of the study published in the British Medical Journal, told the BBC there now needs to be a \"multi-factor\" approach in order to deal with the issue, including greater education on the cardiovascular issues linked with oral diseases and more routine dental care for players.\n\"We feel this is a great opportunity to take this evidence so we can advise and support medical teams at clubs,\" he said.\n\"I think it is an opportunity for sporting bodies to take action - we don't want negative dental health to impact sporting performance. There needs to be greater understanding that mouth is part of the body.\n\"We had players at screenings complaining of dental pain, bleeding gums, saying they were unable to train at some points because of dental infections.

        "article_text": "A photographer's iconic shot of polar bears in abandoned buildings on a Russian island shines a spotlight on wider changes in their behaviour.\nIn September 2021, Russian wildlife photographer Dmitry Kokh and his team were sailing around the wild and remote Chukotka Peninsula in Russia's extreme northeast. They were hoping to visit Wrangel Island, a well-known gathering place for polar bears, when the weather turned.\n\"We faced a heavy storm, with super-strong wind and waves, and we tried to find a place to shelter from the storm because the boat was small,\" Kokh recalls. They sheltered near the rocky shore of a small, uninhabited island called Kolyuchin, home to an abandoned Soviet-era weather station \u2013 and made an unexpected discovery.\n\"We saw some movement on the island, took out our binoculars, and saw polar bears roaming around there, many of them, maybe 15 or 20,\" Kokh says. \"We were super surprised because we never expected to meet polar bears so far to the south. At this time of the year, they should be on the sea ice already, and on Wrangel Island, normally.\"\u00a0\nThe weather station on Kolyuchin had been abandoned in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Stepping on the island to take pictures of the bears was too dangerous. Instead, Kokh used a drone, taking his time to get the bears used to it, then slowly flying it closer. As he was watching them, he noticed something else: there were bears inside some of the houses.\n\"I realised that it was a perfect setting for photography, because these houses are super photogenic, they are old and ruined, and animals looking out of these houses, is a perfect picture,\" he says. \"And the weather was terrible, [there was] wind and rain and fog, which is also very good for photography! So everything came together.\"\u00a0\nOne of the photos captures a bear in the entrance to the weather station, and another one looking out of the window. Titled\u00a0\"House of Bears\", it won Kokh the prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year award, given out annually by the Natural History Museum in London. \"It's the best picture I've ever taken, and I think I won't be able to repeat it, ever,\" he says.\nTom Smith, a\u00a0professor\u00a0of wildlife sciences at Brigham Young University in Utah, has spent decades conducting field work among bears, including polar bears, and says it's not unusual to see polar bears in abandoned buildings. \"They're curious animals so we see them in structures often, or they will be climbing on top of cars or pipelines,\" he explains. There has, however, been a more worrying trend across the Arctic, he says: as the sea ice melts, polar bears are increasingly approaching or wandering into inhabited towns or villages, to feed on open rubbish dumps. \"They are fatefully drawn towards human settlements,\" says Smith, and this can result in conflict with humans.\nThe problem is two-fold, according to Smith. One is that isolated, northern communities often use open rubbish pits near the village. Securing garbage so it can't be accessed, for example in bear-proof bins and enclosed landfills, is expensive, he points out \u2013 and in the past, was not necessary. \"The overwhelming Western influence in the north has resulted in [throwaway] economies that never existed there,\" he says. \"Those cultures never had a throwaway society, so the notion of having to secure garbage \u2013 that's a new thing.\"\nSecondly, Smith notes that polar bears are spending more time on land due to the climate-change-driven loss of sea ice. They are also shifting their dens from the ice onto the land, to avoid the risk of denning on the increasingly unstable sea ice, research in northern Alaska shows. Without the sea ice, the bears can't hunt for their preferred, ideal diet of blubber-rich seals, and may resort to land-based food, be it prey or rubbish.\n\"So we have a prediction that more and more bears are coming onto the land, they are increasingly hungry and drawn to these pits,\" Smith says. The rubbish pits tend to be close to the villages. \"Because of that, we can expect more and more conflict with bears,\" he warns.\nHe emphasises that polar bear attacks on humans are very rare. According to one study, across more than a century, from 1870 to 2014, there were only 73 attacks by wild polar bears on humans, distributed among the five countries with polar bears: Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and the United States. Twenty of the attacks were deadly, and 63 caused injuries. (Because the attacks often involved more than one person, the total number of deaths and injuries is higher than the number of attacks.) Smith says that humans are not part of bears' natural diet \u2013 in contrast to big cats such as tigers and lions, who do see humans as potential food. \"That is a global myth, that [polar bears] are the only bear that stalks and kills humans,\" he says.\nNevertheless, there have been cases where polar bears have attacked people, with malnourished male bears most likely to pose a threat to humans. In some cases, starving polar bears who have become used to human-provided food\u00a0may then see humans as prey, research suggests. Smith says it's the increasing proximity to humans that's the problem, rather than the bears hunting humans as such: \"The [bears] are there for the garbage, and then they will spin off into the village and of course they're quite capable of ripping doors and windows off. So we've seen an uptick in these confrontations,\" he says.\u00a0\nA 2022 research paper warns that food from human sources \u2013 especially waste \u2013 is an emerging threat to polar bears. The supply of such human-provided food including from dumps is growing, according to the paper. As a consequence, some communities in the Arctic have seen startling incursions of dozens of polar bears. The study notes that when given the choice between sea ice, and rubbish dumps on land, polar bears still prefer the sea ice \u2013 suggesting that they are resorting to the dumps out of necessity.\u00a0\nFor example, in 2019, 60 polar bears gathered at a dump near the village of Ryrkaypiy in the Chukotka region of Russia, a few 100 metres from the village, according to the study. The bears also entered the village, causing alarm, and forcing the villagers to cancel public events and keep their children at home. However, once the sea ice formed and thickened, the polar bears left the land and returned to the sea.\u00a0\nIn Novaya Zemlya, a remote Russian archipelago, a similar invasion of 52 polar bears happened in 2019, according to the study. \"Although polar bears had visited the dump in previous years, this event was unprecedented,\" the researchers note, and was likely due to the loss of sea ice. In Arviat, an Inuit community in Nunavut, Canada, the number of polar bears using the local open dump has grown each year since record keeping began in the 1960s.\u00a0\nSpending more time on land could threaten the bears' long-term survival, Smith says, as the marine diet is more suited to them. In particular, the high fat content of their preferred prey, seals, is crucial for their health. Fat, in the form of seal blubber, makes up around 70% of polar bears' natural diet on the sea ice. It contains twice the energy per gramme as muscle. In fact, when catching a seal, the bears mostly eat the blubber and leave the meat behind. To capture seals, the bears need sea ice \u2013 they stalk the seals on the ice, or wait by breathing holes in the ice for seals to appear. Over the past 50 years, as the sea ice has shrunk, the number of polar bears has fallen, studies show.\u00a0\n\"They're using [the fat from the seal] for everything: growth, maintenance, reproduction, keeping their body warm,\" says Smith. \"They just need a seal and some water and they're fine. They're unusual animals,\" he adds. They can subsist on this high-fat, seal-based diet without suffering any nutritional deficits, he says: \"It's a metabolic marvel\".\nWhen they can't access seals and instead resort to less fatty prey on land, such as Arctic birds, bird eggs, or food from dumps, the bears' health and reproduction rates decline, and they risk starvation, studies suggest. Polar bears on land lose around one kilogramme of body mass a day, research shows.\u00a0\n\"Part of the problem we have with climate change is the scale of change is so rapid,\" says Smith. There's not enough time for the highly specialised polar bears, who evolved to thrive on a diet of marine mammals, to adapt to permanently being on land again, he warns: \"We're fearful this animal can't possibly adapt back to a land-based, herbivorous diet.\" If they had to be on land constantly, \"as a species, they would die\", he says.\u00a0\nSmith and other researchers are appealing to governments to provide funding to help secure rubbish dumps near coastal villages from bears. \"It's extremely expensive. They need help. It wouldn't be asking too much to secure the garbage and make it safer for people, and for bears,\" he says. Otherwise, people confronted with growing numbers of bears in their villages may kill them to stay safe, he warns: \"It is extremely unfortunate to see bears die from such a preventable cause [as unsecured garbage].\"\nIn the town of Churchill, Canada, closing an open dump, along with other measures, decreased damage and human injury. Smith and his colleagues are also studying a range of additional steps to help communities co-exist with polar bears, such as bear spray.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The huskies that revealed the rapid shrinking of Greenland's ice\n\u2022 Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change\n\u2022 The deep ocean photographer that captured a 'living fossil'\nWhile the real-life human-bear conflict is playing out, humans around the world still love seeing polar bears in pictures, the reaction to Kokh's photos suggests. In a video call, he shows a wealth of artwork and even tattoos which people made as the photos went viral.\u00a0\n\"This was an absolutely crazy time, because I got so many emails and interview requests, and many people were talking to me about these images. And they were saying something like: 'this is a post-apocalyptic picture, this is how our planet will look like if we continue to do the same things with the planet and won't change our ways',\" he says.\nFor Kokh, the award-winning photos of the polar bears opened many doors, and he has been on other expeditions to take photos of many kinds of marine wildlife. But as he reflects on that storm-swept journey to Chukotka, he comes back to the relationship between people and polar bears. For a start, even in that incredibly remote, wild region, you come across human rubbish, he says: \"What you see in this area of Russian Arctic, it's abandoned barrels, fuel barrels. It's a commonly known problem because in the Soviet Union they brought thousands of fuel barrels and abandoned them, because it was expensive to bring them back. And they still lie there, and polar bears are roaming around them.\" In the photo series of the abandoned weather station, for example, there is a shot of the bears standing in a landscape of scattered barrels.\u00a0\nBut Kokh also points out that the images can be interpreted in different ways \u2013 as a warning about our impact on the planet, but also, as testimony to the power and resilience of nature.\u00a0\n\"When I was taking the picture, I was thinking about the striking contrast between the living animals, and these destroyed buildings,\" he says, and holds up a bottle, and a cup: \"You know, all the things we make \u2013 this bottle, this cup \u2013 all the things made by humans, will be destroyed one day and will cease to exist, if we don't continue to make them. If humanity will fail, nothing will remain of us. But life will still exist.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

He has not played since a disappointing run in England's dismal Champions Trophy campaign.\nAs a key player across Tests, 50-overs and T20 he will have a packed schedule if, as England plan, he is to play all matches.\nEngland's priorities this year are two huge Test series - against India at home this summer and the Ashes in Australia this winter. \nKey said he would consider \"every option\" last month and in selecting Brook he has allowed Stokes, who has struggled with injuries in recent years and is currently out with a hamstring issue, to concentrate on the Test side.\nBrook's first series as skipper will be three ODIs and three T20s against West Indies, which begin on 29 May - four days after a Test against Zimbabwe. The series ends on 10 June which is 10 days before the start of the India series.\nAfter that, England do not play again in white-ball cricket until series against South Africa and Ireland in September. There is also a white-ball tour to New Zealand in early November before the Ashes begins on 21 November.\nBrook's first International Cricket Council event will be the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which follows the Ashes in February and March next year.\nEngland's white-ball sides have largely struggled since winning the 2022 T20 World Cup to become the first men's team to hold both global limited-overs titles.\nDisappointing defences of their titles at the 2023 World Cup in India and 2024 T20 edition in the Caribbean led to Matthew Mott being sacked as coach and heaped pressure on Buttler, who stood down after an underwhelming Champions Trophy.\n\"It's a real honour to be named England's white-ball captain,\" Brook said.\n\"Ever since I was a kid playing cricket at Burley in Wharfedale, I dreamed of representing Yorkshire, playing for England, and maybe one day leading the team. To now be given that chance means a great deal to me.\n\"There's so much talent in this country, and I'm looking forward to getting started, moving us forward, and working towards winning series, World Cups and major events.\"\n'That ship has sailed' - Root rules out ODI captaincy\nStokes considered as England white-ball captain",

Three people died in Kentucky while Indiana, Mississippi, Georgia and Arkansas have also reported deaths from the storm.\nThe fierce weather has caused rivers to swell and the National Weather Service warned that dozens of locations would reach \"major flood stage\" even as the rain slows down.\nAs many as nine million Americans were under a flood watch on Monday, US media reported.\nIn Kentucky, a nine-year-old boy was swept away by floodwaters while walking to his school bus stop. His body was found two hours later.\nIn Missouri, 16-year-old volunteer firefighter Chevy Gall died in a crash while trying to rescue people caught in the storm. \n\"Chevy died while answering the call to help others,\" said local Fire Chief Terry Feth. \n\"Our entire department is grieving, as we mourn with Chevy's family, friends, and our fellow first responders during this incredibly difficult time.\"\nIn Little Rock, Arkansas, a five-year-old boy was killed by a tree that fell into his home, destroying it.\nIn Georgia, a father and son were both killed on Sunday while playing golf. According to a coroner's report, Matthew Terrell Collins Sr, 58, and Matthew Terrell Collins Jr, 29, died when a tree fell on their golf cart.\nA GoFundMe campaign launched to raise money for the Collins family described: \"They were spending time together when the storm struck - sharing a moment between father and son that would unknowingly become their last.\"\nSwollen rivers flooded cities such as Frankfort, Kentucky, prompting mandatory evacuations in some areas.\n\"As long as I've been alive - and I'm 52 - this is the worst I've ever seen it,\" Frankfort resident Wendy Quire told AP News on Sunday.\n\"The rain just won't stop,\" she added. \"It's been nonstop for days and days.\"\nOn Monday, the storm pushed across the country towards the coast, bringing severe rainfall to Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. \nThe National Weather Service warned that despite less rain in the forecast for the rest of the week, it could take days or weeks for water to recede in some locations. \nThe Augusta National Golf Club, currently hosting the high-profile Masters Tournament, was forced to evacuate on Monday morning.\nBuffalo Trace Distillery, a well-known bourbon company in Kentucky, was forced to temporarily close because of the storms. The company said in a statement it plans to remain closed until Thursday.\nIt has been a punishing week of weather for the Midwest.

        "article_text": "The Great Gatsby is synonymous with parties, glitz and glamour \u2013 but this is just one of many misunderstandings about the book that began with its first publication a century ago, in April 1925.\nFew characters in literature or indeed life embody an era quite so tenaciously as Jay Gatsby does the Jazz Age. Almost a century after he was written into being, F Scott Fitzgerald's doomed romantic has become shorthand for decadent flappers, champagne fountains and never-ending parties. Cut loose by pop culture from the text into which he was born, his name adorns everything from condominiums to hair wax and a limited-edition cologne (it contains notes of vetiver, pink pepper and Sicilian lime). It's now possible to lounge on a Gatsby sofa, check in at the Gatsby hotel, even chow down on a Gatsby sandwich \u2013 essentially a supersize, souped-up chip butty.\nIncongruous though that last item sounds, naming anything after the man formerly known as James Gatz seems more than a touch problematic. After all, flamboyant host is just one part of his complicated identity. He's also a bootlegger, up to his neck in criminal enterprise, not to mention a delusional stalker whose showmanship comes to seem downright tacky. If he embodies the potential of the American Dream, then he also illustrates its limitations: here is a man, let's not forget, whose end is destined to be as pointless as it is violent.\nMisunderstanding has been a part of The Great Gatsby's story from the very start. Grumbling to his friend Edmund Wilson shortly after the novel was published in April 1925, Fitzgerald declared that \"of all the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about\". Fellow writers like Edith Wharton admired it plenty, but as the critic Maureen Corrigan relates in her book So We Read On: How The Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why It Endures, popular reviewers read it as crime fiction, and were decidedly underwhelmed by it at that. Fitzgerald's Latest A Dud, ran a headline in the New York World. The novel achieved only so-so sales, and by the time of the author's death in 1940, copies of a very modest second print run had long since been remaindered.\nGatsby's luck began to change when it was selected as a giveaway by the US military. With World War Two drawing to a close, almost 155,000 copies were distributed in a special Armed Services Edition, creating a new readership overnight. As the 1950s dawned, the flourishing of the American Dream quickened the novel's topicality, and by the 1960s, it was enshrined as a set text. It's since become such a potent force in pop culture that even those who've never read it feel as if they have, helped along, of course, by Hollywood. It was in 1977, just a few short years after Robert Redford starred in the title role of an adaptation scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, that\u00a0the word \"Gatsbyesque\" was first recorded.\nAlong with Baz Luhrmann's divisive 2013 film extravaganza, the book has spawned graphic novels, an immersive theatrical experience and a television film, broadcast in 2000, with Paul Rudd, Toby Stephens and Mira Sorvino. And since the novel's copyright expired in 2021, enabling anyone to adapt it without permission from its estate, the Gatsby industry has exploded. Early calls for a Muppets adaptation may have come to nothing (never say never), but a musical with songs by Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine opened (and closed) on Broadway last year; a separate, Tony-winning musical, The Great Gatsby, is still running on Broadway and is about to open in London; and author Min Jin Lee and cultural critic Wesley Morris both wrote fresh introductions to 2021 editions of the book.\nIf this all leaves Fitzgerald purists twiddling their pearls like worry beads, it's quite possible that while some such projects may further perpetuate the myth that throwing a Gatsby-themed party could be anything other than sublimely clueless, others may yield fresh insights into a text whose very familiarity often leads us to skate over its complexities. Take, for instance, Michael Farris Smith's new novel, Nick. The title refers, of course, to Nick Carraway, the narrator of Gatsby, who here gets his own fully formed backstory. It's the tale of a Midwesterner who goes off to Europe to fight in World War One and comes back changed, as much by a whirlwind love affair in Paris as by trench warfare. There's room for an impulsive sojourn in the New Orleans underworld before he heads off to Long Island's West Egg.\nLike many, Smith first encountered the novel in high school. \"I just completely didn\u2019t get it\", he tells the BBC, from his home in Oxford, Mississippi. \"They seemed like a lot of people complaining about things they really shouldn't be complaining about.\" It was only when he picked it up again while living abroad in his late 20s that he began to understand the novel's power. \"It was a very surreal reading experience for me. It seemed like something on almost every page was speaking to me in a way I had not expected,\" he recalls.\nReaching the scene in which Carraway suddenly remembers it's his 30th birthday, Smith was filled with questions about what kind of a person Gatsby's narrator really was. \"It seemed to me that there had been some real trauma that had made him so detached, even from his own self. The thought crossed my mind that it would be really interesting if someone were to write Nick's story,\" he says. In 2014, by then a published author in his 40s, he sat down to do just that, telling neither his agent nor his editor. It was only when he delivered the manuscript 10 months later that he learned copyright law meant he'd have to wait until 2021 to publish it.\nSmith points to a quote from one of Fitzgerald's contemporaries as having provided the key to understanding Carraway. \"Ernest Hemingway says in [his memoir] A Moveable Feast that we didn't trust anyone who wasn't in the war, and to me that felt like a natural beginning for Nick.\" Smith imagines Carraway, coping with PTSD and shellshock, returning home to a nation that he no longer recognises. It's a far cry from the riotous razzmatazz of all that partying, yet Carraway is, Smith suggests, the reason Fitzgerald's novel remains read. \"Maybe it's not the champagne and the dancing, maybe it is those feelings of wondering where we are, the sense that anything can crumble at any moment, that keep Gatsby meaningful from one generation to the next.\"\nMore like this:\nWilliam Cain, an expert in American literature and the Mary Jewett Gaiser Professor of English at Wellesley College, agrees that Nick is crucial to understanding the novel's richness. \"Fitzgerald gave some thought to structuring it in the third person but ultimately he chose Nick Carraway, a first-person narrator who would tell Gatsby's story, and who would be an intermediary between us and Gatsby. We have to respond to and understand Gatsby and, as we do so, remain aware that we're approaching him through Nick's very particular perspective, and through Nick's very ambivalent relationship to Gatsby, which is simultaneously full of praise and full of severe criticism, even at some moments contempt,\" he says.\nLike Smith, Cain first encountered the novel as a student. It was a different era \u2013 the 1960s \u2013 but even so, little attention was paid to Nick. Cain recalls instead talk of symbolism \u2013 the legendary green light, for example, and Gatsby's fabled automobile. It's a reminder that, in a way, the education system is as much to blame as pop culture for our limited readings of this seminal text. It may be a Great American Novel but, at fewer than 200 pages, its sublimely economical storytelling makes its study points very easy to access. Ironically, given that this is a novel of illusion and delusion, in which surfaces are crucial, we all too often overlook the texture of its prose. As Cain puts it, \"I think when we consider The Great Gatsby, we need to think about it not just as a novel that is an occasion or a point of departure for us to talk about big American themes and questions, but we have to really enter into the richness of Fitzgerald's actual page-to-page writing. We have to come to Gatsby, yes, aware of its social and cultural significance, but also we need to return to it as a literary experience.\"\nCain re-reads the novel every two or three years but frequently finds himself thinking about it in between \u2013 in 2020, for instance, when US President Biden, accepting the Democratic nomination at the DNC, spoke of the right to pursue dreams of a better future. The American Dream is, of course, another of Gatsby's Big Themes, and one that continues to be misunderstood. \"Fitzgerald shows that that dream is very powerful, but that it is indeed a very hard one for most Americans to realise. It feeds them great hopes, great desires, and it's extraordinary, the efforts that so many of them make to fulfil those dreams and those desires, but that dream is beyond the reach of many, and many, they give up all too much to try to achieve that great success,\" Cain points out. Among the obstacles, Fitzgerald seems to suggest, are hard-and-fast class lines that no amount of money will enable Gatsby to cross. It's a view that resonates with a mood that Cain says he's been picking up on among his students \u2013 a certain \"melancholy\" for the American Dream, the feeling fanned by racial and economic inequalities that the pandemic has only deepened.\nIn other certain respects, the novel hasn't worn quite so well. While Fitzgerald showed where his allegiances lay by highlighting the brute ugliness of Tom Buchanan's white supremacist beliefs, he repeatedly describes African Americans as \"bucks\". The novel makes for frustrating reading from a feminist perspective, too: its female characters lack dimensionality and agency, and are seen instead through the prism of male desire. But the path is now open to endless creative responses to those more dated and unpleasant aspects. Jane Crowther's newly published novel, Gatsby, updates the plot to the 21st Century, and flips the genders to feature a female Jay Gatsby and a male Danny Buchanan. And Claire Anderson-Wheeler's The Gatsby Gambit is a murder mystery which invents a younger sister for Fitzgerald's eponymous anti-hero: Greta Gatsby \u2013 get it?\nTo an impressive degree, however, the renewed attention brought by the copyright expiry and the centenary shows not just how relevant and seductive the text of Fitzgerald's novel remains, but how very alive it's always been. Pick it up at 27, and you'll find a different novel to the one you read as a teenager. Revisit it again at 45, and it'll feel like another book altogether. Copyright has never had any bearing on the impact of the words it governs.\nWhen Smith was finally able to publish Nick in 2021, he returned once more to The Great Gatsby before turning in his last edit. \"I think it will be a novel that's always evolving in my head, and always changing based on who I am,\" he says. \"That's what great novels do.\"\nA version of this article was originally published in 2021.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",
