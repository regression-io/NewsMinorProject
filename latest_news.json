Congrats to him - he did a great job,\" Garcia said.\nGarcia was competing for the first time since serving a one-year doping ban after testing positive for banned substance ostarine following his victory over Haney in April 2024, which was overturned into a no-contest.\n\"A whole year took a lot of my body physically and mentally,\" Garcia said, adding that he would now go \"back to the drawing board\".\nEarlier, Haney, 26, kept his side of the bargain with a unanimous yet underwhelming  win against fellow American Jose Carlos Ramirez.\nHaney boxed on the back foot as neither fighter threw anything of note in a forgettable 12-round contest.\nIn the performance of the night, American two-weight world champion Teofimo Lopez defended his WBO light-welterweight title with a stylish points win over compatriot Arnold Barboza Jr.\nFormer undisputed lightweight champion Devin Haney (left) extended his record to 32 professional wins\nOrganisers in Saudi Arabia were lining up the rematch for later this year, as long as Haney and Garcia won.\nAfter a year lay-off, an overly cautious Haney, who was dropped three times by Garcia last year, never really got going in a below-par showing.\nHe circled around the ring, landing the occasional lead left hook, but neglected his jab as single shots did enough to edge the rounds.\nDefensively, it was a sound performance by Haney, largely because gun-shy Ramirez did so little.\nThe judges scored it 119-109, 119-109 and 118-110.\nThe bout was best summed up by Scotland's former undisputed light-welterweight world champion Josh Taylor, who said on social media that Haney looked \"terrified\" and \"frantic\".\nHaney-Ramirez sapped the 'Big Apple' of its energy and vibe but the early drama in the headline bout lifted the mood.\nRomero landed a stinging double left hook to floor Garcia. It was a flush and hurtful punch which he later followed with a clubbing right before Garcia regained his senses.\nWith both fighters unwilling to over-commit, Romero edged the rounds with better use of the jab, coupled with Garcia's tentativeness.\n\"Get busy,\" trainer Derrick James pleaded with Garcia before the championship rounds.\nThe pep talk had no impact as Romero landed a combination to head and body in the 11th.

        "article_text": "In January a migrant boat was rescued off the north African coast after 14 harrowing days lost at sea. Some 50 people died on the voyage, many of whom were lied to by people smugglers promising safe and legal routes to Europe. BBC Verify has tracked one of the traffickers responsible - documenting his activities across three continents.\nPunjabi rap music plays over a video showing three men at a beachside restaurant in Mauritania's capital Nouakchott. One after the other, they smile at the camera before casually turning to talk and laugh together.\nThe three are clearly friends. Two of them, Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad, are cousins from rural Pakistan.\nBut it's the third man in particular who dominates the conversation. He's Fadi Gujjar, a people smuggler.\nThe video - posted to Gujjar's TikTok account - is one of more than 450 clips analysed by BBC Verify that reveal clues about his activities and his close relationship to the other men.\nWithin a month of this video being posted online, Ali and Shahzad were dead - beaten to death on the boat journey sold to them by Gujjar, who promised a safe route into Europe.\nMeanwhile, Gujjar found himself on the run, wanted by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for his role in the tragedy.\nWhen BBC Verify contacted him on a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said repeatedly in a series of voice notes his name had been \"misused\" by survivors in connection with the disaster and that he was leaving it all in the hands of Allah.\nFadi Gujjar is from Jaurah in Pakistan's Punjab region. In his 30s, his real name is Khawar Hassan - though he also goes by Bishi Gujjar.\nPakistani smugglers the BBC has previously reported on have tended to boastfully advertise illegal routes to Europe online.\nBut Gujjar is careful. His online presence is limited to highly edited videos of his travels and almost all clients BBC Verify identified are local to Jaurah. Advertisements for his services seem to spread by word of mouth.\nHis current location on Facebook is set to Istanbul, Turkey - an oasis for smugglers looking to make a quick buck. Videos posted to TikTok place him in the city since July 2022, showing the smuggler outside the iconic Hagia Sophia and a Pakistani supermarket.\nOne other location stands out: Mauritania on West Africa's Atlantic coast - the nerve-centre of his operation and the place from which the migrant boat started its perilous journey.\nSince 2023, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says Mauritania has become a hub for people smuggling - spurred on by a crackdown on other routes.\nThe route is deadly. IOM data shows that 170 people - including 14 children - have died or gone missing on it this year.\nMany Pakistanis seeking economic opportunities in Europe are willing to take the risk. Life there is glorified online by migrants already living on the continent. Smugglers like Gujjar, whose lucrative business is fuelled by people's aspirations, take advantage of this.\nThese migrants are taking a gamble, using their families' savings or selling up to make the journey. The survivors we spoke to, on average, say they paid Gujjar $13,000 (\u00a310,000).\nThere are no direct flights from Pakistan to Mauritania, so some of the migrants transited through Ethiopia or the Middle East. From there, almost all of them went on to Senegal, before crossing into Mauritania, either by road or a short boat journey along the Senegal River.\nGujjar's travel history - obtained by BBC Verify through a source - showed the smuggler followed a similar route, entering Dakar airport in Senegal on two occasions in 2024.\nMultiple videos also place him in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott from October 2024 - though the date of upload could differ to when they were filmed.\nFurther clips, posted to TikTok by Ali and Shahzad place Gujjar in Mauritania as early as August 2024. The trio are seen on the rooftops of Nouakchott's sand-coloured buildings and in restaurants around the city - a luxury other migrants couldn't afford.\nVideos from their accounts reveal the men were close, hailing from the same village. Their uncle, Ahsan Shahzad Chaudhry, confirmed to BBC Verify that his nephew Sufian Ali was friends with Gujjar.\nOne survivor named Uzair Bhat said Gujjar falsely promised him safe and legal routes to Europe. He sent BBC Verify proof of funds transferred to a bank account under Gujjar's real name, Khawar Hassan.\nBut when Uzair arrived in Mauritania, the smuggler backtracked.\n\"He said going by air will not work from here. I'll send you by a big ship,\" Uzair recalled. \"Please cooperate, your visa [to Europe] won't come through.\" \nEventually Uzair relented.\nAs well as Ali, Shahzad and Uzair, BBC Verify identified two other migrants who bought journeys from Gujjar.\nOnce they arrived in Nouakchott they say they were placed in \"safe houses\" - a term used for buildings tucked away in obscure alleys where migrants are held illegally by smugglers.\nOne person who used a different agent said he also stayed in safe houses run by Gujjar.\nBBC Verify confirmed the location of one to an area near the port of Nouakchott, which survivors say Gujjar occasionally visited.\nSurvivors BBC Verify spoke to say they set off from Nouakchott in a small fishing boat in the early hours on 2 January. Most of those onboard bought passage from smugglers in their hometowns in Pakistan.\nBut the three day trip turned into a deadly two-week journey adrift at sea. \nUzair said that from the day they left port the migrants \"were constantly scooping water out of the boat\". Another man, Bilalwal Iqbal, recalled that passengers soon began \"drinking sea water and after drinking it, people became delirious\".\nAccording to the survivors, the crew onboard - West Africans employed by the smugglers - starved the Pakistani migrants of food and water, and beat them daily.\n\"I tried to take one of their bottles of water so they hit me on the head with a rope and the impact just made me fall back,\" Iqbal told BBC Verify. \"Then they pummelled my thumbs with a hammer. I still have those wounds.\"\nSufian Ali and Atif Shahzad died after being beaten to death by the crew, their uncle said. He was informed of the circumstances surrounding their deaths by survivors.\nOthers died of starvation, dehydration and hypothermia.\nThose still alive, including the crew, had given up until they saw a much larger fishing vessel come into view. Uzair Bhat jumped into the ocean and swam towards it for help.\nThe coastguard instructed the vessel to take the migrant boat to Dakhla port - 60 miles away. According to the IOM, 15 dead bodies were found onboard while 35 people remain missing at sea and presumed dead.\nPakistani authorities have named Gujjar as one of ten smugglers involved in the tragedy. Some have been arrested, but not Gujjar.\nBBC Verify geolocated his most recent TikTok posts to Baku, Azerbaijan - though we cannot say for certain if he is still there.\nSince news of the rescue broke, his mother and one of his brothers have been detained in Pakistan, accused of collecting money on Gujjar's behalf from people buying routes to Europe.\nBBC Verify has also seen six police reports filed in Punjab by the families of those on the boat journey. They allege Gujjar collected $75,000 (\u00a356,000) for his role in the January disaster. Three people paid in full, while the remaining three had only paid deposits, the police reports said.\nWe believe Gujjar was still facilitating journeys to Europe after the boat disaster in January.\nContacted by an undercover BBC reporter in March using a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said he \"knew someone\" who would help arrange a journey, but did not directly offer to get involved himself.\nAdditional reporting by Dilay Yal\u00e7in, Javed Sumroo and Joshua Cheetham. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

They are also known to have stolen data as part of their extortion tactics.DragonForce operates an affiliate cyber crime service so anyone can use their malicious software and website to carry out attacks and extortions.It's not known who is ultimately using the DragonForce service to attack the retailers, but some security experts say the tactics seen are similar to that of a loosely coordinated group of hackers who have been called Scattered Spider or Octo Tempest.The gang operates on Telegram and Discord channels and is English-speaking and young \u2013 in some cases only teenagers.Conversations with the Co-op hackers were carried out in text form - but it is clear the hacker, who called himself a spokesperson, was a fluent English speaker.They say two of the hackers want to be known as \"Raymond Reddington\" and \"Dembe Zuma\" after characters from US crime thriller Blacklist which involves a wanted criminal helping police take down other criminals on a 'blacklist'. \"This data includes Co-op Group members' personal data such as names and contact details, and did not include members' passwords, bank or credit card details, transactions or information relating to any members' or customers' products or services with the Co-op Group,\" a spokesperson said.DragonForce want the BBC to report the hack - they are apparently trying to extort the company for money.",

The vehicle is currently in Bethlehem, and will enter Gaza if and when Israel opens a humanitarian corridor.\nThe war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 15,000 children and displaced nearly one million since it erupted in October 2023, Unicef reports. \nIsrael has blocked humanitarian aid from entering the Strip for more than two months, which has left \"families struggling to survive\" as food, clean water and medicines reach critically low levels, the UN agency for children said.\nFor now, Caritas will have to wait until Israel reopens the aid corridor - but when that happens, they say they will be ready.\n\"With the vehicle, we will be able to reach children who today have no access to health care \u2013 children who are injured and malnourished,\" Peter Brune, Secretary General of Caritas Sweden, said in a statement.\nA team of doctors will run the mobile clinic, which will have the capabilities to examine and treat patients, and there will be a dedicated driver. Some details are still being finalised, like how to make the vehicle safe from potential blasts, Mr Brune told the BBC.\n\"It's not just a vehicle, it's a message that the world has not forgotten about the children in Gaza,\" he said.\nThroughout his pontificate, Pope Francis made many impassioned remarks on the war in Gaza, calling the humanitarian situation in the Strip \"shamefull\". During his final speech on Easter Sunday, he urged all \"warring parties\" to agree to a ceasefire and spoke of the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis. \nDuring 18 months of war, he reportedly called parishioners in Gaza nightly to check on their wellbeing, and suggested that the international community should examine whether Israel's military offensive in Gaza should be classed as genocide \u2013 an allegation Israel has vehemently denied.\nThe popemobile is one of a number of specially converted vehicles allowing the pontiff to greet huge crowds of well-wishers during official visits. He was able to sit or stand while it rolled along, flanked by security agents, and its design allowed those gathered to have a clear view of the Pope. \nPopemobiles in the past were bullet-proof after an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981, but Francis told Spanish media in 2014 that he didn't like the glass \"sardine can\" design that separated him from people.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages.\nIsrael's military campaign has killed at least 52,243 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nOn Monday, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved, in principle, a plan to resume deliveries and distribution of humanitarian aid through private companies, but the UN and other aid agencies said the proposal would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles and that they will not co-operate.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'You can't feel sympathy' - Besiktas' Solskjaer discusses Man Utd woes\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer bounces in as light and airy as the summer room Besiktas have allocated for our interview.\n\"I came here to get away from people like you,\" he laughs, explaining the joke to club officials through his Turkish interpreter.\nHis mood is relaxed and jovial.\nOver the next 30 minutes, Solskjaer, who is 2,000 miles from his spiritual home in Manchester and 1,700 from his actual home in Norway, reflects on the lack of contact with former United colleagues, reveals his shock at the sale of Scott McTominay and worry over what's happening to his \"family\" at Old Trafford.\nBut this is not his priority right now. He must concentrate on a massive and highly pressurised managerial role and his first experience of an Istanbul derby away from home, when Besiktas face Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce on Sunday.\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has won seven of his 14 games in charge of Besiktas\nIt is an important game. Besiktas need a result to maintain hopes of a third-place finish which, depending on who wins the Turkish Cup final, offers a Europa League play-off spot rather than a place in the second qualifying round.\n\"That's the deal I have made,\" Solskjaer says. \"It is more important than an extra few quid. If we get third, the players get an extra week off in the summer.\"\nFenerbahce are chasing the third - and currently dominant - Istanbul team, Galatasaray, for the title. Heading into the weekend, they are five points behind, with five games left. They cannot afford to slip up. Who knows what Mourinho has in store to turn the situation his way.\nIt is against this backdrop that Solskjaer has agreed to speak at length to BBC Sport for the first time since he lost his job at Manchester United in October 2021. Like Mourinho before him, the Norwegian paid the price for regression the season after he finished second.\nBesiktas are very much his club now. But events at Old Trafford are never far from his mind.\n\"Man United is my family and will always be part of me,\" he says.\n\"In football, you don't feel sorry for anyone because we are privileged, absolutely 100% privileged to be able to work in clubs like this.\n\"But for me, it is hard to watch because it is your family that is struggling. It is never easy at the weekend when you look at the table.\"\nHe is talking with incredulity about the fact United, at the time of this meeting, are 14th in the Premier League.\nThey were seventh when he was dismissed after a 4-1 defeat at Watford. Two months before that they had been third, behind leaders Chelsea on goal difference.\nBut a terrible run of results, including a record 5-0 home defeat by Liverpool and 2-0 loss to Manchester City at Old Trafford where the scoreline massively flattered United, meant Solskjaer knew what was coming as the Watford debacle unfolded.\nIt has taken him a long time to return. Why Besiktas?\n\"You have not been here long enough,\" he says with a smile.\n\"The club is fantastic. I spoke to a lot without doing anything about it. This was the only one I spoke to where I looked back afterwards and thought 'I wish I was there' because there is so much potential.\n\"You feel the identity and culture in the club is aligned with you; the values about honesty, community work. We were the first club in Turkey to go abroad to play. It is very similar to Man United in that sense. It just reminded me of Man United when I was there.\"\nThe pay-off is telling.\nSolskjaer signed Maguire and made him captain at United\nAt United, Solskjaer had tried to instil the 'look after everyone' mentality he knew so well from Sir Alex Ferguson's time.\nHe took that approach from the first day he returned to United's Carrington training ground after taking an SOS call from then executive chairman Ed Woodward in December 2018.\nWoodward wanted Solskjaer to bring a smile back to the face of a club that had turned toxic as Mourinho's tenure drew to a close amid rancour and recrimination.\nThe new boss handed out chocolate bars to staff members \u2013 something he used to do in his own playing days. Beloved receptionist Kath Phipps was the first recipient. Solskjaer flew in for Phipps' funeral in January 2025. He went on to the wake, which was populated by so many of the old guard.\nSolskjaer noted that day, as did so many others, there seemed to be a disconnect between United's current leadership and the past.\nWe meet a day after United have beaten Atletico Bilbao to plant one foot into the Europa League final. His elation for players he knows well comes with a shocking revelation given his knowledge of the club and the advice he could offer, plus the elevated position he holds from his playing days, which goes far beyond a single \u2013 iconic \u2013 goal at the Nou Camp.\n\"For me, Harry [Maguire] has always been a leader and a fighter,\" Solskjaer says.\n\"I was never in doubt when I signed him and he walked in the door he would be captain for us.\n\"There is another captain there in Bruno [Fernandes]. The two of them are top human beings. I was so happy for them last night.\n\"Those two and Victor [Lindelof] are probably the only ones still at the club that I have heard from since I left. You want the best for them.\"\nHe doesn't say it \u2013 and wouldn't because by his nature he is not one to take cheap shots and he will never alter the fundamentals he took from his parents and has tried to pass on as a husband and father \u2013 but the lack of communication hurts.\nAn example of his values is shown a few minutes later when he is walking across from the Besiktas training ground from the summer house to the main building to get his lunch.\nTwo young supporters spot him and ask for autographs and selfies. Not only does he oblige, he stops 19-year-old Ecuador winger Keny Arroyo, a \u00a36.4m February arrival, who is about to walk past, to make sure he does the same.\nScott McTominay has helped Napoli lead Serie A with a flurry of goals since his move from Manchester United \nThere is a strong Manchester United undercurrent to the next game for Solskjaer.\nWorking with him at Besiktas is former United goalkeeping coach Richard Hartis and Tom Green, who left his job at United's senior performance analyst in February to take on the head of analysis role at the Turkish club.\nPlaying for Mourinho is former United midfielder Sofyan Amrabat and also a player Solskjaer knows very well in Fred, the Brazilian half of United's one-time 'McFred' midfield axis, alongside Scott McTominay.\nTalking about this offers an opportunity to despair at the recruitment and sales decisions his old club have taken, including allowing McTominay to join Napoli.\n\"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%,\" Solskjaer says.\n\"How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\"\nMourinho and Solskjaer last met in 2021 when the Portuguese was manager of Tottenham\nSolskjaer assesses the work ahead of him in a pragmatic way. From a detached perspective, it seems many of the challenges he is facing are similar to those Ruben Amorim is experiencing at United.\nTo that end, a Europa League win could be crucial in buying Amorim time. It is something United came within a missed David de Gea penalty of achieving when Solskjaer's team were beaten by Unai Emery's Villarreal in the 2021 final.\n\"Everyone knows you need time to shape a team into what you want it to look like,\" said Solskjaer.\n\"But you have to manage it the best you can, not as you wish it was. There are things I want my team to do that this one can't. We have come into a difficult financial period because in the past the club has spent money, maybe not so wisely.\"\nI point out that is an observation I have heard about another club close to his heart. Solskjaer is about to answer but checks himself.\n\"Yes. But that's, you know when you\u2026\u2026.actually, I don't have to say that,\" he said.\n\"Look, recruitment is probably the most important thing in football.\n\"You need the structures right and you need to get the right people in.\n\"When you manage two, three, four or five different managers' players, it is hard to make it balance into a team you want to see. Everyone knows you need continuity and patience to get success, but not too many get it.\"\nSolskjaer has not spoken to Mourinho since his arrival in Turkey and says he is looking forward to meeting him again.\nI remind him of their spat in April 2021 \u2013 a week before Mourinho was sacked by Tottenham \u2013 when the Portuguese reacted badly to Solskjaer claiming Son Heung-min had cheated to ensure a United goal was disallowed.\n\"I would not feed my son if he behaved like that,\" chided the Norwegian at the time. Mourinho's response was classic: \"Sonny is very lucky his father is a better person than Ole. As a father, you always have to feed your kids, even if you have to steal.\"\n\"I remember that one,\" shrugs Solskjaer. \"You look after your own team.\n\"He has all the charisma of course and I don't think any of us change a lot when we have come this far.\n\"It will be good to see him again and hopefully the headlines will be about the team and the football that is played and nothing else.\"\nBesiktas beat Galatasaray on 29 March but have won just once in four games since.\nSolskjaer knows the atmosphere at the Sukru Saracoglu stadium will be white hot.\n\"I saw from Gala, when you are at home and winning these games there is nothing better,\" he says.\n\"If you are at home and you don't win, there is nothing worse.\n\"Football is decided by moments. You see last night [Thursday], Athletic had two or three massive chances and Victor saves one on the goal line. Then it all changes.\n\"The margins between winning and losing in football are so close. It is better to be lucky than good sometimes.\n\"Hopefully, it will be one of Jose's bad nights.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'What a performance!' Zhao beats O'Sullivan with session to spare\nSeven-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan suffered a 17-7 loss to a dominant Zhao Xintong as his World Championship semi-final came to an end a session early.\nZhao, 28, becomes only the second player from Asia to reach a Crucible final, nine years after his Chinese compatriot Ding Junhui was runner-up to Mark Selby in 2016.\nLeading 12-4, Zhao compiled breaks of 62 and 128 to dash any hopes O'Sullivan had of building some momentum after taking the first two frames of Friday's evening session.\nWhile O'Sullivan, who is level on seven Crucible crowns in the modern era with Stephen Hendry, took the first frame after the mid-session interval, Zhao exhibited an incredible temperament to round off the match. \nIn front of a crowd overwhelmingly urging 49-year-old O'Sullivan to take the contest into Saturday, Zhao compiled breaks of 85, 63 and 88 to seal the most famous victory of his career.\n\"I can't believe that. I need to say thank you to Ronnie because he has helped me a lot before. He's my idol,\" Zhao told BBC Sport.\n\"It's my first time playing on the single table here, it's an amazing time for me and I just want to enjoy it because I don't know how many times I can try to enjoy it here.\n\"I've played here and sometimes the crowd is helpful for Ronnie and he deserves that, he is a legend here so I needed to control myself.\"\nZhao's scintillating showing on Friday morning laid the platform when he became only the fourth player to win a session 8-0 against O'Sullivan at the Crucible.\nIt was reminiscent of the form he displayed on his way to the UK title in 2021 and he was able to maintain that later in the day to become only the second player since John Parrott in 1994 to defeat O'Sullivan with a session to spare at snooker's most famous venue.\nO'Sullivan, who has won a record 41 ranking events, has made no secret about struggling with his cue since snapping his old one at the Championship League in January.\nHe turned up for his first-round match against Ali Carter with two cues from different manufacturers and has been constantly tinkering ever since.\nThat included two mid-match changes to his tip against Zhao and switching his ferrule from titanium to brass.\nHowever, it did not have the desired impact as he missed a series of regulation pots against an opponent who punished him in ruthless fashion.\n\"I just felt like I never gave him a game so that's a bit disappointing,\" said O'Sullivan.\n\"Zhao deserved his victory. I think he's done brilliantly all tournament and all credit to Zhao. He played better than me.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan has only lost one other match at the Crucible before the scheduled final session\nIn the afternoon session in Sheffield, Judd Trump looked set to establish a big lead when he pulled 7-3 ahead of Mark Williams, but the veteran Welshman reined in the 2019 champion to leave the pair at 8-8 overnight.\nTrump, whose glory run six years ago gave him his only Crucible crown to date, extended his overnight lead from 5-3 by taking the opening two frames.\nBut Welshman Williams, 50, who is aiming to become the oldest ever Crucible finalist, rallied to take five of the next six frames on offer.\nJust as in their keenly-contested 2022 semi-final, which Trump edged 17-16, the tension was palpable.\nIt was underlined by Williams uncharacteristically hitting his own cue in frustration when he thought he had given up the opportunity to win the 15th frame, in which he eventually triumphed before rounding off the session with a composed 96.\n\"Absolute carnage.

She was studying it, and then said 'it's OK dad, I don't think they can see me crying'.\n\"That's all she was worried about.\"\nRory McIlroy beat Justin Rose in a dramatic play-off to win the Masters in April\nFor years, McIlroy had faced questions over whether he could complete the career Grand Slam.\nThere had been missed opportunities to claim the iconic green jacket - most notably after an infamous final-round collapse in 2011. \nDespite his talent and self belief, the 35-year-old admitted to wondering if he had missed his opportunity.\n\"You start to think if it is ever going to be your time,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a good message in there about never giving up and keep coming back. \n\"Be strong, be resilient and that patience paid off.\"\nThe Northern Irishman held a two-shot lead going into the final round, and said he had learnt lessons from his 2011 collapse, when he let a four-stroke advantage slip away.\n\"I wanted to make everything else irrelevant. I'm not going to look at what my playing partner is doing, I'm not going to look at the leaderboard. \n\"I was going to try and get in my own world. If I can shoot four-under-par, I'm going to win the Masters. \n\"I felt like I lost the Masters in 2011 because I started to look around and started to do maths in my head.\n\"If you give yourself a target and objective, that's all you can do.\"\nSir Elton John wanted to congratulate McIlroy on his Masters success - but he doesn't have a mobile phone\nUnsurprisingly, McIlroy has been contacted by famous people from all walks of life since his win at Augusta.\nHe said he was \"super humbled\" by those who had been in touch, but one famous musician stood out.\nSir Elton John needs little introduction - but there was one little problem.\n\"I actually haven't been able to connect with him yet. His assistant left me a voicemail and said Sir Elton would love to congratulate me in person.\n\"The only problem is he doesn't have a cell phone. They said I might get a call from Windsor in England on a landline, and I was like 'sure!'.\n\"I didn't even know that Elton John knew what golf was, so it's been really cool.\"\nTiger Woods, one of the five other players to complete the Grand Slam, had a simple but very cool message for McIlroy.\n\"Welcome to the club, kid.\"\nMcIlroy and Fallon recreated the famous clip of the golfer when he was eight years old by chipping balls into a washing machine\nMcIlroy's first appearance on a chat show wasn't in the glitz and glamour of New York, but a local TV programme in his native Northern Ireland. \nWhen he was just eight years of age, McIlroy showcased his talents by chipping balls into a washing machine on 'Kelly', replicating what he used to do in his kitchen in Holywood. \nHe recreated that moment with Fallon in a race to three successful chips. The pressure was on, as he had the famous green jacket on. \n\"As the Masters champion I absolutely should not lose to you!\" McIlroy quipped.\nThankfully for McIlroy, he delivered but, in his own words, \"I was better when I was eight!\".\nRory McIlroy is set to make an appearance alongside Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore 2\nHappy Gilmore is one of the most famous sports movies from the 1990s, and is set for a modern-day sequel that will come out later this year. \nIt's a story about an ice hockey player - played by Adam Sandler - who goes on to become the best golfer in the world despite his unique technique and temperament. \nMcIlroy said he was a huge fan of the original, and is set to make a cameo appearance in the upcoming release. \n\"Happy Gilmore was the golf movie for me growing up, I can recite almost every line,\" McIlroy said.\n\"The fact I got the opportunity to do that was awesome and Sandler is the absolute best.\n\"But I'm a much better golfer than I am an actor.\" ",

Officials had initially described that exemption as temporary, but after customs instructions issued this week analysts said it now appeared likely to stick.\nTrump this week also signed measures to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, while setting up a two-year system carmakers can use to reduce the duties they have to pay on parts imported from other countries and used in US-assembled cars.\nThe administration had also already said firms importing cars made in Canada and Mexico would not be charged tariffs on US-made content. \n\"The changes that have come in the last couple of days are going to make it easier ... but even so it's still a dramatic change to the market,\" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. \"It's still a big tariff.\"\nExecutives at some firms have said they are exploring ways to increase production in the US to mitigate the new costs. \nGeneral Motors said it had expanded truck production at its factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana, by about 50,000 as a result of the tariffs. This week it also said it would cut back output in Canada.\nMercedes also said it had flexibility to expand at its factory in Alabama.\nArt Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at Cornell University, said the US might see more such announcements in the months ahead, but he did not expect to see new factories getting built anytime soon, given the significance of that investment and how fast the situation is changing. \n\"If I'm going to make a multi-billion dollar decision... I wouldn't do it in a market that is this unstable,\" he said.\nThe administration has said it is working on trade deals with key countries for the industry, including South Korea and Japan.\nTrump might also modify his policies if signs of economic damage start to emerge, Mr Wheaton said.\n\"Everything is pretty good now,\" he said. \"I don't think the full impact of those tariffs has hit yet.\"",

So in the context of that, and his own weekend, second was not too bad.\n\"I'm very happy with the end result,\" Norris said. \"Just a shame when you miss out on pole, so that's the only frustrating bit.\n\"But I've been trying different things, I've been doing different things with the team to try and work a bit more in this area and things have been taking a step forward. So I'm happy. Maybe not quite there yet, but happy with the progress.\"\nVerstappen beats Norris to Miami pole\nNorris wins Miami sprint with help from safety car\nHis team-mate Oscar Piastri, too, felt he should have been in the fight for pole with Verstappen.\nBut the Australian, leading the championship by nine points after his third victory of the season in Saudi Arabia last time out, said he was fourth because of \"poor execution\".\nPiastri added: \"The gap has always been close, and our advantage has been a little more on Sundays, but our picture of where we stand is that if we make mistakes we are going to be beaten and that's been true through the year.\"\nTeam principal Andrea Stella says McLaren have now seen enough of a pattern to work out what has been happening to allow Verstappen to take three poles in six races.\n\"We have now enough statistics to confirm what was already our initial impression in Bahrain during the (pre-season) test,\" Stella said, \"that the car was easier to exploit in terms of performance in race simulation runs, rather than on a single lap with qualifying trim and new tyres.\n\"We have seen that pretty much so far we haven't had any perfect lap.\n\"We are definitely trying to assess on a solid engineering basis our understanding so that we can make some adjustments that our drivers can test to see if we can give them a car that is just slightly more predictable and rich of information in terms of how the grip is when driving the car at the limit.\"\nHe added: \"Just to make sure that my point is clear, it's a car that doesn't give you much 'cueing', which is the technical word we use, and this means that it's not easy for our drivers to repeat some big performances that we can see in individual laps.\"\nUpgrades are coming to try to solve this, and Red Bull have their own in Miami, a new floor that is the first of a number of developments they hope will allow Verstappen to challenge the McLaren drivers more consistently in races.\n\"What we are trying to achieve of course is a better balance in the car,\" Verstappen said. \"Now this track is not always the easiest to say that you have improved or nailed something because it's just a really weird layout I would say. So it takes a bit more time.\n\"But for sure it was not negative. And yeah, from here we can work and try to improve it further because from my feeling, of course, we're not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight.\"\nNorris beat team-mate Oscar Piastri to victory in the sprint race, narrowing the gap between them in the drivers' championship by one point\nIn McLaren's view, Red Bull have not been painting the most accurate picture of the competitive picture between the two teams.\n\"Red Bull, they are very good at making fast cars,\" Stella said. \"They are very exceptionally good, I would say, at driving fast cars, and they are extremely good also in creating the narrative to their advantage.\n\"They exploit every possible opportunity to stay in the competition, and some of these opportunities sometimes is to create the narrative, like, 'oh, we are making miracles here, the others should win every single practice session and qualifying and race.'\n\"This is the narrative created by some of our competitors, which we read occasionally and then we change the page and we focus on ourselves.\"\nThe grid sets up an intriguing race. The title contenders are in reverse order, with an interloper between Norris and Piastri in the form of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\nAnd Norris scents an opportunity to nail his first victory since the opening race of the season in Australia back in March.\nIn qualifying, he made errors at the last corner on both his laps, each time costing about 0.2secs, so he knows the pace is in the car.\n\"Max has always been good in qualifying and as a team we have struggled a little more in qualifying, whether that's set-up or what, I'm not too sure,\" Norris said.\n\"We know the Red Bulls are running high downforce, which allows them especially with the DRS (in qualifying) to be a lot more competitive. But it's a long race and we know we have good pace in both conditions.\n\"I don't just expect competition from Max. Kimi's been quick all weekend and Oscar has been as well.

        "article_text": "Last week's deadly militant attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed 26 civilian lives, has reignited a grim sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for India's security forces and diplomats.\nThis is familiar ground. In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nAnd before that, the horrific 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives.\nEach time, India has held Pakistan-based militant groups responsible for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.\nSince 2016, and especially after the 2019 airstrikes, the threshold for escalation has shifted dramatically. Cross-border and aerial strikes by India have become the new norm, provoking retaliation from Pakistan. This has further intensified an already volatile situation.\nOnce again, experts say, India finds itself walking the tightrope between escalation and restraint - a fragile balance of response and deterrence. One person who understands this recurring cycle is Ajay Bisaria, India's former high commissioner to Pakistan during the Pulwama attack, who captured its aftermath in his memoir, Anger Management: The Troubled Diplomatic Relationship between India and Pakistan.\n\"There are striking parallels between the aftermath of the Pulwama bombing and the killings in Pahalgam,\" Mr Bisaria told me on Thursday, 10 days after the latest attack.\nYet, he notes, Pahalgam marks a shift. Unlike Pulwama and Uri, which targeted security forces, this attack struck civilians - tourists from across India - evoking memories of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. \"This attack carries elements of Pulwama, but much more of Mumbai,\" he explains.\n\"We're once again in a conflict situation, and the story is unfolding in much the same way,\" Mr Bisaria says.\nA week after the latest attack, Delhi moved quickly with retaliatory measures: closing the main border crossing, suspending a key water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals - who were given days to leave. Troops on both sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border in recent days.\nDelhi also barred all Pakistani aircraft - commercial and military - from its airspace, mirroring Islamabad's earlier move. Pakistan retaliated with its own visa suspensions and suspended a 1972 peace treaty with India. (Kashmir, claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but administered in parts by each, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations since their partition in 1947.)\n\nIn his memoir, Mr Bisaria recounts India's response after the Pulwama attack on 14 February 2019. \nHe was summoned to Delhi the morning after, as the government moved quickly to halt trade - revoking Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, granted in 1996. In the following days, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) imposed a 200% customs duty on Pakistani goods, effectively ending imports, and suspended trade at the land border at  Wagah.\nMr Bisaria notes that a broader set of measures was also proposed to scale down engagement with Pakistan, most of which were subsequently implemented.\nThey included suspending a cross-border train known as the Samjhauta Express, and a bus service linking Delhi and Lahore; deferring talks between border guards on both sides and negotiations over the historic Kartarpur corridor to one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, halting visa issuance, ceasing cross border, banning Indian travel to Pakistan, and suspending flights between the two countries.\n\"How hard it was to build trust, I thought. And how easy was it to break it,\" Mr Bisaria writes.\n\"All the confidence-building measures planned, negotiated, and implemented over years in this difficult relationship, could be slashed off on a yellow notepad in minutes.\"\nThe strength of the Indian high commission in Islamabad was reduced from 110 to 55 only in June 2020 after a separate diplomatic incident. (It now stands at 30 after the Pahalgam attack.) India also launched a diplomatic offensive. \nA day after the attack, then foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale briefed envoys from 25 countries - including the US, UK, China, Russia, and France - on the role of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Pakistan-based militant group behind the bombing, and accused Pakistan of using terrorism as state policy. JeM, designated a terrorist organisation by India, the UN, the UK, and the US, had claimed responsibility for the bombing. \nIndia's diplomatic offensive continued on 25 February, 10 days after the attack, pushing for JeM chief Masood Azhar's designation as a terrorist by the UN sanctions committee and inclusion on the EU's \"autonomous terror list\".\nWhile there was pressure to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty - a key river water sharing agreement - India opted instead to withhold any data beyond treaty obligations, Mr Bisaria writes. A total of 48 bilateral agreements were reviewed for possible suspension. An all-party meeting was convened in Delhi, resulting in a unanimous resolution. \nAt the same time, communication channels remained open - including the hotline between the two countries' Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO), a key link for military-to-military contact, as well as both high commissions. In 2019, as now, Pakistan said the attack was a \"false-flag operation\".\nMuch like this time a crackdown in Kashmir saw the arrest of over 80 \"overground workers\" - local supporters who may have provided logistical help, shelter, and intelligence to militants from the Pakistan-based group. Rajnath Singh, then Indian home minister, visited Jammu and Kashmir, and dossiers on the attack and suspected perpetrators were prepared.\nIn a meeting with the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Mr Bisaria told her that \"that India's diplomatic options in dealing with a terrorist attack of this nature was limited\".\n\"She gave me the impression that some tough action was round the corner, after which, I should expect the role of diplomacy to expand,\" Mr Bisaria writes. \nOn 26 February, Indian airstrikes - its first across the international border since 1971 - targeted JeM's training camp in Balakot.\nSix hours later, the Indian foreign secretary announced the strikes had killed \"a very large number\" of militants and commanders. Pakistan swiftly denied the claim. More high-level meetings followed in Delhi.\nThe crisis escalated dramatically the next morning, 27 February, when Pakistan launched retaliatory air raids.\nIn the ensuing dogfight, an Indian fighter jet was shot down, and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, ejected and landed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Captured by Pakistani forces, his detention in enemy territory triggered a wave of national concern and further heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.\nMr Bisaria writes India activated multiple diplomatic channels, with US and UK envoys pressing Islamabad. The Indian message was \"any attempt by Pakistan to escalate situation further or to cause harm to the pilot would lead to escalation by India.\"\nPakistani prime minister Imran Khan announced the pilot's release on 28 February, with the handover occurring on 1 March under prisoner of war protocol. Pakistan presented the move as a \"goodwill gesture\" aimed at de-escalating tensions.\nBy 5 March, with the dust settling from Pulwama, Balakot, and the pilot's return, India's political temperature had cooled. The Cabinet Committee on Security decided to send India's high commissioner back to Pakistan, signalling a shift towards diplomacy.\n\"I arrived in Islamabad on 10 March, 22 days after leaving in the wake of Pulwama. The most serious military exchange since Kargil had run its course in less than a month,\" Mr Bisaria writes,\n\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience.\"\nMr Bisaria described it as a \"testing and fascinating time\" to be a diplomat. This time, he notes, the key difference is that the targets were Indian civilians, and the attack occurred \"ironically, when the situation in Kashmir had dramatically improved\".\nHe views escalation as inevitable, but notes there's also a \"de-escalation instinct alongside the escalation instinct\". When the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meets during such conflicts, he says, their decisions weigh the conflict's economic impact and seek measures that hurt Pakistan without triggering a backlash against India.\n\"The body language and optics are similar [this time],\" he says, but highlights what he sees as the most significant move: India's threat to annul the Indus Waters Treaty. \"If India acts on this, it would have long-term, serious consequences for Pakistan.\"\n\"Remember, we're still in the middle of a crisis,\" says Mr Bisaria. \"We haven't yet seen any kinetic [military] action.\"",

In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.And before that, the horrific 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives.Each time, India has held Pakistan-based militant groups responsible for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.Since 2016, and especially after the 2019 airstrikes, the threshold for escalation has shifted dramatically. )Ajay BisariaAjay Bisaria (left) returned to Islamabad as India's high commissioner 22 days after the Pulwama attackIn his memoir, Mr Bisaria recounts India's response after the Pulwama attack on 14 February 2019.

It weighed heavily on his mind.\nThe 28-year-old German was beaten by American qualifier Learner Tien in the Acapulco second round, by 43rd-ranked Tallon Griekspoor in the Indian Wells second round, and by France's Arthur Fils in the Miami Open fourth round.\nLosing his opening match in Monte Carlo did irreparable damage, rendering his Munich title insignificant in his pursuit of Sinner.\nZverev believes the possibility of becoming world number one did not have an impact.\n\"I was just playing bad, to be honest,\" he said.\n\"Australia did affect me and there was a lot of things that, in my mind, I was not playing well.\"\nAlcaraz, already a four-time major champion before his 22nd birthday, had even further ground to make up.\nThe Spaniard started positively by winning the Rotterdam title, but a series of defeats in Doha, Indian Wells and - most damningly - Miami halted his momentum.\nIt meant Alcaraz was unable to regain top spot, even though he went on to win Monte Carlo and reach the Barcelona final last month.\nConstant talk of chasing Sinner had a negative influence on him.\n\"Since Jannik's ban started, a lot of people asked me about how important the moment was to reach number one again,\" said Alcaraz.\n\"I was thinking too much about it, instead of playing my good tennis and enjoying the time that I stepped on the court.\"\nInstead of another dominant player emerging, Sinner's absence produced a carousel of champions - including Britain's Jack Draper and Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, who both won their first Masters titles.\nIt means Sinner returns to an ATP Tour that has been blown wide open.\nWith Alcaraz injured and 37-year-old Novak Djokovic struggling, the current landscape appears to provide an opportunity for Sinner - who reached the French Open semi-finals last year - to hit the ground running.\nInside the doping deal for tennis' world number one\nSinner does not deserve any hate - Draper\nSinner is sure to receive a hero's welcome when he returns at the Italian Open.\nSupport from his compatriots has never wavered during the doping controversy, demonstrated by the 'Sinnermania' which swept the ATP Finals in Turin last year.\nThe man from the mountains in northern Italy enjoyed the greatest season of his career in 2024 - and one of the best in recent memory - so it is little wonder he is held in high esteem at home.\nThe reception might be frostier in the locker room, however.\nSinner has talked about how he felt \"uncomfortable\" around his peers at the Australian Open.\n\"It was a bit like some players looked at me differently and I didn't like it at all,\" he told Italian broadcaster RAI.\nThree-time major champion Stan Wawrinka was among many players who criticised  the way Sinner's case was handled, while plenty of others felt the timing of his ban was convenient.\nBritish number one Draper was one of a few players who did publicly back Sinner, reiterating his support in late April and saying the Italian \"doesn't deserve any hate\".\nWhile Sinner is not allowed to play competitively until Monday, he has been able to play some tennis.\nFrom the start of the ban until 13 April, he could practise at a private training base - as long as he did not come into contact with other professional players.\nSpeculation surfaced in March he had been hitting with Dominic Thiem - the recently retired 2020 US Open champion - after the pair were pictured having dinner together in Monte Carlo.\nHowever, Thiem laughed off the suggestion.\n\"I think for him and his level, I would not be [good] enough,\" Thiem told BBC Sport.\nUnder Wada rules, Sinner could start 'official training activity' from 13 April.\nSinner invited Draper - a friend he has played doubles with on the ATP Tour - to Monte Carlo for several days of practice sessions on the clay.\nAsked about Sinner's level, Draper told BBC Sport: \"He's very consistent, he's playing great.\n\"Maybe a little rusty in some areas, but with time he's improving every day. The more points we played, the more he was getting better.\n\"It was great to be around him for a few days and get some good sparring.\"\nSinner attended a Gucci event alongside Vogue editor Anna Wintour during Milan Fashion Week in February\nSinner was surrounded by his trusted team in Monaco - coaches Simone Vagnozzi and Darren Cahill, plus fitness trainer Marco Panichi, physio Ulises Badio and osteopath Andrea Cipolla.\nDraper said the trip was strictly business.\n\"I didn't speak to him too much to be honest,\" added the 23-year-old world number six, who lost to Sinner in last year's US Open semi-finals.\n\"On the court, Jannik is always very professional \u2013 he's number one for a reason.\n\"He seemed in good spirits, had a great team around him and great people who have supported him through a tough time.\"\nOnce Draper moved on to the Madrid Open, Sinner enlisted the help of Norwegian teenager Nicolai Budkov Kjaer in practice sessions.\nOff the court, Sinner has spent time with his family back in Italy and has pursued his other interests outside tennis.\nShortly after the announcement of his ban, he was pictured sitting alongside Vogue editor Anna Wintour at Milan Fashion Week.\nAccording to a source close to Sinner, the player has been enjoying skiing, biking and go-karting between tennis sessions in recent weeks.\n\"I think he is feeling refreshed \u2013 tennis is very relentless. I'm sure he will come back to Rome and the rest of the year in fine form,\" said Draper.\nLive scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

She was studying it, and then said 'it's OK dad, I don't think they can see me crying'.\n\"That's all she was worried about.\"\nRory McIlroy beat Justin Rose in a dramatic play-off to win the Masters in April\nFor years, McIlroy had faced questions over whether he could complete the career Grand Slam.\nThere had been missed opportunities to claim the iconic green jacket - most notably after an infamous final-round collapse in 2011. \nDespite his talent and self belief, the 35-year-old admitted to wondering if he had missed his opportunity.\n\"You start to think if it is ever going to be your time,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a good message in there about never giving up and keep coming back. \n\"Be strong, be resilient and that patience paid off.\"\nThe Northern Irishman held a two-shot lead going into the final round, and said he had learnt lessons from his 2011 collapse, when he let a four-stroke advantage slip away.\n\"I wanted to make everything else irrelevant. I'm not going to look at what my playing partner is doing, I'm not going to look at the leaderboard. \n\"I was going to try and get in my own world.

        "article_text": "Israel says its fighter jets bombed an area next to the presidential palace in Syria's capital Damascus on Friday morning, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to protect the Druze religious minority following days of deadly sectarian violence.\nNetanyahu said the strike was a \"clear message to the Syrian regime\" that Israel would \"not allow the deployment of forces south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community\".\nLater on Friday, the Israeli military confirmed it had launched another wave of air strikes, attacking military targets. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, reported nearly 20, with Syrian state media saying one person had been killed. \nThe Syrian presidency has said it strongly condemns the strikes, calling them a \"dangerous escalation\" intended to destabilise Syria.\nIsrael also carried out strikes south of Damascus on Wednesday during clashes between Druze gunmen, security forces and allied Sunni Islamist fighters.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticised the recent Israeli bombing, calling it a \"violation of Syria's sovereignty\".\nIn a statement delivered by his spokesman, Guterres called for Israel to stop such attacks and to respect Syria's \"unity, its territorial integrity and its independence\".\nA spiritual leader of Syria's Druze, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, condemned the violence on Thursday as an \"unjustifiable genocidal campaign\" against his community and called for intervention by \"international forces to maintain peace\".\nOther Druze religious leaders put out a statement early on Friday confirming what they said was the community's \"commitment to a country that includes all Syrians, a nation that is free of strife\", according to the Associated Press.\nThey also reportedly said the state should be activated in Suweida province, and that authorities should be in control of the Suweida-Damascus highway.\nThe Syrian government said it had deployed security forces to Druze areas to combat \"outlaw groups\" which it accused of instigating the clashes.\nAccording to SOHR, at least 109 people have been killed this week in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya, a town in the southern outskirts of Damascus, the mainly Druze suburb of Jaramana, and the southern province of Suweida, which has a Druze majority.\nIt says that includes 11 Druze civilians and 26 Druze fighters, as well as another 42 Druze men who were shot dead in an \"ambush\" by security forces while travelling from Suweida to Damascus on Wednesday. Thirty members of the General Security service and allied fighters have also been killed, it says.\nIstanbul-based Syria TV reported that the Israeli air strike near the presidential palace appeared to have targeted an empty area, and that there were no reports of casualties or material damage.\nIsrael's Defence Minister issued a statement saying that when the Syrian president woke up and saw the results he would \"understand well that Israel is determined to prevent harm to the Druze in Syria\".\n\"It is [Sharaa's] duty to protect the Druze in the suburbs of Damascus from jihadist assailants and to allow the hundreds of thousands of Druze in Suweida and Jabal al-Druze to defend themselves on their own, rather than sending jihadist forces into their communities,\" he added.\nIn a statement released on Friday afternoon, the Syrian presidency said it \"condemned in the strongest terms the bombing of the presidential palace yesterday by the Israeli occupation, which constitutes a dangerous escalation against state institutions and the sovereignty of the state\".\n\"This reprehensible attack reflects the continuation of reckless movements that seek to destabilize the country and exacerbate security crises,\" it added.\nThe presidency also called on the international community to stand by Syria in confronting the attacks, which it said violated international law.\nA Druze religious leader in Suweida, Sheikh Hamoud al-Hinawi, meanwhile told the BBC that the situation was \"still tense\" in the affected areas.\n\"What is happening right now is sectarian targeting by extremist elements [and] it is the duty of the state to protect civilians,\" he said.\n\"We support the rule of law and national sovereignty of Syria, as long as the national government is protecting its citizens and adhering to its commitment to rebuilding a modern Syria.\"\nWhen asked whether he supported the Israeli intervention, Sheikh Hinawi said: \"It's not a matter of whether I am for or against Israel - it is a matter of life and death for us and if we are being attacked we have every right to defend ourselves.\"\nOn Thursday, a member of the security forces deployed in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya told the BBC that they were \"not targeting any sect, but rather dealing with an armed group acting outside the law, regardless of its religious affiliation\", adding: \"Any such group will be held accountable.\"\nThe sectarian violence erupted in Jaramana on Monday night after an audio clip of a man insulting the Prophet Muhammad circulated on social media and angered Sunni Muslims. It was attributed to a Druze cleric, but he denied any responsibility. The interior ministry also said a preliminary inquiry had cleared him.\nThe Druze faith is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs. Half its roughly one million followers live in Syria, where they make up about 3% of the population, while there are smaller communities in Lebanon, Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.\nSyria's transitional President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has promised to protect the country's many religious and ethnic minorities since his Sunni Islamist group led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad's regime in December after 13 years of devastating civil war.\nHowever, the mass killings of hundreds of civilians from Assad's minority Alawite sect in the western coastal region in March, during clashes between the new security forces and Assad loyalists, hardened fears among minority communities.\nIn February, Israel's prime minister warned that he would not \"tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria\" from the country's new security forces.\nNetanyahu also demanded the complete demilitarisation of Suweida and two other southern provinces, saying Israel saw Sharaa's Sunni Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), as a threat. HTS is a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK.\nThe Israeli military has already carried out hundreds of strikes across Syria to destroy the country's military assets over the past four months. It has also sent troops into the UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Syria, as well as several adjoining areas and the summit of Mount Hermon.",

It was to talk about safety and the racing. I find myself talking about things I don't have any intention of talking about and we are here to talk about going racing, the fastest cars, the safest cars, the best engineering, and yet we talk about fines and punishments and swearing.\n\"Maybe something should change.

We want to be able to work closely with the FIA. We all want to work together and make the sport better.\n\"We have faced a bit of an uphill challenge in that communication over time.\n\"We don't hold a power seat at the table and that needs to change, in my opinion.

        "article_text": "For just two weeks each spring, a rare violet artichoke is harvested by hand on Venice's northern islands \u2013 and locals go to great lengths to keep it authentic.\nThe water glitters in the sunlight as Venetian farmer Guia da Camerino steers her boat past the briccole, the wooden piles that mark invisible \u2013 to non-Venetians \u2013 lanes through the lagoon. Just a few kilometres north of Venice's warren of tourist-packed streets are the islands of Sant'Erasmo and Le Vignole, known as \"the vegetable garden of Venice\" for their lush, fertile ground \u2013 and for a rare flower that grows for only 10 days a year.\nDa Camerino is one of just four farmers on the island of Le Vignole, and she specialises in the carciofo violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a Venetian type of artichoke plant that produces a local delicacy known as a castra\u00f9ra. The castra\u00f9re are the plant's first buds: small, tight and conical artichokes that are \"castrated\" off the plant \u2013 giving them their name \u2013 in order to allow the botoli, larger buds (and the kind you'd probably find on your plate the rest of the year), to grow in their place.\nSpring is a busy time of year for da Camerino as the violet artichokes come into bloom and must be harvested during a short window of about two weeks, with each plant only producing one castra\u00f9ra a year. The tiny artichokes, half the size of a human palm, are highly prized, both for their rarity and their unique, saline taste.\n\"It's hard to describe the taste if you've never had it before,\" she explains, as we walk through her artichoke fields, the belltowers of Venice visible on the horizon. \"It's initially bitter but transforms into sweetness in the mouth. It's very versatile and easy to eat \u2013 not like a Roman artichoke that you have to peel and prepare laboriously. The castra\u00f9re are so tender that you can eat them raw.\"\nThe castra\u00f9re's rarity means that for years Venetian farmers have had to deal with counterfeit versions coming from elsewhere in Italy. The violet artichoke doesn't just grow in the Veneto \u2013 this species of plant is also grown in Tuscany, Sardinia and Sicily. But any Venetian will tell you that a true Sant'Erasmo artichoke tastes nothing like its terraferma counterparts. That's because the islands are positioned at the lagoon's opening to the Adriatic, which makes the soil distinctively salty \u2013 a salinity that is tempered by rainwater. There's even a festival dedicated to the artichoke (usually on the second Sunday in May) when people travel from all over the lagoon to Sant'Erasmo to eat artichoke dishes, drink artichoke-based spritzes or digestifs and buy entire pallets of the vegetable to take home before the season ends.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nIt's not easy to coax the flower out of the plant. Everything is done by hand, with no pesticides, and in Venice there's the ever-present danger of an acqua alta (seasonal flooding) that could drown the fields. An artichoke is a perennial plant that has to be cut back every summer in order to grow imperceptibly during the winter months. Now climate change is causing the season to arrive earlier and earlier.\n\"It's very worrying,\" says da Camerino. \"The plant needs nine months to slowly grow. Traditionally, the castra\u00f9re were harvested on 25 April, Saint Mark's Day. But we harvested our first castra\u00f9ra at the beginning of April this year. It's getting hotter earlier and earlier, and the plants won't have time to grow. Eventually, the castra\u00f9re could disappear.\"\nBecause they're so delicate, the castra\u00f9re don't get exported far out of the lagoon and are usually harvested, sold and eaten in the same day. Da Camerino sells directly to restaurants in Venice that \"understand the quality\" of the product. The problem, she says, is that many restaurants in Venice have stopped buying real castra\u00f9re \"because they're expensive and non-local customers can't tell the difference. So they use normal artichokes but pretend they're castra\u00f9re so they can hike up the prices.\"\nHow to try castra\u00f9re\n\u2022 Plan a trip to Venice around mid-April to hit the height of the castra\u00f9re season.\n\u2022 Always ring ahead to see if restaurants are serving them, since it's so dependent on the harvest.\n\u2022 If you want to try preparing them at home, make sure you only buy artichokes with the consorzio's label \u2013 and don't be afraid to grill the seller about where they come from.\n\u2022 If you miss the season, don't worry; you can buy a jar of violet artichokes preserved in oil from Finotello's farm on Sant'Erasmo.\n\u2022 You can also get them in liquid form: the amaro digestif Venesian is made from Sant'Erasmo artichokes. Pick up a bottle to take home at the delicatessen Maramao, which sells local products from its canalside shop in the Cannaregio district.\nAl Covino, a Venice restaurant that focuses on local produce and traditional ingredients recognised by Italy's Slow Food presidium, makes a point of serving the castra\u00f9re when they come into season. It's a cosy space with pistachio-green roof beams, hanging plants and only 15 covers, hidden on a small street in the city's Castello neighbourhood and run by husband-and-wife team Claudio De Lauzieres and Claudia Torcellan. De Lauzieres, a Neopolitan who has been living in Venice for 12 years,\u00a0rhapsodises about the local ingredients with a boyish enthusiasm: \"Neapolitan cuisine is much more well-known than Venetian cuisine, but the lagoon offers so many different environments and unique tastes. The castra\u00f9re symbolise the richness of the land here.\"\nHe prepares three castra\u00f9re dishes: a silky, gently saut\u00e9ed version that doesn't just melt on the tongue but entirely disappears, leaving a subtly sweet aftertaste; tagliolini in a velvety artichoke sauce; and raw shavings of the vegetable in a salad with oil, parmesan and a hint of lemon zest. He watches my face as I take a bite of the salad and grins at my expression of surprise at the tiny bud's powerful taste. Its flavour instantly takes me back to da Camerino's boat and the smell of the salty lagoon air whipping past my face.\nOn Sant'Erasmo, local farmer Carlo Finotello has been working for years to crack down on the falsely labelled castra\u00f9re that appear in markets and shops across the lagoon. He runs the farm I Sapori di Sant'Erasmo with his brother Claudio and is also the president of the Consorzio del Carciofo Violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a consortium created in 2004 to promote the local violet artichoke. Its label is a mark of quality and authenticity.\n\"Some vegetable sellers take the consorzio label and stick it on other crates of normal artichokes,\" Finotello explained. \"Or they will buy some castra\u00f9re but then mix them in with normal artichokes so they're still making a bit extra.\"\nWhen the consortium receives a tip-off about producers passing off Tuscan artichokes as the Sant'Erasmo version, Finotello contacts them directly to ask them to desist \u2013 but the consortium isn't a policeman, he says, and they have no power to issue fines, nor the time or money to take them to court. He says that it's vital to only buy castra\u00f9re from a local producer, and to always make sure that they have the consortium's label, in order to protect the centuries-old tradition of growing them.\nMore like this:\n \u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n \u2022\u00a0The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'\n \u2022\u00a0Where to savour Rome's hidden Jewish food\nI visit Finotello at his farm to see him harvest the castra\u00f9re. It's a muggy day with a hot, salty breeze, and the earth is springy after days of rain. The artichoke plants are slowly opening up in the sun. Finotello shows me how to cut a castra\u00f9ra gently off the stalk with the traditional curved knife, which he holsters in the pocket of his overalls between rows. The plants used to be fertilised with scoasse (garbage in Venetian dialect), a mix of fish bones and old crab shells. \"We can't do that anymore because there's too much plastic in the food system,\" Finotello tells me, shrugging. \"We'd just be feeding the plants plastic.\"\nWhen he finishes harvesting the small field, he counts how many castra\u00f9re he picked: 105. He then dumps the basket in the back of his trailer and looks at me, grinning. \"Now you need to eat some.\"\nAt the farmhouse, his mother, Mirella Bubacco, is holding court in a kitchen busy with the detritus of the recent Italian Easter celebration: chocolate eggs and endless cups of espresso next to slices of colomba, a type of Italian Easter cake. Mirella is warm, businesslike \u2013 and very chatty.\n\"Don't ever eat it as an antipasto!\" she warns me, a paring knife in one hand. \"The taste lingers in your mouth, and it'll alter the taste of your first course.\" She insists that it is best eaten in the very simple Venetian style: uncooked, julienned, with a ribbon of light-tasting olive oil, a bit of salt and shavings of Grana Padano. \"The earth here on Sant'Erasmo is all the condiment you need!\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \n\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. \n",

        "article_text": "Grip strength is associated with a range of health outcomes, from type 2 diabetes to depression. Here\u2019s how to check yours.\nIn a world of technologically-driven longevity clinics with their increasingly sophisticated imaging scans, some of which can cost tens of thousands of dollars, it turns out that one of the best assessments of muscle strength and quality is to simply sit in a chair and squeeze a tennis ball.\u00a0\nThat's the recommendation offered by Joshua Davidson, a strength and conditioning researcher at the University of Derby who studies hand grip strength, a metric increasingly recognised as one of the most reliable markers of human health.\nWhen testing grip strength in clinical trials, scientists typically use a hand dynamometer, a device which you squeeze as hard as possible to measure the force generated by the muscles in your hand and forearm. Several companies are now attempting to take the dynamometer out of the clinic and into the home, combining easy-to-use devices with mobile apps to let anyone chart their grip strength over time.\nHowever, according to Davidson, you can still get a decent idea through a simple \"squeeze test\" with a tennis or stress ball. \"All you need is any object that you can grasp and can be deformed without causing pain or discomfort,\" he says. \"Simply squeeze it for as long as you can before your grip fatigues. Being able to maintain a maximal squeeze on something like a tennis ball for 15-30 seconds would be a good standard to strive for.\" Noting down how long you can squeeze can help you track your grip strength over time.\u00a0\nOf course, as Mark Peterson, a physical medicine and rehabilitation professor at the University of Michigan points out, having a weak grip strength alone will have relatively little impact on your everyday life directly, beyond making it a little bit harder to open cans or jars. But researchers are increasingly using grip strength as a proxy for overall musculoskeletal strength throughout the body. It can reflect whether a person is active enough or too sedentary and indicate their risk of frailty \u2013 the condition of being vulnerable as a result of a decline in one's physiological health.\nThis first came to scientists' attention through a particularly notable study of nearly 140,000 adults across high, middle and low-income countries which found grip strength was a better predictor for premature death than other more obvious indicators such as blood pressure.\nOther research has revealed that a person's grip strength can indicate their likelihood of living past 100. In one study, volunteers had their grip strengths measured in 1965-1968, when they were between 56 and 68 years old, and their survival was tracked for the next 44 years. Those who became centenarians were 2.5 times more likely to have had grip strength results in the highest third, compared to those who died before the age of 79.\u00a0\u00a0\nDarryl Leong, an associate professor of medicine at McMaster University in Canada, explains that your handgrip strength \u2013 and therefore your overall muscular strength \u2013 is a sum of your nutrition, physical activity and whether you have any illnesses. \"This is the reason it's associated with so many health outcomes,\" he says.\nOne study which used dynamometer testing found that grip strength scores of less than 25.5 kilograms for men and 18 kilograms for women suggests a heightened risk of sarcopenia throughout the body, the progressive loss of muscle mass and function which is linked to decreased strength and mobility in later life, and a greater likelihood of falling and developing fractures.\nGuillaume Par\u00e9, a practising physician and a professor of medicine at McMaster University, says that it's possible to tell a lot even from a simple handshake, with grip strength serving as a marker for whether someone is likely to have sarcopenia. \"Weaker handshakes where fingers struggle to close completely around my hand, or where hand muscles are emaciated, are red flags,\" he says.\nBut the links between grip strength and longevity go well beyond physical capabilities. Studies have shown that muscle is a key player in the metabolic system, acting as a reservoir which can soak up excess blood glucose and help prevent the development of insulin resistance. Because of this, a weaker grip can indicate that a person is more prone to a plethora of problems linked to metabolic dysfunction, ranging from type 2 diabetes to lower bone mineral density, malnutrition, cognitive impairment and depression.\nIf you do have a dynamometer to hand, you can use the chart above to compare your grip strength against. The results were taken from a study on the average grip strength measurements for healthy people in each sex across different age groups.\nBack in 2022, Peterson led a study which assessed the grip strength of 1,275 men and women and compared these results to an analysis of their DNA. The team found that those with lower grip strength scores showed signs of accelerated ageing. Specifically, they had differences in their DNA methylation patterns \u2013 tags associated with our DNA which can alter the way it is read over our lifetimes. Methylation patterns often change in response to environmental or lifestyle factors, such as obesity, pollution or even social stress, among many other things.\nWrist curls: Improve your grip strength\nBegin by sitting with your arms on your lap. Grip a can in your hand, with your palm facing upwards. Then slowly bring the can upwards towards your body, without moving your arm. Hold it there for a second, and carefully lower it back down. With practise, aim to build up to doing five sets of 20 repetitions.\nFor Par\u00e9 this is unsurprising, as he says he sees grip strength as a key marker of both disease resilience and likelihood of recovering from chronic illnesses. For example, research in cancer patients shows that those with poorer grip strength are more likely to experience sudden weight loss or cachexia \u2013 extreme muscle or fat loss, despite eating normally \u2013 and thus worse prognosis and survival outcomes.\n\"It means that once we have a disease, our ability to fight it is limited,\" says Peterson. \"For example, the risk of dying from a pneumonia is much increased in individuals with lower grip strength, which makes sense considering the importance of good muscular health to properly clear the airways of sputum [the saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract as a result of infections].\"\nGrip strength isn't just something to be aware of in later life, either. Researchers have even found that the average grip strength of a population tends to correlate with how many medals a country is likely to win at the Olympic Games. Meanwhile, Par\u00e9 says that teenagers and young adults who have poorer grip strength are likely to be more prone to health issues at an earlier age. One study in Brazil showed that teenagers who spent more time on their screens, either on their phones or other devices, tended to have worse grip strength.\n\"There's data supporting the association of low grip strength with poor metabolic health even in young adults,\" says Par\u00e9.\nSo, can we improve our grip strength? Certainly, says Davidson, and it's something which you can work on irrespective of your age. He suggests simply using the tennis ball test to progressively work the muscles of your hand and forehand to contract at maximal power for as long as you can. With practise, you should see steady improvements over time, he says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Sit-to-stand: The simple test that reveals how you're ageing\n\u2022 The ruler drop test: Check your reaction times\n\u2022 What your fingernails can reveal about your health\u00a0\nIt also isn't just about grip. Leong recommends working on being more physically active in general and training the muscles in your lower and upper body. If you do this, he says your grip strength will improve accordingly.\u00a0\nFor older adults, Leong suggests trying the timed get-up-and-go test. \"Here, the individual records with a stopwatch, the time taken to rise from a chair, walk three metres, turn around and return to the seated position,\" says Leong. \"This is a test of lower limb strength and mobility and will help improve your total muscle strength.\"\nDavidson says that general resistance exercises to improve muscle mass and maintain bone mineral density will lead to improvements in grip strength. \"We all need to engage in regular physical activity as we age,\" he says. \"You can work out at home either using specialist equipment or just things you have around the house. Two to three sets of single arm wrist curls, with reps of between 10 and 20, is a good exercise to start with. If you have a kettlebell at home, bicep curls are also good exercises to try.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

So in the context of that, and his own weekend, second was not too bad.\n\"I'm very happy with the end result,\" Norris said. \"Just a shame when you miss out on pole, so that's the only frustrating bit.\n\"But I've been trying different things, I've been doing different things with the team to try and work a bit more in this area and things have been taking a step forward. So I'm happy. Maybe not quite there yet, but happy with the progress.\"\nVerstappen beats Norris to Miami pole\nNorris wins Miami sprint with help from safety car\nHis team-mate Oscar Piastri, too, felt he should have been in the fight for pole with Verstappen.\nBut the Australian, leading the championship by nine points after his third victory of the season in Saudi Arabia last time out, said he was fourth because of \"poor execution\".\nPiastri added: \"The gap has always been close, and our advantage has been a little more on Sundays, but our picture of where we stand is that if we make mistakes we are going to be beaten and that's been true through the year.\"\nTeam principal Andrea Stella says McLaren have now seen enough of a pattern to work out what has been happening to allow Verstappen to take three poles in six races.\n\"We have now enough statistics to confirm what was already our initial impression in Bahrain during the (pre-season) test,\" Stella said, \"that the car was easier to exploit in terms of performance in race simulation runs, rather than on a single lap with qualifying trim and new tyres.\n\"We have seen that pretty much so far we haven't had any perfect lap.\n\"We are definitely trying to assess on a solid engineering basis our understanding so that we can make some adjustments that our drivers can test to see if we can give them a car that is just slightly more predictable and rich of information in terms of how the grip is when driving the car at the limit.\"\nHe added: \"Just to make sure that my point is clear, it's a car that doesn't give you much 'cueing', which is the technical word we use, and this means that it's not easy for our drivers to repeat some big performances that we can see in individual laps.\"\nUpgrades are coming to try to solve this, and Red Bull have their own in Miami, a new floor that is the first of a number of developments they hope will allow Verstappen to challenge the McLaren drivers more consistently in races.\n\"What we are trying to achieve of course is a better balance in the car,\" Verstappen said. \"Now this track is not always the easiest to say that you have improved or nailed something because it's just a really weird layout I would say. So it takes a bit more time.\n\"But for sure it was not negative. And yeah, from here we can work and try to improve it further because from my feeling, of course, we're not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight.\"\nNorris beat team-mate Oscar Piastri to victory in the sprint race, narrowing the gap between them in the drivers' championship by one point\nIn McLaren's view, Red Bull have not been painting the most accurate picture of the competitive picture between the two teams.\n\"Red Bull, they are very good at making fast cars,\" Stella said. \"They are very exceptionally good, I would say, at driving fast cars, and they are extremely good also in creating the narrative to their advantage.\n\"They exploit every possible opportunity to stay in the competition, and some of these opportunities sometimes is to create the narrative, like, 'oh, we are making miracles here, the others should win every single practice session and qualifying and race.'\n\"This is the narrative created by some of our competitors, which we read occasionally and then we change the page and we focus on ourselves.\"\nThe grid sets up an intriguing race. The title contenders are in reverse order, with an interloper between Norris and Piastri in the form of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\nAnd Norris scents an opportunity to nail his first victory since the opening race of the season in Australia back in March.\nIn qualifying, he made errors at the last corner on both his laps, each time costing about 0.2secs, so he knows the pace is in the car.\n\"Max has always been good in qualifying and as a team we have struggled a little more in qualifying, whether that's set-up or what, I'm not too sure,\" Norris said.\n\"We know the Red Bulls are running high downforce, which allows them especially with the DRS (in qualifying) to be a lot more competitive. But it's a long race and we know we have good pace in both conditions.\n\"I don't just expect competition from Max. Kimi's been quick all weekend and Oscar has been as well.

        "article_text": "Businesses are bracing for possible impact after neighbours India and Bangladesh  recently imposed tit-for-tat trade restrictions after months of verbal sparring.\nLast month, Bangladesh restricted land imports of cotton yarn from India to shield local industries from cheaper imports. \nDhaka's move came days after India abruptly stopped the transhipment facility it had offered Bangladesh to export its cargoes to third countries via its ports and airports, citing \"congestion\".\nRelations between the countries have soured since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August after massive protests. She is currently in exile in India and an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is in charge.\nSince then Dhaka has demanded Hasina be extradited to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her, and Delhi has not officially reacted to the demand.\nIndia has also frequently criticised reports of attacks on the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh. It recently said the alleged killing of a Hindu community leader \"reflects a pattern of systematic persecution under the interim government\".\nBangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation, denies targeting minorities, calling most incidents politically motivated or ordinary crimes. Hindus make up less than 10% of its 170 million population.\nAs the countries spar, firms are counting the cost.\nYarn, vital for Bangladesh's clothing factories, can still enter by sea and air - but they are slower and costlier routes.\nIn 2024, India had exported $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn) worth of cotton yarn to Bangladesh, a third of it via land ports.\nThe now-halted transhipment facility let Bangladeshi exporters send clothes made for high-end brands by road to Indian cities, from where it would be flown to Europe and the US.\n\"It's a blow [to Bangladesh's fast-fashion export industry],\" says Anis Ahmed, head of supply chain firm MGH Group, which ships for European fast-fashion brands. \"The India route got cargo to Western countries in a week. By sea, it takes up to eight weeks.\"\nBangladesh, the world's second-largest garment exporter after China, shipped $38bn in clothing last year. Over $1bn of this moved via the India land-air route, which Ahmed says was thriving.\nLimited air freight capacity and under-equipped airports hamper direct exports from Bangladesh.\nMany see Delhi's withdrawal of the transhipment facility as a response to remarks by Yunus during a recent China visit.\nHe had called Bangladesh the \"only guardian of the ocean\" for India's landlocked north-east and suggested that the region could become an \"extension of the Chinese economy.\"\nLeaders from India's north-eastern states called the comments \"offensive\".\nYunus's remarks, spotlighting India's strategic vulnerability in the region to China, raised alarms in Delhi.\nIndia's north-east is linked to the mainland by the 20km-wide Siliguri Corridor - dubbed the \"chicken's neck\" - flanked by Nepal and Bangladesh and close to Tibet's Chumbi Valley.\nWith a history of border tensions and having lost a war in 1962, Indian defence planners fear that China could target the corridor to cut off the north-eastern states from the rest of the country in any future conflict.\nBangladeshi analysts say Yunus's remarks were misinterpreted and aimed at promoting regional connectivity.\nDuring his China visit, Dhaka also welcomed Beijing's interest in a $1bn Teesta River project in northern Bangladesh.\nIndian analysts warn that Chinese involvement in the project, which is not far from the strategic Siliguri Corridor, could unsettle Delhi.\nBut there is concern on both sides over the frosty ties.\nResentment is growing in Bangladesh over tightened Indian visa rules, with approvals plunging since Hasina was driven from power. Previously, two million Bangladeshis visited India yearly for tourism, business, education and medical care. The number of visas issued daily has dropped by over 80% in the past few months according to local media.\nHasina's stay in India and the extradition demand remains a big irritant.\n\"They should realise that there is no way that we can just hand Hasina to them. We know what will happen to her if she's handed over. I think public opinion in India would not countenance that,\" says Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary.\nAmid rising tensions, India's clothing manufacturers' association has called for a ban on Bangladeshi garment imports via land. Bangladeshi analysts warn that more trade barriers would be counter-productive.\n\"I think there is a strong view nowadays in Bangladesh that we should also reassess the other transit and transhipment facilities given to India [for its north-eastern states] by the earlier [Hasina] government,\" Debapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka, tells the BBC.\nIndia uses Bangladeshi ports, roads and waterways to transport goods to its landlocked north-east, cutting distance, time and costs. However, officials say transit volumes haven't reached expected levels.\nDelhi-Dhaka tensions are rising amid growing ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan.\nBangladesh, once East Pakistan, fought for independence in 1971 with Indian support. Hasina distanced herself from Pakistan during her 15-year rule.\nPakistan's Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch visited Dhaka last month, the first such visit in 15 years. A planned visit by Pakistan Deputy PM Ishaq Dar was postponed due to tensions between Delhi and Islamabad over the deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir last week.\n\"I don't think there is any concern over Dhaka's reachout to Pakistan. If there is any suggestion that there is an intent to work together and make things difficult for India, then that will obviously cause concern,\" says Saran, the former Indian diplomat.\nSharp official reactions from both sides are also influencing public opinion in India and Bangladesh. There is a growing anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh, with Indian media accused of exaggerating the attacks on minorities and Islamist threats.\nThe people-to-people ties built over years seem to be on the retreat, and analysts point out that if both sides fail to stay calm, their actions could harm trade and economic relations.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Trying to find the limit. I had a tiny moment into Turn One trying to find more time there but it's very tricky here with the tyres. It's qualifying, try to correct it and floor it out of the corner.\"\nIt was a second piece of good news for the four-time champion this week, after the birth of his first child, a daughter called Lily.\nNorris said: \"Congrats to Max, especially being a dad now. I was hoping it would slow him down a bit but it clearly didn't.\n\"Max did a Max lap again and I'm happy for him. The pace is there. I have been feeling good. It is what it is, I'm P2, Max on pole, ready to see what I can do into Turn One.\"\nAntonelli's third place proved his pole in the sprint on Friday was not a flash in the pan, on a weekend where he is showing the spark of prodigious talent that convinced Mercedes to put the 18-year-old straight into their team in his debut season. He beat team-mate George Russell by 0.114secs.\nIt also made amends to some degree for a disappointing sprint result, where he lost the lead at the start and then was hit by Verstappen's car in the pits and finished seventh.\n\"This weekend is going well so far,\" he said. \"It was a bit disappointing this morning, but happy to bounce back. I was a bit too greedy into Turn One but the rest of the lap was quite good.

'He just came to survive' \u2013 Alvarez frustrated in points winImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, WBA, WBC, WBO and IBF champion Alvarez becomes the fourth male boxer to become a two-time undisputed champion in the four-belt era, joining Crawford, Oleksandr Usyk and Naoya Inoue.Fighting outside of Mexico or America for the first time as a professional, Alvarez made his ring walk at the unusually early 06:20 local time to cater for audiences back home.As he often does, Alvarez started slowly to feel out his opponent. \"He came just to survive until the 12th round,\" Alvarez said after his 63rd career win. \"Crawford is one of the best out there and I like to share with that kind of fighter,\" Alvarez said.Crawford is the reigning WBA light-middleweight champion and has won all 41 pro bouts but is likely to be a slight underdog because of his weight disadvantage.He described the blockbuster against Alvarez as the \"biggest fight of the past decade\".While it has the potential to break box office and gate receipt records, some boxing purists feel Alvarez has ducked the hard-hitting David Benavidez, an unbeaten American fighter with Mexican heritage who has 24 stoppages in 30 wins and is nicknamed 'The Mexican Monster'.Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published1 day agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished31 January \"Canelo & Crawford set for 'biggest fight of past decade'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Boxing powerhouse Turki Alalshikh announced the Alvarez-Crawford super-fight Alvarez was stripped of the IBF belt instead of facing Scull last year but once again becomes the king of the super-middleweight division.He said it would be a \"pleasure\" to defend all four recognised world titles against Crawford.",

The Saints again held firm against the maul but after illegal defence, Leinster were able to score through Caelan Doris off a tap penalty. \nThe Leinster and Ireland skipper followed his try with a 50:22 of his own soon after but again his side could not execute the line-out maul. \nSmith's second penalty pushed his side out to an eight-point lead but, with 20 minutes remaining, replacement Ryan Baird won the penalty and line-out that preceded Van der Flier's second score. \nAgain, though, the Saints produced a stout response. Only two minutes later, full-back James Ramm picked a brilliant line and was over in the corner.\nThe Saints' efforts to see out the victory were hampered when blind-side flanker Josh Kemeny was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle on Rabah Slimani. \nWith 10 minutes to go, James Lowe halved the deficit as Leinster scored their second of the day from a well-worked tap penalty and Prendergast added the extras to bring his side within three. \nThe Saints again relied upon their stout maul defence but, as the clock showed 79 minutes, Leinster were awarded a penalty with Alex Coles sent to the sin-bin just as time expired on Kemeny's yellow.\nLeinster again went for the tap but the 14 men of Northampton turned them over on the line to complete a famous win. \nLeinster: Keenan; O'Brien, Ringrose, Henshaw, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Healy, Sheehan, Furlong, Snyman, McCarthy, Deegan, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\nReplacements: Kelleher, Porter, Slimani, Baird, Conan, McGrath, R Byrne, Barrett.\nNorthampton Saints: Ramm; Freeman, Dingwall (capt), Hutchinson, Litchfield; Smith, Mitchell; Iyogun, Langdon, Davison, Mayanavanua, Coles, Kemeny, Pollock, Augustus.\nReplacements: Walker, West, Millar Mills, Lockett, Munga, Scott-Young, James, Seabrook.\nYellow cards: Langdon, Kemeny, Coles\nReferee: Pierre Brousset (France)",

        "article_text": "While most 13-year-olds were spending their Monday evening stressing over homework, awkward school crushes and what to post on TikTok, Blue Ivy Carter was performing in front of a crowd of 70,000 people alongside her mother Beyonc\u00e9 on the opening night of her Cowboy Carter tour.\nHer numerous cameos throughout the show \u2013 particularly her solo dance during D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \u2013 were highly praised.\n\"She must be one of the most self-disciplined 13-year-olds in America,\" Variety's Chris Willman wrote. On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the \"greatest nepo baby of all time\" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.\nBeing a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.\nThe teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right?\nThis is also not the first time Blue Ivy has performed in public \u2013 she joined her mother on stage two years ago on the Renaissance tour and last year voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King.\nBut music journalist Caroline Sullivan says Blue Ivy's trajectory to stardom \"has very little to do with her and everything to do with the parent\".\n\"It's about how much we like or dislike the parent \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is well liked so fans will praise Blue Ivy,\" she explains. \"Of course, it helps that she's good at what she does but even if she wasn't, she'd be given an easier ride.\"\nSullivan also says that the authenticity of Blue Ivy wanting to perform instead of being forced to do it by her mother adds to how we perceive her.\nSpeaking to the BBC last month, Beyonc\u00e9's mother, Tina Knowles, said Blue Ivy and her siblings were being nurtured to do \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed into show business\".\nShe added that her granddaughter had had to \"work for\" her role in The Lion King prequel and she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.\nBlue Ivy is hardly the first child to have performed on stage with a famous parent. Madonna's 17-year-old daughter played the piano on her mother's Celebration tour in 2023, Dave Grohl's 19-year-old daughter has often sung with him on stage and Phil Collins' son was the drummer on his 2019 tour.\n\"It's not because he's the boss's son that he's playing the drums, it's because he's good enough,\" the former Genesis drummer said in 2019 as he defended his decision to take his 17-year-old son on his world tour.\nSullivan says it can often be \"naff and cringy\" if a musician brings their child on stage \"just for the sake of it\", but if done right, it can be \"incredibly sweet and show a lot of love\".\nMany critics, including Tomas Mier from Rolling Stone, said Beyonc\u00e9's youngest daughter Rumi joining her on stage for Protector was \"one of the most heartwarming moments of the evening\".\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West's 11-year-old daughter, North West, has also forged the beginnings of a music career, recently delivering a rap verse in Japanese on FKA Twigs' single Childlike Things.\nTwigs said she chose to collaborate with North West because her \"energy is so inspiring\" and she was \"so confident\".\n\"I wasn't that confident when I was a kid. I was so shy, I was scared of the dark, I was very different to the other kids at my school. It suddenly occurred to me that I would have loved to have a friend like North, who could speak up for themselves.\"\nNorth West also appeared as Young Simba in the Hollywood Bowl's The Lion King 30th anniversary concert last year but her singing was criticised on social media.\n\"Given how controversial her parents are, I think North West will struggle to break away from the nepo baby claims because unless she is unbelievably talented, she will be slated,\" Sullivan says.\nIn December 2022, New York magazine's cover story on nepo babies caused a stir in the showbusiness industry.\nThe cover featured the faces of famous actors including Dakota Johnson, Jack Quaid, Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Lily Rose-Depp edited onto the bodies of babies, with the headline: \"She has her mother's eyes. And agent.\"\nThe story claimed that \"a nepo baby is physical proof that meritocracy is a lie\" and that \"today, they're not only abundant - they're thriving\".\nIt was met with backlash by many stars who claimed the label was unfair and diminished their hard work.\nGwyneth Paltrow, a nepo baby herself as the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and film director Bruce Paltrow, said the term was an \"ugly moniker\" and that children of famous people should not be judged negatively because \"there's nothing wrong with doing or wanting to do what your parents do\".\nSimilarly, Zoe Kravitz told GQ that it was \"completely normal for people to be in the family business\", while Stranger Things actress Maya Hawke said a famous family name \"definitely gives you massive advantages in this life but the chances will not be infinite; so you have to keep working and do a good job. If you do a bad job, the chances will stop\".\nAlmost Famous star Kate Hudson, daughter of actors Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, said in a 2022 interview with the Independent that \"people call it whatever they want\", but the idea that children will follow in the footsteps of their parents is \"not going to change\".\nHudson was right that, in the three years since New York magazine's cover story caused so much controversy, nepo babies haven't slunk off into the background. In fact, they continue to thrive, particularly those with real talent.\nPam Lyddon, a PR executive in the entertainment industry says that there's \"no denying that being well-connected can absolutely help you succeed in the industry\" but \"while connections might get you noticed, you do still need genuine talent, hard work, and resilience to stay in the game - results speak for themselves and reputations are everything.\"\nShe explains that for the new wave of nepo babies, talent is even more important as the \"scrutiny is more intense and people are more media savvy\" so you can't get away with mediocrity.\nAs fans and critics continue to praise Blue Ivy, it seems that the credibility of nepo babies hasn't been damaged by the nepo baby backlash, and if you have the star factor, your parents being Beyonce and Jay-Z is only going to help you fly.",

        "article_text": "Kimi Antonelli passed his driving test earlier this year\nMiami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Dates: 2-4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary of sprint race and qualifying online; race on BBC Radio 5 Live from 20:00 BST and live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nMercedes driver Kimi Antonelli became the youngest driver to take a Formula 1 pole position in the sprint event at the Miami Grand Prix.\nThe 18-year-old beat McLaren's Oscar Piastri, the championship leader, by 0.045 seconds. The second McLaren of Lando Norris was third ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, just 0.055secs behind his team-mate.\nAntonelli's team-mate George Russell was fifth fastest, 0.309secs slower than the Italian rookie.\nIt was an outstanding performance from Antonelli, the first time he has beaten Russell in qualifying this season, and the first time he has shown a glimpse of the huge potential Mercedes believed they saw in him when they chose him to replace Lewis Hamilton for this year.\n'Not nice' to see Hamilton struggling - Russell\nAntonelli ready for 'big responsibility' of replacing Hamilton\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nAntonelli has taken a steady approach to the start of his career before this weekend, keen not to make a big mistake that could hurt his weekend.\nBut at the Hard Rock Stadium he looked sure-footed and accomplished from the start of practice and carried that form into qualifying.\n\"I am over the moon,\" he said. \"I did not expect it.\n\"I was feeling good in the car. I was able to improve lap by lap and find that consistency and that gap came all together. I am super happy with that. We will enjoy this moment but I want to focus on tomorrow because I really want to try to repeat myself.\"\nAntonelli embraced his father Marco in the Mercedes garage as the team celebrated his achievement wildly.\n\"It was really nice and also to find him in the garage after qualifying,\" Antonelli added.\n\"I am super-happy to share this moment with him. It is so important to me, he is like a rock. I can always rely on him. I would like to share it with my mum and sister as well but hopefully next time.\"\nStarting the sprint from pole gives him a big opportunity to convert it into a first win, given the power of clear air in F1.\nThis video can not be played\nFive things to watch at Miami Grand Prix\nAntonelli's previous highest grid position this season was fifth.\nPiastri, 10 points ahead of Norris in the championship heading into this weekend, said he believed a lock-up at the last corner on his final lap had cost him pole.\nNorris, who crashed in qualifying at the last race in Saudi Arabia, said: \"Close qualifying. It felt good, happy just to get a good lap in there.\n\"Today's performance was in a good ballpark, not good enough but shows how close it is and how quick the Mercedes are. Close enough that we can still aim for a pole tomorrow.\"\nAntonelli's impressive 0.309secs margin over Russell came despite the Briton joining Verstappen in being the only driver to use two sets of tyres over two runs in the final session. Everyone else waited in the pits while they went out and did just one lap.\nThe idea behind the strategy, which is tight in terms of planning because of the fast turnaround needed in the pits after the first lap, is to allow the driver to record a 'banker' lap and then go all out on the second.\nBut it worked for neither. Russell did not improve on his second lap, and while Verstappen did, he was 0.255secs slower than Antonelli and 0.21secs off Piastri.\nVerstappen, who arrived in Miami late following the birth of his first child, said: \"What we did in Q3 was good, the tyres are holding on quite well, but from P1 struggling with a lot of understeer in the car and with all the low-speed corners, you lose quite a bit of lap time.\"\nHis lack of pace came despite a new floor this weekend as the team seek improved performance.\nVerstappen added: \"In the first sector we were quite competitive because that's where a few high-speed corners are but as soon as you get to the low speed we lack quite a bit of grip. P4 is all right, you have to be realistic with the limitations we have at the moment and it was still quite close.\"\nRussell said: \"Massive congrats to Kimi. He did an amazing job. He has been really quick all day, really impressive.\n\"I have been struggling a little bit, not that comfortable, and we wanted to go early because I didn't have that confidence. P5 is not great but amazing (result) for Kimi and the team.\"\nHamilton, who won the first sprint of the season in China from pole position, was seventh fastest, one place behind team-mate Charles Leclerc. It was an improvement for Hamilton after a dire past three races, but he was still 0.222secs off his team-mate.\nNeither Ferrari driver was happy. \"It was a better session,\" Hamilton said, \"but we are just lacking speed. Keep working on it.\"\nWilliams' Alex Albon, Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso completed the top 10, only the second time the two-time champion's team has made it that high up this season, after team-mate Lance Stroll achieved it in the sprint in China.\nAlbon's team-mate Carlos Sainz should also have been in the top 10 but he made a mistake on his final lap in the second session and will line up 15th.\nVerstappen's team-mate Yuki Tsunoda was knocked out in the first session and will start the sprint 18th.\nThe Japanese complained of being held up by a car coming out of the pits on his first lap, and he did not get around his warm-up lap in time to complete a second run.\nFernando Alonso was among those to congratulate Max Verstappen on the birth of his daughter Lily\nThe youngest driver to take pole position for a full grand prix is Sebastian Vettel, at the 2008 Italian GP at Monza when he was 21 years and two months old\nMcLaren's Piastri fastest in Miami practice\n'It's so bad' - who has got their Miami GP livery right?\nWhat is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions\nMiami Grand Prix preview",

        "article_text": "Manchester United only needed a point against Manchester City to qualify for Europe\nMelvine Malard celebrated her equaliser like it was a stoppage-time winner and the Old Trafford crowd gave an outpouring of adulation. It reflected the significance of this result for Manchester United.\nNot only did they come from 2-0 down - and with 10 players after Aoife Mannion was sent off - to secure a point against bitter rivals Manchester City, it confirmed Champions League football for next season.\nFour points clear with one game left, United ended City's own hopes of playing in Europe.\nMarc Skinner's side can now prepare for a new future, looking at unique recruitment strategies and eyeing up financial gains, while City will assess where it all went wrong. \nSimply put, the 2-2 draw on Sunday was really a victory for United. \n\"To go 2-0 down, then come back, then go down to 10 players and then to see the game out... it absolutely feels like a win,\" said manager Skinner. \n\"It obviously secured Champions League football so it is a huge moment for this young team. They haven't faced many moments like that. To do it, is very special.\"\nMan Utd comeback against Man City seals Europe spot\nMan City 'fall short of standards' to miss out on Europe\nWhat's gone wrong for Man City in trophyless season?\nManchester United will compete in a third successive FA Cup final this month\nUnited have been in this position before in 2023, when they secured a Champions League spot, but failed to progress from the qualifying rounds a few months later.\nWomen's Super League champions Chelsea will go straight into the group phase of the competition next season, while second and third place go into the qualification rounds, meaning United will still have to navigate that.\nBut they want to go one step further and will attempt to attract the biggest names in Europe to compete in the competition. \nFinancially, there are rewards. Reaching the group stages of the Women's Champions League means they would receive just over \u00a3430,000 as a starting fee and bonus payments on top, depending on results.\n\"It's huge. The next step is that we have to recruit the right way,\" added Skinner.\n\"In order to go into the depths of the Champions League - and from our perspective actually qualify for the group stages - we have to add the quality of depth. \n\"Champions League gives you that. People want to come to a Champions League team. Hopefully it opens that market for us.\"\nEuropean football also gives United an elevated status in the women's game. \nThey no longer need to rely on the brand of Manchester United as a club - but the success of their performances as a team.\nIt is also a boost in their efforts to convince United co-owner, Ineos chairman, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his staff that the women's team are worth investing in. \nSkinner added: \"The club has a big status but the women's team has a young status. We qualified [for Europe] two seasons ago but now we have done it again and that does give us a big status.\n\"When we have recruitment calls, it's always about whether we get to the Champions League - that is what the agents are saying. \n\"That status opens up more doors to give us better conversations.\"\nWhile United are planning for bigger things, they must prepare well for the crucial transfer window Skinner has constantly referred to.\nWhen they last got into Europe, United signed World Cup Golden Boot winner Hinata Miyazawa, goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Brazilian winger Geyse.\nBut American Tullis-Joyce did not break into the first team until this season, alongside Miyazawa consistently, while Geyse is now on loan at Gotham FC. \nThey needed more physicality and experience, said Skinner, but the challenge this time around is to recruit players who can make an instant difference.\n\"I have not stopped all year to be honest in terms of our recruitment. We haven't just waited,\" said Skinner.\n\"We have that moment now to reflect - but it will be a big summer for us, for sure.\"\nHow will United make sure it's a successful window?\nThe club are developing their own analysis system which looks at data and statistics to help them talent spot the players who are right for them. \nTechnical director Jason Wilcox and women's head of recruitment Harvey Bussell are working together to lead the task.\n\"It's becoming much more robust. It's still in its infancy, but that's, I think, the strategy route we will go down,\" added Skinner.\n\"We've spoken as a team, we get Champions League, then we have to look at the budget and how we progress in the market. \n\"We're in a competitive market. So I've got to try to find, with my expertise, how I can make a player better.\n \"Those are the little details that we'll have to work through.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "From blossoming long-distance love to helping families stay connected, for years Skype held a unique place in people's hearts.\nIn the days before Zoom, WhatsApp and Teams, the video call service was once one of the world's most popular websites.\nIt allowed people to make computer-to-computer calls free, and then became the way users could make low cost calls to landlines and mobiles to people in other parts of the world.\nIn recent years though, Skype has been diminishing as its owner Microsoft focussed on Teams. Its services will close for good on 5 May, with the Skype for Business feature the only part to remain.\nHere are just some of the many people whose lives were touched by Skype since it launched in 2003.\nWeng and Owen Williams have a lot to thank Skype for - it is one of the main reasons they are married.\nIn 2012, Weng left Macau, China to start a six-month internship at a National Trust site in Carmarthenshire, Wales.\nFeeling a bit homesick, she would speak to friends and family on Skype. She then met Owen, who was also working for the National Trust.\nAt first they were friends, but after Weng returned to Macau, romance blossomed over months of Skype chats and visits to see one another.\n\"Skype was a very important part of our relationship,\" she said. \nWhen they decided to embark on a long-distance relationship, Skype was the glue that held it together.\nThey video called every day - including when Weng sent Owen a birthday cake and he cut it in front of her during their chat.\n\"That was quite sweet,\" she said. \"Skype just kept us going.\"\nThe pair ultimately got engaged, and Weng moved back to Wales in 2015.\nNow, they are happily married.\nLike many over the years, Erica from New Zealand used Skype to communicate with a loved one while they were in another part of the world. \nIn her case, it was her husband when one of them was on a work trip.\nFollowing his death in 2017, Skype took on another role for Erica, who spoke to the BBC anonymously.\n\"I was clearing out his files to decommission his work computer,\" she told BBC News.\n\"I had the opportunity to review these messages we had exchanged and realised how they inadvertently documented a period of distress and heartache in our relationship.\"\nWhat Erica did next tried to bring some closure to this difficult period in her life.\n\"I sent a posthumous message to his Skype address to which, I - or he - replied from his computer,\" she said.\nErica said she then began a brief conversation back and forth \"over a period of weeks\" - where she would send a message to his Skype address, then reply to herself from his account.\n\"In this exchange, we responded to each other's messages and questions with all the apologies and regret that we needed to hear from each other,\" she said. \n\"It helped me to move on. I believed it.\"\nSince 2003, Susan Bertotti has lived in Chile. Skype has been her way of keeping in touch with her mum Vera, who lives in in Milton Keynes.\nFor the past 15 years, they have spoken to each other every day they are apart on Skype.\nFrom sharing Christmas memories to showing each other their gardens in Chile and England, the video call app has been a constant.\n\"Skype has given my mother and I the most wonderful close connection all these years,\" Susan said.\nWhen she became her mum's carer, Susan used the app to deal with all her life admin back in the UK. \nAs the years went on, the family starting using WhatsApp, but they still use Skype to set up their chats. Vera is now 99.\n\"It is going to be a huge loss to me,\" Susan said.\n\"I'll be back to making lost-distance calls now on her behalf, and that will be horrible, or I'll have to email.\n\"I'm so disappointed about losing Skype.\"\nBeing able to call internationally without big fees are an important part of Stan Calderwood's business. \nOn the day it was announced the service would close, he had used it eight times to call estate agents, accountants and lawyers in Canada about the sale of a property there.\n\"You can't call everyone on WhatsApp, Zoom or Teams,\" he said.\n\"You do have to call people on their mobiles and their landlines, particularly businesses.\"\nStan is now looking for a new low-cost alternative for cheap international calls.\nWhile Skype fell away in recent years, it still had millions of users - with the website Statista stating it had almost 28 million as of March last year. \nSo what will happen now? \nMicrosoft says Skype's free services will be retired, and users have a choice - move over to Teams, or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history.\n\"The timing of this shift is driven by the significant advancements and adoption of Microsoft Teams,\" said a Microsoft spokesperson.\n\"Teams free offers many of the same core features as Skype.\"\nMeanwhile, the firm says its Skype for Business users are unaffected by the change and the service will continue. \nOne of those customers is the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Its spokesperson told the BBC the MoD is retiring most of its Skype service as it moves to Teams, but a \"small group of users\" will continue using the business version of Skype.\nFor Skype customers who pay a subscription or have credits to make calls to landlines and mobiles, they will be able to use Skype Dial Pad on Teams. When their credit or subscription ends, there will be no way to continue using it.\nSkype as we know it is going - and with it, one of the the most recognisable tech products of this century.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

        "article_text": "With days left to the election, Australian opposition candidates have been wooing a crucial group that turned its back on the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election: Chinese Australian voters.\nAnd they are trying to reach them on platforms that their party once talked of banning over national security concerns: Chinese social media apps like WeChat and RedNote.\nNearly six in 10 Chinese Australians use WeChat at least once a day, according to a poll by Lowy Institute in 2022.\nGrange Chung, who is contesting the New South Wales' seat of Reid, held by the left-leaning Labor party with a 3.2% margin, said in a video on WeChat that he chose to start his career in the navy \"to give back to the country that embraced my family when we arrived with very little\".\n\"Australia gave us a home... Let me finish what I started,\" he said in a video montage that included scenes of him putting up campaign posters and interacting with the electorate.\nDespite making up just 5.5% of Australia's population, Chinese Australians were said to be a crucial to the Labor party's win in 2022, which broke nearly a decade of rule by the Liberal-National coalition. \nChinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.\nSome analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.\nAnd now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians. \nIn order to be in with a chance of winning Reid, Grange Chung knows he needs to win over the suburb of Burwood, an area often billed as Sydney's second Chinatown, with Mandarin and Cantonese dominating conversations and the signboards for shops and restaurants.\nA former commercial pilot, Chung started posting on WeChat in February and has in recent months shared his interviews with Asian business owners, Lunar New Year greetings, and his promises to the community, where about one in five voters are ethnically Chinese.

It now holds Bennelong by a razor-thin margin.\nA recent clip shows Yung, who runs an education business, stressing what he calls the \"so, so important\" relationship between China and Australia: \"It's important for Australia, it's important for Australian businesses.\"\nHow the country manages its ties with China has an everyday impact on the lives of Chinese Australians, says Osmond Chiu, a research fellow at the Victoria-based Per Capita think tank.\n\"[The community's] concerns will include increased racism, the effect on those who do business with China and what it means for people with family in China,\" he says.\nFor some voters, the Liberals' campaign blitz on social media does not sync with its anti-migrant rhetoric. \"[Coalition leader] Peter Dutton has talked about slashing migration and international student numbers. We're feeling quite anxious about it,\" says Alex Wang, who works at a restaurant in Reid.",

Chinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.Some analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.And now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians.

On average, \u00a33.8m is spent on clothing and home products on its website and apps every day.There have also been gaps on the food shelves in some stores after the firm took some of its systems offline in an attempt to manage the attack, while its loyalty scheme and gift card payments have been disrupted too.Analysts have pointed out that M&S risks losing out to rivals, as online shoppers can quickly switch to other retailers' websites.The problems have also coincided with a period of warmer weather, when people are likely to want to buy new summer clothes.M&S shares dropped almost 2% on Friday morning, and are now down about 5% from the point when the company first disclosed its IT systems had been disrupted. Online orders paused and missing items \u2013 what we know about the M&S cyber chaos'They wanted $4m': Lessons for M&S from other cyber attacksHarrods latest retailer to be hit by cyber attack With both the Co-op and Harrods also facing cyber attacks this week, the NCSC - the UK government body responsible for supporting organisations facing cyber threats - has extended its warnings about such attacks to all organisations in the UK and urged them to be vigilant.NCSC chief executive Richard Horne said the recent spate of attacks should serve as a \"wake-up call\" for big retailers.He said the NCSC was working closely with the companies that had reported incidents, \"to fully understand the nature of these attacks and to provide expert advice to the wider sector\".Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said she was worried about the attacks and acknowledged it was concerning for customers and businesses.She told the BBC's Today programme that big retailers could be vulnerable to such attacks because they were \"high-profile businesses, we all interact with retail each and every day\".In addition, she added that they were \"highly digital businesses, not just from an online shopping point of view but retailers have lots of systems - payments systems, stock systems\".However, she said that all of the businesses affected so far have been able to keep their stores open.RetailingMarks & Spencer",

It has already racked up more than 1.4m views on TikTok.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nKeable was co-signed by Beyonc\u00e9 earlier this year, who named her as an artist who inspired her. She has achieved 2m monthly streams on Spotify and is playing Glastonbury, SXSW, Colors NYC and Meltdown festivals this summer.\nSasha is a singer now but grew up in the centre of the football world - her stepdad, Nick Broad, was head of sports science at Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea, and was working with Carlo Ancelotti as performance manager at Paris St-Germain when he died in a car accident in 2013.\n\"I've seen all sides of football, not just as a fan,\" she told BBC Sport. \"When Carlo got fired by Chelsea, my stepdad was fired too. He didn't know what he was going to do, but then Carlo went to PSG and asked him to go with him.\n\"Sadly he passed away while he was in Paris but we are still close to the Ancelotti family. He and Carlo were such good friends.\n\"I look back now and my stepdad was a real pioneer in his work in sports science and nutrition. The things he introduced, like GPS tracking in training and collecting cardio data, were all new then but they are industry standard now.\n\"It's incredible to see his work live on in that way. Some of his old friends and colleagues reach out to me now when they see me doing my own thing on social media and talk about how his work was incredible. \n\"I always wonder how much further he could have pushed the use of science in football if he was still here, but I'm so pleased you can still see his legacy.\"\nNick Broad (right) celebrates with Carlo Ancelotti (centre) after Chelsea's FA Cup win in 2010, which completed a double of Premier League and FA Cup that season\nBefore becoming a singer, Sasha dreamed of being a footballer herself. Now she settles for collecting shirts instead, with a Tino Asprilla Colombia shirt from 1994 taking pride of place.\n\"I played all the time when I was a kid, from the age of about six,\" explained Sasha.\n\"It was a bit different for girls then because it was before the women's game really took off and you didn't really have a route to becoming a professional in this country. I wanted to go to the United States to play. \n\"I was quite a tomboy so I used to play with the boys all the time - I had to. We did not even have a girls team at my school until my friends and I asked to play with the boys and, after that, they formed a team for us.\n\"Fortunately it's all changed now and football is so much more accessible for girls. If you don't have the chance to try something, how do you know if you will love it?\"\nChris Sutton and Sasha Keable were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nEtihad Stadium, 20:00 BST\nThis should be a great game, because Wolves are so powerful and they will have no fear at all after winning six games in a row.\nBut Manchester City have looked much more solid in the past few weeks and they are on a bit of a roll themselves, with four successive wins in all competitions.\nPep Guardiola's side will look to control this game, the same way they did in the first half of their FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest, but I don't think they will find it easy to keep Wolves quiet.\nStill, I went against City in their last home game, against Aston Villa, and I was wrong. I am not going to make the same mistake again.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: This is a tough game for City but I still think they will win. 2-1\nVilla Park, 12:30 BST\nIt would be easy to say the wheels have come off at Aston Villa, wouldn't it? \nIn the past couple of weeks, they have gone out of the Champions League and FA Cup, and losing their last Premier League game has left them playing catch-up in the top-five race.\nI don't think Unai Emery's side will crumble from here, though, even if Marcus Rashford's season-ending injury is a big blow.\nVilla need to win this, and they also need a big performance from Ollie Watkins. If he starts banging the goals in again then that would be a huge boost for their run-in.\nFulham are a nightmare to predict, as I've mentioned in previous weeks, and they are certainly capable of getting something here.\nI don't think Villa can keep a clean sheet - which probably means they will stop Fulham scoring - but I have a feeling things will click for them in front of goal.\nAlso, they are at home too so, if they need them, their fans can help to get them over the line.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nSasha's prediction: I want to back Fulham here, for south-west London. 0-3\nGoodison Park, 15:00 BST\nI am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live and I am really looking forward to going to Goodison Park again.\nEverything points towards a home win, despite Everton losing their previous two games. \nIpswich are definitely down now and, while they won't throw in the towel, they might be a little less spirited now they know they are relegated.\nTheir confidence has been sapped over the course of the season and, after watching them recently, I can't back them to get anything here. \nThey were flimsy against Arsenal, then well beaten by Newcastle, and it would be a shock if they scored at all, let alone break my record for the fastest goal scored by an away player at Goodison.\nEverton have stuttered in the past couple of weeks but I don't think that is a bad thing for David Moyes. \nHe has over-achieved since taking charge in January, when the reality is that he has got the same group of players as his predecessor, Sean Dyche, and there needs to be a lot of work done on improving that squad in the summer.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I am not sure if Ipswich will put up as much of a fight now they are relegated. 1-0\nKing Power Stadium, 15:00 BST\nLeicester have been rotten but, somehow, Southampton have been even worse.\nIt's sad to see Jamie Vardy leaving the Foxes at the end of the season, but maybe this might be the send-off he deserves. I am going with him to score the winner.\nThese two teams actually served up a thriller at St Mary's Stadium back in October, when Vardy got one of Leicester's goals as they fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\nI am expecting the same outcome here, just with a lot less excitement. The readers will go for a draw, I am sure of it, but I am pretty confident about Leicester taking this one.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nSasha's prediction: It's mad how bad both these teams have been. I don't think either of them will get a goal, let alone the win. 0-0\nEmirates Stadium, 17:30 BST\nWe know how dangerous Bournemouth are, because they beat Arsenal in October, and if Mikel Arteta rests players then this game becomes even harder for the Gunners.\nIt's a tricky situation for Arteta, because he will want to head to Paris St-Germain for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with a bit of momentum, but he has got to balance that with the risk of injury to his key players.\nBournemouth's form has improved of late, and the circumstances mean they definitely have a decent chance of doing the double over Arsenal this season.\nThis all boils down to what the Arsenal team is, so it is difficult to make a call without knowing that, but they are at home and even if they are not at full strength then I can still see them getting a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's a strange situation for Arsenal but I am still backing us to win. 2-0\nGtech Community Stadium, 14:00 BST\nWe know Manchester United are going to make changes here, because seeing out the second leg of their Europa League semi-final with Athletic Bilbao is their priority.\nRuben Amorim's side nicked a point at the very end of their game at Bournemouth last weekend, which sparked mass celebrations, but I really don't see them doing the same against Brentford - they won't be getting the bunting out this time.\nThe Bees are such a dangerous team when they come forward and they will keep on attacking United. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa should get plenty of chances and I can see them getting a goal or two between them.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I just have a feeling United will nick this. 0-1\nAmex Stadium, 14:00 BST\nBrighton got back to winning ways last weekend thanks to Carlos Baleba's brilliant late strike against West Ham.\nThe Seagulls beat Newcastle at St James' Park earlier in the season too, but that was before Eddie Howe's side hit their stride, and it is a big ask for Brighton to repeat that result.\nNewcastle were just relentless in their win over Ipswich and another three points here would be massive in their bid for a top-five finish - I don't think they will get them, but we will see a few goals.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2\nSasha's prediction: Newcastle will take this one. 0-2\nLondon Stadium, 14:00 BST\nThis is 17th versus 16th in the Premier League which tells you how bad both teams have been this season.\nEveryone knows Tottenham's focus will be on their Europa League semi-final second leg with Bodo/Glimt so I think West Ham boss Graham Potter needs a result here more than Ange Postecoglou.\nPotter's results have been poor since he took over from Julen Lopetegui in January and the Hammers fans have not had the upturn they wanted in the way their team play either.\nSpurs can still be dangerous even when they are out of form but Ange is not going to pick his strongest team. That gives West Ham a better chance of getting the win they badly need, but I don't see them doing it in style.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: I don't want to say Tottenham will win, but I think they will. 1-2\nStamford Bridge, 16:30 BST\nI would usually be asking which Chelsea side will turn up, but that applies to Liverpool too this week.\nArne Slot's side could have been out all week celebrating their title win and we don't know how that will affect them.\nYou often play at your best when you have been on the lash in a scenario like theirs. For example, some of my best games for Celtic came after nights out where we had won something and were allowed to have a couple of beers, but I don't know what to expect here.\nChelsea have nicked a couple of results recently, to stay in the race for the top five, but their performances have not been too convincing and their fans still don't seem to have taken to Enzo Maresca's playing style.\nThis is not the test for them that it would be if Liverpool were trying to close out the title but I don't think Slot is the type to let anyone take their foot off the gas. He will put out a strong team and even if they play with more freedom, I still think Liverpool will leave with the points.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nSasha's prediction: I still have a connection with Chelsea because of my stepdad and I have got to back them here. 3-0\nSelhurst Park, 20:00 BST\nCrystal Palace will be on a high after booking their place in the FA Cup final, so this is another very tricky game for Nottingham Forest, who slipped up at home against Brentford on Thursday.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side will have to be stubborn and resolute to get anything at Selhurst Park. They have shown that kind of character plenty of times already this season but they really need it now.\nLooking at the race for the top five you feel like every team involved needs to win every game, but of course that is not going to happen, and I can see my boyhood team Forest dropping more points here. I just hope it doesn't prove crucial for them.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's got to be Palace here. I am loyal to the London teams! 3-0\nChris got five correct results with one exact score from the nine Premier League games he predicted in week 34, giving him a total of 80 points.\nHe beat his guest, golf hero Lee Westwood, who got four correct results with no exact scores, leaving him on 40 points and tied with the BBC readers, who also got five correct results with one exact score.\nWestwood and the BBC readers were wrong about both FA Cup semi-finals, while Chris correctly picked City to beat Forest and wrongly thought Aston Villa would beat Crystal Palace. Those ties do not count towards the weekly totals.\nThe other game from week 34, Manchester City's 2-1 win over Aston Villa, took place on 22 April and does not count towards the weekly result either.\nSherelle, the guest in week 33, made the prediction instead of Westwood and picked up 40 points for the guests' overall total (but not her own individual tally) with an exact score. Chris and the BBC readers both went for a 2-1 Villa win.",

He said the administration had been \"very successful\" in taking on Yemen's Houthis and \"the president led on that\".\nIn March, lawmakers questioned some of the other Signal chat participants at hearings, including the director of national intelligence and the director of the CIA.\nThe UN ambassador position remains unfilled. Trump withdrew the nomination of his first pick, New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, amid Republican concerns about preserving their slender majority in the House of Representatives. \nMinnesota Governor and former Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz made light of the national security adviser's exit on Thursday.\nHe posted on X: \"Mike Waltz has left the chat.\"\nWaltz has continued to use Signal, according to an image captured by a Reuters photographer at a White House cabinet meeting on Wednesday.\nThe zoomed-in picture showed Waltz checking his phone and a chat ongoing with a contact saved under the name of JD Vance, who is US vice-president.\nThe message from the Vance contact read in part: \"I have confirmation from my counterpart it's turned off. He is going to be here.\"\nIn an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday evening, Vance rejected any suggestion that Waltz had been fired, saying he was actually being promoted.\n\"I like Mike,\" said Vance. \"I think he's a great guy. He's got the trust of both me and the president.\n\"But we also thought that he'd make a better UN ambassador as we get beyond this stage.\"\nTrump's announcement, meanwhile, of the latest role for Rubio appeared to catch state department officials off guard.\nRubio will now be the first official to serve both as secretary of state and national security adviser since Henry Kissinger half a century ago. \nRubio is also acting head of both the gutted United States Agency for International Development and the National Archives.\nSome reports suggest Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer and personal friend of Trump who is currently a US Special Envoy to the Middle East, could ultimately replace Waltz.\nAnother name being touted as a potential candidate by some in Washington is also one of Trump's special envoys, Ric Grenell, who has a longer diplomatic track record.\nTrump went through four national security advisers in his first term. The first, Michael Flynn, served for just three weeks. \nAnother, John Bolton, later wrote an unflattering book about Trump. \nBolton told the BBC on Thursday that Waltz's removal was reminiscent of the \"chaos\" from Trump's first term.",

        "article_text": "\"It's not our night,\" Australia's opposition leader Peter Dutton told a roomful of supporters in Brisbane after his rival, Anthony Albanese, was re-elected as prime minister. \nIt was indeed a bruising night for Dutton, a 54-year-old political veteran who also lost his parliamentary seat of 24 years to a candidate from Albanese's Labor Party. \nThis is a big win for the prime minister, who made a surprising comeback to secure a comfortable majority for a second term. But it's an even bigger loss for Dutton and his Liberal National Coalition. \nDutton initially seemed to have an advantage over the incumbent PM who was battling a cost-of-living crisis and dismal ratings. But that advantage vanished as the campaign wore on, ending in a humiliating defeat.\nAn awkward and inconsistent campaign that did not do enough to reassure voters was partly to blame. But there is no mistaking the big part played by what some have called the \"Trump effect\". \nDutton, whether he liked it or not, was a man who many saw as Australia's Trump - but as it turns out Australians do not appear to want that. \nDutton's brand of hard-line conservatism, his support for controversial immigration policies \u2013 like sending asylum seekers to offshore detention centres \u2013 and his fierce criticism of China, all led to comparisons with US President Donald Trump.\nIt's a likeness he has rejected but then the Coalition pursued policies that seemed to have been borrowed from the Trump administration.\nDutton said that if elected he would cut public sector jobs - more than 40,000 by some estimates. This reminded voters of billionaire Elon Musk's Doge, or Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed US bureaucracy. Dutton later walked back the plan. \nThe Coalition even appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency. And images of her wearing a cap with the words Maga - short for the popular Trump slogan, Make America Great Again - have become a key talking point.  \nNone of this served Dutton well and he knew it. Towards the end of the campaign, he tried to shake off Trump's shadow, and in the final leaders' debate he repeatedly told the audience that he didn't know Trump before attempting to answer questions on him.\n\"The Coalition will probably regret issuing messages that came across as supporting Trump and opposing the US Democrats,\" said Frank Mols, a political science lecturer at the University of Queensland. \n\"Once the stock markets started to drop in response to the uncertainty created by the [Trump's] tariffs, it became harder for the Coalition to profile itself as a safer pair of hands for the economy.\"\nThe talk of trade wars and tariffs increased voters' worries. Speaking to people across Australia \u2013 the BBC travelled to Perth in Western Australia and Melbourne in the final week of campaigning \u2013 it was clear that global politics only became more important through the campaign.\nAustralia has long balanced its military alliance with the US and its economic relationship with China, its biggest trading partner. \nBut a US-China trade war, along with an unpredictable White House, is tricky territory for any country - even a US ally like Australia. \nCould Dutton provide stability in these unusual times?  \nDutton had long tried to convince voters that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with Trump. He often cited his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term.\nBut in the end voters weren't convinced. \nDutton's own inconsistent policies and the Trump-esque rhetoric and decisions appear to have driven away an electorate that is deeply concerned about a new, tumultuous world order.\n\"Our message was confusing... Labor had a tight and very disciplined campaign,\" Jitendra Prasad, a LNP supporter, told the BBC as he was about to leave the watch party on Saturday night after a disappointing outcome. \nThat was evident in the swings towards Labor across the country, which led to a fairly quick, emphatic result. \nTowards the end of the campaign, Dutton also embraced the right-wing One Nation Party, which some Coalition members had warned was the wrong move. And it didn't seem to have helped. Rather, it may have hurt him. \n\"They just read the rooms incorrectly,\" says Ben Wellings, associate professor of Politics and International Relations at Monash University.\n\"It was one of the things that we always say about the electorate in Australia  - it's a small C conservative and maybe the radical right message was just in the end, too radical and seemed too disruptive.\"\nWhat also didn't help was that Dutton's was never a smooth campaign. \nThere were gaffes, such as when he accidentally hit a cameraman with a football, and costly missteps, like getting the price of a carton of eggs wrong during an election debate - his guess (A$4.20) was, in fact, half the actual price.\nIt was not a good look in an election where cost-of-living has been a dominant theme.\n\"Dutton has seemed more comfortable attacking Labor than presenting a strong alternative,\" says Jacob Broom, a lecturer in politics and policy at Murdoch University in Perth.\n\"I think it has been effective for Labor to point to the Liberals voting against cost-of-living measures like the tax cuts which they proposed toward the end of the term.\"\nWhile Dutton criticised Labour's tax relief measures and spending, he then announced that he would also effect tax rebates and big spends, including billions to boost defence and fix an ailing public healthcare system.\nBut at the same time he also promised cuts. Analysts say this inconsistency confused voters and became an unfortunate theme in his campaign.\nHe announced and then walked back plans for huge changes to the bureaucracy, including job cuts and the plans to end work from home arrangements. He said it was \"a mistake\".\nBut \"the backflips on working from home and his uncertainty over public service cuts,\" complicated his message, according to John Warhurst, Emeritus Professor, Australian National University.\nThe result, many believe, was the lack of a coherent campaign. \n\"I think people couldn't understand Dutton's policies,\" a member of Dutton's own party in his Dickson constituency told the BBC earlier on Saturday. \nHe wondered if Dutton's support for nuclear energy put people off - an issue that analysts such as Dr Mols said could have worked against him because Australian voters had not \"warmed up\" to the idea of nuclear energy.  \nUltimately, the biggest issue this election - cost-of-living - may have helped Labor cement its message that theirs was the steadier hand. \nEvanthia Smith, another voter in Dutton's Dickson seat, said she voted for Labor because she believed their candidate would do more to improve public education and access to healthcare.\nDutton acknowledged the huge loss the Coalition had faced: \"Our Liberal family is hurting across the country tonight, including in my electorate of Dickson... We'll rebuild from here.\" \nIt was the same advice a supporter in Brisbane had for the party: \"The party needs to go back to the drawing block and look at their policies. We need to focus on the typical issues: Housing, cost-of-living - they are the biggest.\"",

        "article_text": "On Friday morning, a spokesperson for China's ministry of commerce announced that Beijing was assessing the possibility of tariff negotiations with the United States.\nIt was news the rest of the world had been waiting to hear as astonishingly high  tariffs - up to 245% on some Chinese exports to the US - throttle trade between the world's two biggest economies, raising the spectre of a recession. \n\"US officials have repeatedly expressed their willingness to negotiate with China on tariffs,\" the spokesperson told reporters.\n\"China's position is consistent. If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open... If the US wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be prepared to correct its wrong practices and cancel unilateral tariffs.\"\nThe statement comes a day after a Weibo account linked to Chinese state media said the US had been seeking to initiate discussions, and a week after Trump claimed discussions were already underway \u2013 a suggestion Beijing denied.\n\"China has no need to talk to the United States,\" Yuyuantantian, a Weibo account affiliated with China Central Television (CCTV), said in Thursday's post. \"From the perspective of negotiations, the United States must be the more anxious party at present.\"\nSuch comments follow a cycle of assertions and denials from both the US and China, as each side refuses to publicly initiate discussions.\nThe question is not whether those discussions will take place, but rather when, under what circumstances and at whose behest. \nExperts characterise the tussle as a game of chicken between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, as both men attempt to save face while covertly pursuing a mutually beneficial outcome \u2013 namely, a de-escalation of the trade war.\n\"I expect some of this back-and-forth, because neither Washington nor Beijing wants to look like they are the side that's giving in,\" says Ja Ian Chong, assistant professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. \n\"[But] a de-escalation would be to the overall benefit of both sides, so there is some overarching incentive to do so.\"\nWen-Ti Sung, an academic member of the Australian Centre on China in the World, puts it another way: \"It's like two race cars going at each other: whoever swerves first will be seen as the weaker of the two parties. And at this juncture, neither party wants to look soft.\"\nThe leader who admits he was the first to initiate tariff talks would be seen as the one compromising his position in negotiations. \n\"Whoever seems desperate loses bargaining leverage,\" Mr Sung says. \"Both sides want to portray the other side as the more desperate one.\"\nThis peculiar stalemate \u2013 where both parties seek the same outcome, but neither wants to be the first to suggest it \u2013 has resulted in a tactic of \"constructive ambiguity\": the deliberate use of language so vague that each party could arguably claim to be in the right.\nIt is this tactic that Mr Sung points to as an explanation for Yuyuantantian's Weibo post.\n\"This is Beijing trying to explore the possibility of using word games to create an off-ramp for both sides, so that they can gradually climb their way down from this escalation spiral,\" he says.\nOne way to escape this game of chicken is when a third party mediates, offering both sides an off-ramp. The other option, Mr Sung explains, is a \"much looser understanding of what 'the other side has reached out' means\". \nThat way, the side that does indeed come to the table first is still able to characterise it as a response rather than the first move.  \nIn Trump and Xi's case, it would also mean that tariff negotiations could begin with both leaders claiming to have achieved some kind of victory in the trade war.\nThe optics here are important. As Mr Chong points out, de-escalation is one thing \u2013 but another top priority for Trump and Xi is to \"deliver a win for their domestic audiences\".\n\"Trump obviously wants to show that he has made Beijing capitulate. And on the People's Republic of China side, Xi probably wants to show his own people and the world that he's been able to make Trump become more reasonable and moderate and accommodating,\" Mr Chong says.\nOn the domestic front, both leaders are facing tariff-induced headwinds. Trump this week struggled to quell fears of a recession as fresh data indicated the US economy contracted in its first quarter for the first time since 2022.\nMeanwhile, Xi - who before the tariffs was already battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment - must reassure China's population that he can weather the trade war and protect an economy which has struggled to rebound post-pandemic.\n\"Both [Trump and Xi] recognise that at this point of the trade war, it's not going to be a winner-takes-all outcome for either side anymore,\" Mr Sung says.\n\"Trump recognises he's not going to get anywhere near 100% of what he wants, so he's trying to find a concession point where China can let him have just enough winning, especially for domestic purposes.\"\nWhile China is not unwilling, he adds, \"they are very much stuck on what's the right price point\". \nFor Xi, Mr Sung described the situation as a \"two-level game\".\n\"The China side needs to manage US-China bilateral negotiations, while domestically Beijing needs to save enough face so that the Chinese leadership can hold on to this narrative of 'the East is rising and the West is declining',\" he says.\n\"A kowtowing of the East towards the West is not a rising East.\"\nAt the time of writing, the US has not denied China's claims that it has been attempting to initiate talks. But the fact that both sides have now made that assertion indicates there is \"some sort of contact\", according to Mr Chong.\n\"The two sides are talking,\" he says. \"And that is a sign that there is some possibility that some accommodation could be reached.\"\nBut the start of negotiations does not mean that the US-China relationship - which was rocky even before Trump kicked off a trade war - is close to being steadied. \nMr Chong isn't holding his breath. For one, he believes the \"posturing\" suggests the two sides have not reached the point \"where they are both trying to seek a way out\". \n\"[Each party] may hope that there are concessions from the other side, so they're going to have this standoff until they see which side blinks first.\"\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

But the series went on to be an Emmy-nominated, critically acclaimed, six-season hit, and it put the star of the 1984 film, Ralph Macchio, back in the limelight. Now Macchio is starring in a Karate Kid sequel, Karate Kid Legends, featuring Ben Wang as the new Kid on the block, a Chinese teenager who learns to fight bullies in New York. Confusingly, Legends follows the continuity of the original Karate Kid films, as well as the Cobra Kai series, but it also brings in Jackie Chan's Mr Han, who was in the 2010 Karate Kid remake. Still, Macchio promises that all the elements in this shared universe will be in balance \u2013 and as Mr Miyagi once explained, \"Balance is key\". \"Once we were able to line that up, for the Cobra Kai story to lead into the new film \u2013 even though they're separate ecosystems \u2013 it all made sense for me,\" Macchio said in Variety. \"Then, working with Jackie was just super exciting. I started this on the big screen. How cool is it to get it back to the big screen?\"\nReleased on 28, 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally\nDanny and Michael Philippou are the Australian twins who made Talk to Me, a terrifically creepy indie horror film which was an international hit in 2023. It was such a success, in fact, that you might have expected the Philippous to move straight onto a sequel, or even to a Hollywood blockbuster. Instead, the brothers stayed in their hometown of Adelaide and made another low-budget horror film with an original story: Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a foster mother, Laura, who is trying to contact the dead. Thematically, this supernatural chiller is closely related to Talk to Me, although it's been given extra depth by a death in the Philippou family.\u00a0\"We were doing pre-production meetings, then we started shooting, and there was no time to properly sort through those emotions,\" Danny Philippou said in Den of Geek. \"They sort of poured themselves out in the script and in conversations with Sally, so that bled into the character of Laura and scenes that were meant to be scary suddenly turned sad. I think there's a rawness in it that wasn't in Talk to Me.\"\nReleased on 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally\nThe co-director of Deaf President Now!, Nyle DiMarco, says that his documentary tells \"the story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of\". Its setting is Gallaudet University in Washington DC, the world's first university for deaf and hard of hearing students. Gallaudet was established in 1864, but for more than a century, none of its presidents was deaf. In 1988, when the board of trustees appointed yet another hearing president over two deaf candidates, the students wouldn't stand for it. Eight days of protests followed \u2013 and four of the protesters are interviewed in the film. Co-directed by Davis Guggenheim, who made the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and Still: A Michael J Fox Movie, Deaf President Now! is \"a firebrand historical documentary that is as crowd-pleasing and informative as it is innovative and inclusive\", says Marya E Gates at RobertEbert.com.\nReleased on 16 May on Apple+ internationally\nThere were five Final Destination films from 2000 to 2011, all with the same structure. First, there would be a spectacular catastrophe; then this sequence would be revealed to be someone's premonition; then the person who had the premonition would save a handful of people from the catastrophe when it actually happened; but then those people would be claimed by Death, one by one, usually via complicated accidents. Now the gleefully grisly franchise is back from the dead, so prepare to squeal and squirm at yet more ingeniously nasty killings. But Final Destination: Bloodlines has moved on from the previous films in one respect. According to the trailer, it turns out that all of the victims in the previous five films were descended from people who were saved from one particular catastrophe, decades ago. That means that the film isn't just about a group of strangers, but a family that is trying to break an inherited curse. \"Suddenly, the five films are not just one fun, gory rollercoaster ride after another, but a series with a lot of interweaving emotional weight,\" says Shawn Van Horn in Collider. \"Those stronger relationships are going to make the characters more three-dimensional, and we'll likely be rooting for their survival rather than relishing in the bloodshed.\" Well\u2026 maybe.\nReleased on 14, 15 and 16 May in cinemas internationally\nIn 2018, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour finished with Blake Lively's glamorous killer being jailed for 20 years, and with Anna Kendrick's widowed mother finding fame as a crime-solving vlogger, so a sequel didn't seem likely. But the film prided itself on its outrageous plot twists, so maybe it's appropriate that, seven years on, Lively's character is not just free from prison, but is about to marry a wealthy Italian on the island of Capri \u2013 and she is determined that her old frenemy should be her maid of honour. A Simple Favour was a devilish comedy noir that treated viewers to deceit, betrayal, murder, and the sight of Lively sipping martinis while wearing absurdly stylish outfits. Another Simple Favour is even more lavish in its fashions, and even more head-spinning in its plotting. Kristy Puchko in Mashable calls it a \"shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humour, relish in mob drama [and] plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre\". Fans of the first film will \"cherish this divinely twisted thriller\".\u00a0\nReleased on 1 May on Prime Video internationally\nTim Robinson, a Saturday Night Live alumnus with his own sketch show, Netflix's I Think You Should Leave, has his first big-screen leading role in Friendship. And, true to form, it will make you cringe as much as laugh. Robinson plays Craig, a suburban office worker who is too awkward to have any real friends. Then he meets his neighbour, Brian (Paul Rudd), a weatherman who plays in a punk band in his spare time, which makes him fabulously cool by Craig's standards. Craig is thrilled to hang out with his Brian and his buddies, but after he ruins one social occasion too many, Brian \"breaks up\" with him, and he spirals out of control. Written and directed by Andrew DeYoung, this bromantic black comedy is \"feverishly and hilariously demented\", says Nick Schager in the Daily Beast. \"Partnered with the always ridiculous Rudd, Robinson reconfirms his standing as the reigning master of discomfort. Together, they make Friendship the funniest movie of the year.\"\nReleased on 9 May in the US\nAdmittedly, the last of Disney's live-action remakes, Snow White, was (a) dogged by controversy, and (b) not very good, but Lilo & Stitch looks a lot more promising. The film retells the story a genetically engineered, blue-furred alien called Experiment 626, or Stitch. He is so destructive that he is condemned to be exiled to an asteroid, but he escapes from the interstellar authorities and crash-lands on Earth, where he is befriended by a Hawaiian girl, Lilo. The original 2002 film, then, was one of the few Disney cartoons to have a modern-day US setting, and one of the few to mix contemporary human beings with fantastical creatures \u2013 so, for once, a remake that has both live-action and CGI characters makes total sense. Another good sign is that the film is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, who made the Oscar-nominated charmer Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. And a third key factor is that, in the trailers, Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, seems to have the most adorable chemistry with an alien since Drew Barrymore was in ET The Extra Terrestrial.\nReleased on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally\nNicolas Cage doesn't appear in many subtle dramas these days, so you may not be surprised to hear that The Surfer is \"a gloriously demented B-movie thriller\", as Xan Brooks puts it in The Observer, or that Cage cranks \"the acting dial from befuddled to vexed to outraged to volcanic\". He plays an unnamed businessman who has returned to Australia after years in California, and who wants to buy the beachfront house where he grew up. But when he tries to surf in a nearby bay, he is harassed by a gang of locals led by a shamanic thug (Julian McMahon). Cage's character won't be put off, though, and camps out in the car park above the beach, sacrificing his possessions and his sanity in the process. \"Crisply scripted by Thomas Martin and directed by Lorcan Finnegan with a pleasing, no-frills intensity,\" says Brooks, \"The Surfer [is] a low-budget, hard-hitting comic bruiser of a picture: a midlife-crisis movie dressed up as a 1970s exploitation flick [with a] wild, roiling, hallucinogenic vibe.\"\nReleased on 2 May in the US and Canada, 9 May in the UK and Ireland, and 15 May in Australia\nJane Austen may be turning 250 in December, but film and TV directors are as smitten by her novels as ever. Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden are starring in a new Netflix adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and before that there is a French romantic comedy drama, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, written and directed by Laura Piani. Camille Rutherford stars as Agathe, who works in a bookshop in Paris, but dreams of becoming an author. With the encouragement of her friend Felix (Pablo Pauly), she accepts the offer of a writing residency in England set up by the Austen estate. Will she finish her novel at last? Will she come to see Felix as more than a friend? Or will she fall for one of the residency's organisers (Charlie Anson), a handsome toff who happens to be the great-great-great-great-nephew of Austen\u00a0herself? \"The film is a delightful ode to Jane Austen's novels, serving up a unique blend of humour and introspection that reflects both European sensibilities and the particular quirks of Austen's world,\" says Louisa Moore in Screen Zealots.\nReleased on 16 May in Spain, 23 May in the US, and 30 May in the UK\nThe original Mission: Impossible TV series ran for just seven years, but the film series has been running for 29 \u2013 and its star, Tom Cruise, does plenty of running himself. Could the franchise be coming to a conclusion at last? The subtitle of the eighth instalment, Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning, suggests that Ethan Hunt won't be choosing to accept any more missions after this one, so this could be the last time we'll see Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell crashing cars and jumping off buildings. On the other hand, Cruise is refusing to confirm whether or not Hunt will live to fight another day. \"You gotta see the movie,\" he told Empire magazine. \"It's a hard thing for me to discuss at the moment, because it really is something that you have to experience.\" The film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, is also being cagey, but he does acknowledge that the word \"Final\" is in there for a reason. \"It is, I hope, the satisfying conclusion to a 30-year story arc,\" he says. \"I'm pretty confident that people are going to feel that the title was appropriate.\"\nReleased on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally\nIt seems as if writers and directors can't stop celebrating/ satirising the luxurious lifestyles \u2013 and enviable kitchens \u2013 of the super-rich, whether in such television series as The White Lotus, The Perfect Couple and Your Friends and Neighbors, or in such films as Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness and Blink Twice. The sharpest of all of these depictions is Succession, Jesse Armstrong's multiple Emmy-winning series about a Murdoch-alike media dynasty. And now, two years after Succession concluded its run, Armstrong returns to the territory he has made his own. Mountainhead is a comedy drama shot in Park City, Utah, starring Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith and Ramy Youssef as billionaire tech bros on holiday in a ski resort during a global crisis. The film wasn't even shot until March this year, so Armstrong and his team must be editing it at lightning speed. Could that mean that Mountainhead will be the most topical fictional commentary on the 1% so far?\nReleased on 31 May on HBO and Max, and 1 June on Sky and NOW\n\"After years of misfires, disappointments, and a growing sense of superhero fatigue, the MCU looks poised for a comeback with the highly anticipated arrival of Thunderbolts,\" says Linda Marric in HeyUGuys, \"a gritty but mostly fun new adventure that just might put Marvel back on top.\" The idea behind this rough-edged spy caper is that Marvel's least powerful, least glamorous, and least fulfilled superheroes have been carrying out covert missions for a shady businesswoman (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When she decides that they're expendable, these grumpy loners are forced to form a ragtag team consisting of Florence Pugh's Yelena, David Harbour's Red Guardian, Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, Wyatt Russell's US Agent, and Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost. \"It is a film that makes us truly care about its characters and their well-being,\" says Marric. \"It's gritty, chaotic and sometimes uneven, but also thrilling and unexpectedly heartfelt. Best of all, it proves Marvel can still surprise us when it stops trying to please everyone and leans into the weirdness.\"\u00a0\nOut now in cinemas internationally\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "For just two weeks each spring, a rare violet artichoke is harvested by hand on Venice's northern islands \u2013 and locals go to great lengths to keep it authentic.\nThe water glitters in the sunlight as Venetian farmer Guia da Camerino steers her boat past the briccole, the wooden piles that mark invisible \u2013 to non-Venetians \u2013 lanes through the lagoon. Just a few kilometres north of Venice's warren of tourist-packed streets are the islands of Sant'Erasmo and Le Vignole, known as \"the vegetable garden of Venice\" for their lush, fertile ground \u2013 and for a rare flower that grows for only 10 days a year.\nDa Camerino is one of just four farmers on the island of Le Vignole, and she specialises in the carciofo violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a Venetian type of artichoke plant that produces a local delicacy known as a castra\u00f9ra. The castra\u00f9re are the plant's first buds: small, tight and conical artichokes that are \"castrated\" off the plant \u2013 giving them their name \u2013 in order to allow the botoli, larger buds (and the kind you'd probably find on your plate the rest of the year), to grow in their place.\nSpring is a busy time of year for da Camerino as the violet artichokes come into bloom and must be harvested during a short window of about two weeks, with each plant only producing one castra\u00f9ra a year. The tiny artichokes, half the size of a human palm, are highly prized, both for their rarity and their unique, saline taste.\n\"It's hard to describe the taste if you've never had it before,\" she explains, as we walk through her artichoke fields, the belltowers of Venice visible on the horizon. \"It's initially bitter but transforms into sweetness in the mouth. It's very versatile and easy to eat \u2013 not like a Roman artichoke that you have to peel and prepare laboriously. The castra\u00f9re are so tender that you can eat them raw.\"\nThe castra\u00f9re's rarity means that for years Venetian farmers have had to deal with counterfeit versions coming from elsewhere in Italy. The violet artichoke doesn't just grow in the Veneto \u2013 this species of plant is also grown in Tuscany, Sardinia and Sicily. But any Venetian will tell you that a true Sant'Erasmo artichoke tastes nothing like its terraferma counterparts. That's because the islands are positioned at the lagoon's opening to the Adriatic, which makes the soil distinctively salty \u2013 a salinity that is tempered by rainwater. There's even a festival dedicated to the artichoke (usually on the second Sunday in May) when people travel from all over the lagoon to Sant'Erasmo to eat artichoke dishes, drink artichoke-based spritzes or digestifs and buy entire pallets of the vegetable to take home before the season ends.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nIt's not easy to coax the flower out of the plant. Everything is done by hand, with no pesticides, and in Venice there's the ever-present danger of an acqua alta (seasonal flooding) that could drown the fields. An artichoke is a perennial plant that has to be cut back every summer in order to grow imperceptibly during the winter months. Now climate change is causing the season to arrive earlier and earlier.\n\"It's very worrying,\" says da Camerino. \"The plant needs nine months to slowly grow. Traditionally, the castra\u00f9re were harvested on 25 April, Saint Mark's Day. But we harvested our first castra\u00f9ra at the beginning of April this year. It's getting hotter earlier and earlier, and the plants won't have time to grow. Eventually, the castra\u00f9re could disappear.\"\nBecause they're so delicate, the castra\u00f9re don't get exported far out of the lagoon and are usually harvested, sold and eaten in the same day. Da Camerino sells directly to restaurants in Venice that \"understand the quality\" of the product. The problem, she says, is that many restaurants in Venice have stopped buying real castra\u00f9re \"because they're expensive and non-local customers can't tell the difference. So they use normal artichokes but pretend they're castra\u00f9re so they can hike up the prices.\"\nHow to try castra\u00f9re\n\u2022 Plan a trip to Venice around mid-April to hit the height of the castra\u00f9re season.\n\u2022 Always ring ahead to see if restaurants are serving them, since it's so dependent on the harvest.\n\u2022 If you want to try preparing them at home, make sure you only buy artichokes with the consorzio's label \u2013 and don't be afraid to grill the seller about where they come from.\n\u2022 If you miss the season, don't worry; you can buy a jar of violet artichokes preserved in oil from Finotello's farm on Sant'Erasmo.\n\u2022 You can also get them in liquid form: the amaro digestif Venesian is made from Sant'Erasmo artichokes. Pick up a bottle to take home at the delicatessen Maramao, which sells local products from its canalside shop in the Cannaregio district.\nAl Covino, a Venice restaurant that focuses on local produce and traditional ingredients recognised by Italy's Slow Food presidium, makes a point of serving the castra\u00f9re when they come into season. It's a cosy space with pistachio-green roof beams, hanging plants and only 15 covers, hidden on a small street in the city's Castello neighbourhood and run by husband-and-wife team Claudio De Lauzieres and Claudia Torcellan. De Lauzieres, a Neopolitan who has been living in Venice for 12 years,\u00a0rhapsodises about the local ingredients with a boyish enthusiasm: \"Neapolitan cuisine is much more well-known than Venetian cuisine, but the lagoon offers so many different environments and unique tastes. The castra\u00f9re symbolise the richness of the land here.\"\nHe prepares three castra\u00f9re dishes: a silky, gently saut\u00e9ed version that doesn't just melt on the tongue but entirely disappears, leaving a subtly sweet aftertaste; tagliolini in a velvety artichoke sauce; and raw shavings of the vegetable in a salad with oil, parmesan and a hint of lemon zest. He watches my face as I take a bite of the salad and grins at my expression of surprise at the tiny bud's powerful taste. Its flavour instantly takes me back to da Camerino's boat and the smell of the salty lagoon air whipping past my face.\nOn Sant'Erasmo, local farmer Carlo Finotello has been working for years to crack down on the falsely labelled castra\u00f9re that appear in markets and shops across the lagoon. He runs the farm I Sapori di Sant'Erasmo with his brother Claudio and is also the president of the Consorzio del Carciofo Violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a consortium created in 2004 to promote the local violet artichoke. Its label is a mark of quality and authenticity.\n\"Some vegetable sellers take the consorzio label and stick it on other crates of normal artichokes,\" Finotello explained. \"Or they will buy some castra\u00f9re but then mix them in with normal artichokes so they're still making a bit extra.\"\nWhen the consortium receives a tip-off about producers passing off Tuscan artichokes as the Sant'Erasmo version, Finotello contacts them directly to ask them to desist \u2013 but the consortium isn't a policeman, he says, and they have no power to issue fines, nor the time or money to take them to court. He says that it's vital to only buy castra\u00f9re from a local producer, and to always make sure that they have the consortium's label, in order to protect the centuries-old tradition of growing them.\nMore like this:\n \u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n \u2022\u00a0The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'\n \u2022\u00a0Where to savour Rome's hidden Jewish food\nI visit Finotello at his farm to see him harvest the castra\u00f9re. It's a muggy day with a hot, salty breeze, and the earth is springy after days of rain. The artichoke plants are slowly opening up in the sun. Finotello shows me how to cut a castra\u00f9ra gently off the stalk with the traditional curved knife, which he holsters in the pocket of his overalls between rows. The plants used to be fertilised with scoasse (garbage in Venetian dialect), a mix of fish bones and old crab shells. \"We can't do that anymore because there's too much plastic in the food system,\" Finotello tells me, shrugging. \"We'd just be feeding the plants plastic.\"\nWhen he finishes harvesting the small field, he counts how many castra\u00f9re he picked: 105. He then dumps the basket in the back of his trailer and looks at me, grinning. \"Now you need to eat some.\"\nAt the farmhouse, his mother, Mirella Bubacco, is holding court in a kitchen busy with the detritus of the recent Italian Easter celebration: chocolate eggs and endless cups of espresso next to slices of colomba, a type of Italian Easter cake. Mirella is warm, businesslike \u2013 and very chatty.\n\"Don't ever eat it as an antipasto!\" she warns me, a paring knife in one hand. \"The taste lingers in your mouth, and it'll alter the taste of your first course.\" She insists that it is best eaten in the very simple Venetian style: uncooked, julienned, with a ribbon of light-tasting olive oil, a bit of salt and shavings of Grana Padano. \"The earth here on Sant'Erasmo is all the condiment you need!\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \n\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. \n",

        "article_text": "The government has been urged to take action after research found more than half of London's short-term holiday let properties are being rented out unlawfully.\nA report by Central London Forward, a partnership of inner city boroughs, revealed more than 50% of the 117,000 short-term lets listed across the capital in 2024 were booked for more than 90 days a year, in breach of regulations.\nWestminster City Council leader Adam Hug said: \"This concentration has a profound effect on our local communities.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"We will introduce a short-term let registration scheme to reap the benefits of a thriving tourist economy while protecting the spirit of our communities.\"\nLandlords cannot legally rent out their homes in the capital for more than 90 nights a year under regulations.\nThey are only allowed to let their homes out for more than 90 nights a year, on short-term lets, if they receive planning permission from the council.\nSpeaking at the Centre for London think tank's annual housing summit on Wednesday, Mr Hug said his borough was \"at the epicentre of the problem\", with short-term lets concentrated in \"the West End, Bayswater, Lancaster Gate and parts of Pimlico\".\nHe added: \"It can hollow out long-term residents, making neighbours subject to significant noise disruption, fly-tipped waste linked to short-term let properties.\n\"But it also impacts the council services which have to pick up the waste, respond to the noise complaints and deal with pressure in the local housing market, as we see private rents rise year on year.\"\nCentral London Forward's report, seen by the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), found the number of short-term lets in London has risen over the last decade. \nIn 2015, there were fewer than 30,000 short-term lets in London, which more than doubled throughout 2016 to 60,000, peaking at over 100,000 in 2019.\nThe numbers of short-term lets then \"fell dramatically\" in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, before making a \"steady recovery,\" the report added.\nThe report calls on ministers to force short-term let rental websites \"to share individualised, unit-level data with local authorities and the government\" and to introduce a mandatory national registration scheme for the sector.\n\"At the moment, it isn't possible for local authorities to effectively, at scale, enforce the existing regulations,\" said Mr Hug.\nHe added that holiday let websites will often \"mask where the properties are, putting it on a street a couple of roads away, and not being clear what building it's in\".\nThe Labour councillor added: \"It means that hard-pressed planning enforcement teams are really struggling to build the evidence base to get the court to enforce the 90-day rule.\n\"In order to better regulate the market, and to empower local authorities, we really do need national government to step up.\"\nThe report was endorsed by Tom Copley, Sir Sadiq Khan's deputy mayor for housing, who said with 65,000 homeless households in London living in temporary accommodation, \"we need to bring those properties back into use as long-term rented properties, or long-term properties for people to buy and live in as owner-occupiers\".\nA government spokesman told the LDRS the short-term let sector has seen rapid growth in recent years. \nThey said: \"This can bring economic benefits to the economy and tourism industry, but we know that having excessive concentrations of short-term lets in an area can drive up housing costs and harm local communities.\n\"That's why we have abolished the furnished holiday lets tax regime so that landlords are no longer incentivised by the tax system to rent homes as holiday lets. \n\"We continue to consider further action.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

'Completely inadequate'The report calls on ministers to force short-term let rental websites \"to share individualised, unit-level data with local authorities and the government\" and to introduce a mandatory national registration scheme for the sector. \"The report was endorsed by Tom Copley, Sir Sadiq Khan's deputy mayor for housing, who said with 65,000 homeless households in London living in temporary accommodation, \"we need to bring those properties back into use as long-term rented properties, or long-term properties for people to buy and live in as owner-occupiers\".A government spokesman told the LDRS the short-term let sector has seen rapid growth in recent years.",

She was studying it, and then said 'it's OK dad, I don't think they can see me crying'.\n\"That's all she was worried about.\"\nRory McIlroy beat Justin Rose in a dramatic play-off to win the Masters in April\nFor years, McIlroy had faced questions over whether he could complete the career Grand Slam.\nThere had been missed opportunities to claim the iconic green jacket - most notably after an infamous final-round collapse in 2011. \nDespite his talent and self belief, the 35-year-old admitted to wondering if he had missed his opportunity.\n\"You start to think if it is ever going to be your time,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a good message in there about never giving up and keep coming back. \n\"Be strong, be resilient and that patience paid off.\"\nThe Northern Irishman held a two-shot lead going into the final round, and said he had learnt lessons from his 2011 collapse, when he let a four-stroke advantage slip away.\n\"I wanted to make everything else irrelevant. I'm not going to look at what my playing partner is doing, I'm not going to look at the leaderboard. \n\"I was going to try and get in my own world. If I can shoot four-under-par, I'm going to win the Masters. \n\"I felt like I lost the Masters in 2011 because I started to look around and started to do maths in my head.\n\"If you give yourself a target and objective, that's all you can do.\"\nSir Elton John wanted to congratulate McIlroy on his Masters success - but he doesn't have a mobile phone\nUnsurprisingly, McIlroy has been contacted by famous people from all walks of life since his win at Augusta.\nHe said he was \"super humbled\" by those who had been in touch, but one famous musician stood out.\nSir Elton John needs little introduction - but there was one little problem.\n\"I actually haven't been able to connect with him yet. His assistant left me a voicemail and said Sir Elton would love to congratulate me in person.\n\"The only problem is he doesn't have a cell phone. They said I might get a call from Windsor in England on a landline, and I was like 'sure!'.\n\"I didn't even know that Elton John knew what golf was, so it's been really cool.\"\nTiger Woods, one of the five other players to complete the Grand Slam, had a simple but very cool message for McIlroy.\n\"Welcome to the club, kid.\"\nMcIlroy and Fallon recreated the famous clip of the golfer when he was eight years old by chipping balls into a washing machine\nMcIlroy's first appearance on a chat show wasn't in the glitz and glamour of New York, but a local TV programme in his native Northern Ireland. \nWhen he was just eight years of age, McIlroy showcased his talents by chipping balls into a washing machine on 'Kelly', replicating what he used to do in his kitchen in Holywood. \nHe recreated that moment with Fallon in a race to three successful chips. The pressure was on, as he had the famous green jacket on. \n\"As the Masters champion I absolutely should not lose to you!\" McIlroy quipped.\nThankfully for McIlroy, he delivered but, in his own words, \"I was better when I was eight!\".\nRory McIlroy is set to make an appearance alongside Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore 2\nHappy Gilmore is one of the most famous sports movies from the 1990s, and is set for a modern-day sequel that will come out later this year. \nIt's a story about an ice hockey player - played by Adam Sandler - who goes on to become the best golfer in the world despite his unique technique and temperament. \nMcIlroy said he was a huge fan of the original, and is set to make a cameo appearance in the upcoming release. \n\"Happy Gilmore was the golf movie for me growing up, I can recite almost every line,\" McIlroy said.\n\"The fact I got the opportunity to do that was awesome and Sandler is the absolute best.\n\"But I'm a much better golfer than I am an actor.\" ",

        "article_text": "Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau won two of last year's four majors\nNeither victory came against the strongest of fields, but Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau have signalled that Rory McIlroy is not the only player riding high as golf races towards the second men's major of the year.\nScheffler put on a masterclass with his 31 under par wire-to-wire victory, by eight strokes, over Erik van Rooyen at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. In so doing, the world number one emphatically reminded us of his status at the top of the rankings.\nDeChambeau, meanwhile, silenced a growing number of questions surrounding his apparent inability to close out tournaments. By holding off a charging Charles Howell III at LIV's Korea event, the American posted his first victory since winning last year's US Open.\nScheffler claims emphatic first win of year\nDeChambeau ends tough run with first 2025 LIV win\nScheffler - who pipped Dechambeau to finish fourth behind McIlroy at the Masters - was utterly dominant in his hometown tournament last week, posting rounds of 61, 63, 66 and 63. His aggregate of 253 at TPC Craig Ranch equalled the PGA Tour record.\nIn claiming his 14th tour victory, the 28-year-old Texan was top in no fewer than 14 statistical categories. They included, strokes gained tee to green and approach, putting average, total birdies and scoring average on par three, four and five holes.\nScheffler was the complete package while securing his first win of 2025. It came in his final outing before the next major, the US PGA Championship which starts on 15 May.\nEverything points to a determined response to McIlroy's feat of completing his full set of major titles when he succeeded Scheffler as Masters champion last month.\n\"I think we're all fired up to come out here and compete,\" Scheffler said.\n\"This week I was the best player. I have the week off, and we'll see the week after who is the best player at the PGA.\n\"Rory has been playing some tremendous golf this year. The career Grand Slam was really special to watch. I was glad to be able to be there for it.\n\"I think any time you're getting beat, you're always fired up just a little bit extra to go out and practice. I feel like my game is trending in a good direction. I'm excited to start the rest of the season.\"\nDeChambeau, who faded when playing in the final group with McIlroy at Augusta three weeks ago, must be feeling similarly bullish. Closing round failures were beginning to pile up, not just with his 75 to finish tied fifth at Augusta.\nThe 31-year-old squandered opportunities at Doral in early April and again last week at the LIV event in Mexico. The strength of the 54-hole, limited field breakaway tour is often questioned, but winning is a handy habit regardless.\nAnd DeChambeau has proved his major credentials while playing LIV's limited schedule. He was a close runner-up to Xander Schauffele at last year's US PGA, before overhauling a faltering McIlroy to win the US Open at Pinehurst last June.\n\"There's a lot of star-studded talent out there right now that's going to be in the PGA Championship,\" DeChambeau observed. \"We're going to be battling it out.\"\nThe Texas-based Californian added: \"There's a lot more work to be done this year. There are three more majors, and my eyes are focused on that with all the other LIV events, doing my absolute best in every single event I show up to.\"\nDeChambeau, Scheffler and McIlroy all being on song as the calendar moves into the meat of the major season is exciting for the sport, to say the least.\nWe should perhaps also be wondering about another career Grand Slam being completed. Jordan Spieth closed with a bogey-free 62 at the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his lowest round for four years.\nStill only 31, the Dallas native is starting to look more like his old self, having recovered from wrist surgery last year. \"My mechanics are just getting a little bit better each week,\" he said.\n\"I'm able to do sufficient stuff maybe that I wasn't able to do last year.\"\nThe 2015 Masters and US Open winner has not added to his major tally since winning the Open eight years ago. Victory at the US PGA would complete his set and put him alongside McIlroy in the Grand Slam club.\nSpieth has cause for confidence, but also knows he will be facing the most talented pros in the hottest of form. It also means this month's major gathering at Quail Hollow is becoming an increasingly enticing prospect.",

        "article_text": "The top US health department plans to require placebo testing for all vaccines in an effort to offer \"straightforward\" public health information, but experts say such testing could limit availability and raise ethical concerns. \nIn a statement first given to the Washington Post, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said this week, \"All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure \u2014 a radical departure from past practices\". \nThe agency did not provide details on which \"new vaccines\" would be included. \nBut officials have suggested that updated Covid-19 shots may be included, which vaccine experts say could slow down vaccine access.  \nPeter Lurie, a former official with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said \"it's hard to tell exactly what is being proposed.\"  \n\"But, broadly, if they mean that every modification to an existing vaccine would require a new placebo-controlled trial, they are treading in ethically dubious territory and likely to deny Americans life-saving vaccines at some point.\"\nHHS has not offered details on the timing of the placebo plan or specify the vaccines involved. \nAn HHS spokesperson told the BBC in a statement that health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's goal of \"radical transparency\" means being \"honest and straightforward about what we know \u2014 and what we don't know \u2014 about medical products, including vaccines\". \nThe statement said none of the childhood vaccines recommended in the US  - except the Covid shot - had undergone \"inert placebo\" testing, meaning \"we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products\". \nBut public health experts say the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including ones for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio and the mumps, were all initially tested against a placebo. In fact, all new immunizations already go through the trials - a type of random testing where one test group receives the immunization, and the other gets a placebo, like a saline shot. \nBut newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process, because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group, and because the shot is only being tweaked in a minor way, vaccine experts said. \nThe coronavirus shot, for example, already has gone through rigorous safety testing, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\"We have a lot of information about the safety of the vaccine,\" he said. \"All we're doing this year is using a different Omicron variant that we used last year and the year before that.\" \nStill, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said this week that the agency was \"taking a look\" at updated coronavirus shots, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News that there is a \"void of data\". \nAn HHS spokesperson told the BBC that \"significant updates to existing vaccines\" may be considered \"new products\" requiring additional clinical evaluation.\n\"A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years,\" the spokesperson said. \nRequiring companies to conduct placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly - and the drug makers could ultimately decide to forgo making the newer, more effective versions of the vaccine altogether, said Dr Lurie.\nBefore taking office - and since assuming the role as secretary - Kennedy has spread   false claims about vaccine safety. His tenure has coincided with one of the worst measles outbreaks in a decade; two children have died and 660 people have been infected in Texas. \nThis week, he encouraged parents to \"do their own research\" about the measles vaccine - which has been considered safe and 97% effective for decades - and raised questions about whether the shot could cause seizures or neurological issues. \nFor months, he has at times endorsed the MMR shot, and at other times, called it a \"personal\" decision. Kennedy also promoted alternative treatments, which doctors say patients should not use without medical supervision. ",

        "article_text": "The trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of the most successful rappers and music moguls in the US, starts in New York with jury selection on Monday. \nThe charges against him include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\nThe rapper also faces dozens of civil lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.\nMr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".\nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.\nHis early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or The Notorious B.I.G.\nHis music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\nMr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand C\u00eeroc.\nIn 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.\nIn the federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nMany of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.\nIt includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, dozens of people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss one part of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nIn a hearing in New York a week before the trial, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal. \nThey said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers. \nAt the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal. \nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on Monday.\nThe first days of the trial will consist of jury selection, with the trial starting in earnest after the panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is selected. \nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial will take place in front of US District Judge Arun Subramanian at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.\nThe trial is expected to be open to the public, but won't be streamed online.\nCameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.\n\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.\nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.\nTransportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",

        "article_text": "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.\nAnimals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.\nBut a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.\nIt has been moved to Germany's Black Forest where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.\nThis week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.\nTwo days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.\n\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"\nThousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.  \nThough not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food. \nOnce native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction. \n\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.\nIt was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx. \nThe lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring. \n\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.\nTo combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind. \nBut last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.\nSo Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.\n\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo. \nOver the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.\n\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.\nWe're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.\nThere are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.\n\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.\nThe key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.\n\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure. \n\"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\"\nThe final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring. \n",

All three deny the allegations.\nUS prosecutors allege the men used force, fraud and coercion to make young men, many of whom were aspiring models, engage in violent and exploitative sex acts while Mr Jeffries was chief executive from at least 2008 until 2015.\nThe charges followed a 2023 BBC documentary and ongoing podcast series that revealed the three of them benefited from a sophisticated operation in which recruiters scouted young men for sex in cities including London, New York, Paris and Marrakesh.\nThe BBC has since revealed that more than 40 men, including Abercrombie & Fitch employees, have now come forward with civil allegations of sexual assault, drugging or rape - with claims dating back to 1992, the year Mr Jeffries started running the company.\nCivil trial lawyers have told the BBC their clients are dismayed at the criminal court's decision that Mr Jeffries is unfit to stand trial.\n\"We've been speaking with our clients who are disappointed by the decision and still want justice,\" said Brad Edwards and Brittany Henderson, representing 26 alleged victims.\nBrian Bieber, Mr Jeffries' criminal defence lawyer, said his client had recently been evaluated by doctors who determined he had Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body disease, and the residual effects of a traumatic brain injury requiring around-the-clock care, which \"will almost certainly worsen over time\".\nDr Cheryl Paradis, the US prosecutor's medical expert, also independently assessed Mr Jeffries. According to court papers, she found he was unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to properly assist in his defence.\n\"His memory impairment almost certainly would cause him to be unable to accurately recall key events and details,\" Dr Paradis said, according to the court filings, \"and severely limit his capacity to provide accurate and reliable information\".\nShe added: \"Additionally, his inappropriate behaviour, which is a symptom of his dementia, could further interfere with his ability to maintain proper courtroom demeanour. He may blurt out self-incriminating statements or engage in erratic behaviour, which would undermine his credibility.\"\nThe BBC understands that Mr Jacobson and Mr Smith could still face trial on the same sex-trafficking and prostitution charges.\nAlongside criminal charges, Mr Jeffries and his partner Mr Smith have been defending multiple civil lawsuits accusing them of rape, sex trafficking and assault, which they \"vehemently deny\".\nThe civil lawsuits had been stayed - or legally put on pause - until the resolution of the criminal case, which takes precedence to protect Mr Jeffries' right against self-incrimination.\nWhile his criminal case remains uncertain, Mr Jeffries could still face a civil trial or reach a settlement over the allegations. If this was the case, the outcome could lead to compensation being awarded to alleged victims.\n\"Mike Jeffries attacked these men and ruined their lives at a point when they were at their most vulnerable and chasing their dreams,\" said civil case lawyer, Brad Edwards.\n\"He will still be held accountable by our lawsuit and his co-conspirators will still face the criminal justice system.\n\"For anyone affected still in fear about coming forward, you should be reassured that his power is now totally gone\".\nAbercrombie & Fitch is also being sued for negligence, with lawsuits claiming that it knowingly facilitated \"heinous sexual crimes\".\nThe company - which also owns the Hollister brand - has previously said it was \"appalled and disgusted\" by Mr Jeffries' alleged behaviour.",

The captain of the flotilla ship can clearly be heard reporting drone strikes and a fire onboard.\nThe Maltese government said everyone aboard the ship was \"confirmed safe\" and that a fire onboard the ship was \"brought under control overnight\".\nThe Freedom Flotilla Coalition said it had planned to sail to Gaza with people including climate activist Greta Thunberg on board and \"challenge Israel's illegal siege and blockade\".\nThe NGO called for Israeli ambassadors to be summoned to answer for \"violation of international law, including the ongoing blockade and the bombing of our civilian vessel\".\nThe Israeli military said it was looking into reports of the attack.\nOrganisers told the BBC that the group had been \"operating in total secrecy with a complete media blackout\" to prevent \"sabotage\" as they prepared to sail towards Gaza - where about two million Palestinians have been under a complete blockade by the Israeli military for two months.\nVolunteer Surya McEwen said he and others had lost contact with the ship after the incident, which he said caused a fire on board and damaged the hull. They had since been told there were no major injuries.\n\"It's a full-on situation for them but they're recovering,\" he told the BBC, adding that the incident had been an \"unprovoked attack on a civilian vessel in international waters, trying to do a humanitarian mission\".\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg was among those who had planned to board the ship once it departed for Gaza on Friday.  \nSpeaking to journalists in Valetta, she said: \"I was part of the group who was supposed to board that boat today to continue the voyage towards Gaza, which is one of many attempts to open up a humanitarian corridor and to do our part to keep trying to break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza.\"\nThunberg added that as far as she's aware, the ship is still at the location of the attack because moving it would let too much water in.\n\"What is certain is that we human rights activists will continue to do everything in our power to do our part, to demand a free Palestine and demand the opening of a humanitarian corridor,\" she said.\nThe Maltese government said that 12 crew and four activists were on board the boat, while the NGO said 30 activists had been on board.\nThe Freedom Flotilla Coalition uploaded a video showing a fire on the ship. It said the attack appeared to have targeted the generator, which left the ship without power and at risk of sinking. \nThe Maltese government said a tugboat was sent to the scene to extinguish the fire, which they say was under control by 01:28 local time.\n\"By 2:13, all crew were confirmed safe but refused to board the tug,\" the statement said, adding the ship remains outside territorial waters.\nCyprus responded to the SOS signal by dispatching a vessel, the activists said, but that it did not \"provide the critical electrical support needed\". \nMarine tracking software shows that the Conscience left Tunisia on Tuesday evening and is currently around 12-14 nautical miles off Malta.\nThe coalition is campaigning to end Israel's blockade of Gaza, which is also facing mounting international condemnation. Last month the UK, French and German foreign ministers described the Israeli decision to block aid as \"intolerable\".\nTwo months ago, Israel shut all crossings to Gaza \u2013 preventing all goods, including food, fuel and medicines from entering - and later resumed its military offensive, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. \nSome humanitarian organisations such as the World Food Programme say they have already run out of food while community kitchens say their stocks are dwindling fast. On Friday the Red Cross said the humanitarian response in Gaza was on the verge of \"total collapse\".\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 52,418 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nAdditional reporting by Tom Bateman, Alice Cuddy and BBC Verify",

        "article_text": "Invented to satiate pregnancy cravings, Dubai chocolate is a rare combination of creativity, flavours and social media success that has broken all industry records.\nIt was a cold, damp evening in Munich in December 2024, but the festive tunes and the twinkling fairy lights at the Marienplatz Christkindlmarkt (Christmas market) lifted my spirits. With a mug of gl\u00fchwein (hot mulled wine) in hand, I made my way to the candy stall to get my usual supply of German Christmas cookies. But I stopped in my tracks when I realised that the longest queue was not for lebkuchen (gingerbread biscuits baked for Christmas) or the traditional stollen fruit bread, but for a new kid on the block: Dubai chocolate.\nThat was my first encounter with the viral chocolate in a land far from its birthplace. But by then, Dubai chocolate had already become a global sensation: a rich, sticky and unapologetically extra chocolate bar that had shattered industry records, won millions of hearts and was spreading like wildfire across the world.\nA decadent milk chocolate bar filled with silky pistachio cream, earthy tahini and crunchy shards of knafeh pastry, the original Dubai chocolate was launched by Dubai-based FIX Dessert Chocolatier in 2022 when its British Egyptian founder, Sarah Hamouda, had an urge to create something unique to satisfy her pregnancy cravings for knafeh and pistachio. FIX called their creation \"Can't Get Knafeh Of It\".\nCan't Get Knafeh Of It took the world by storm when TikTok influencer Maria Vehera posted a rapturous video of herself trying the chocolate bar inside her car in December 2023. The video quickly went viral, attracting more than 125 million views and scores of fans around the world who were willing to do anything to grab a bite. The bar became a craze and was promptly christened \"Dubai chocolate\".\nIn an interview with the BBC earlier this year, Yezen Alani, co-founder of FIX, described the international spotlight as \"flattering and humbling\". However, despite FIX's plans for global expansion, its Can't Get Knafeh Of It bar remains solely available in the UAE, pushing independent chocolatiers and multinational brands such as Lindt and \u00dclker to mimic the original and produce their own versions to meet global demand. These imitations, also known as \"Dubai chocolate\", have inundated supermarkets and neighbourhood bodegas all over the world.\nToday, Dubai chocolate can be found everywhere, from the online shelves of UAE's food delivery apps and the brimming counters of Istanbul's sweet shops to the packed aisles of London's Lidl stores and the chaotic alleyways of Mumbai's flea markets. Global demand continues to skyrocket, resulting in worldwide stockouts and an international pistachio shortage. It has spawned waitlists at chocolate counters across Europe and the United States and inspired limited-edition collaborations with major brands like Shake Shack and Starbucks. Supermarkets have begun rationing Dubai chocolate, and people have been caught smuggling the prized bars. In short, the Dubai chocolate craze has shaken the global chocolate industry.\nThis has opened up a whole new market for artisan confectioners worldwide, including the renowned Maison Samadi in London. Maison Samadi, one of the UK's oldest chocolatiers with roots in Lebanon, was the first to introduce their version of the viral Dubai chocolate bars, named \"Dubai Viral Style Chocolate\" in London. For Nabil Chehab, business development director at Maison Samadi, making Dubai Viral Style Chocolate was a natural segue in their chocolate-making journey. \"We were already working on our heritage collection when we discovered the viral Dubai chocolate. It fitted perfectly because it combined a beloved Middle Eastern dessert, the knafeh, which was a tribute to the Samadi family heritage, with chocolate, our core expertise,\" says Chehab.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nChehab tells me that the demand for their Dubai Viral Style Chocolate bars has far exceeded their expectations, likely due to the interesting concept behind it. \"It's remarkable how the FIX team came up with this innovative idea of having a 'dessert in a chocolate bar' that has now become more enjoyable and satisfying than just a regular chocolate bar,\" enthuses Chehab. For centuries, food lovers have relished knafeh on its own. Now, Dubai chocolate allows them to sample this well-known dessert inside a chocolate shell, making the experience even more intriguing and exciting.\u00a0\n\"The real success of Dubai chocolate stems from its texture,\" agrees leading Turkish food writer Aylin \u00d6ney Tan. \"The velvety gooeyness of the pistachio cream doesn't just feel good on your palate; it is also visually attractive. Additionally, the crunchy texture of the kadayif pastry from the knafeh makes the dessert even more irresistible.\"\n\"Chocolates with a palpable crunch, such as Swiss Toblerone and Ferrero Rocher, have always done well in the market,\" explains \u00d6ney Tan. \"Same with Dubai chocolate. Only in this case, the crunch goes an extra mile and primes the chocolate bar for social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\" As Vehera bites into the paint-splattered chocolate bar in her TikTok video, decadent pistachio cream oozes out and crunchy ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) sounds fill the foreground, making it a clear social media winner.\nHowever, \"although Dubai chocolate's instant growth has been fuelled largely by social media, the exclusivity of the original bar has kept the interest going,\" says Monique Naval, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International. The original Can't Get Knafeh Of It bar is only available online at 14:00 and 17:00 through online food delivery app Deliveroo in the UAE. FIX produces around 500 bars every day, and they sell out fast. The limited availability, both temporal and geographical, creates a fear of missing out, further increasing interest and demand.\n\"Having Dubai in the name also adds to the chocolate's popularity and hype,\" says Naval. When people think of Dubai, they think of lavish hotels, glitzy malls, luxurious cars and gold-dusted desserts. Similar \"feelings of indulgence drive the success of Dubai chocolate,\" she adds.\nBeyond its viral fame, Dubai chocolate's resonance also lies in its deep Middle Eastern roots \u2013 tapping into family traditions of sharing sweets, gifting edible treats and the nostalgic flavours of knafeh and pistachios woven into daily life across the region.\nFor Chehab, the connection runs deep.\n\"When my wife's great-grandfather, Muhieddine Samadi, started Al Samadi Sweets in Beirut in 1872, knafeh was one of the first sweets he ever sold,\" he reminisces. \"I grew up in Beirut. As a kid, I remember taking the famous Lebanese shared taxi to Al Samadi Sweets daily, picking up a plate of knafeh for breakfast and eating it on my way to my father's shop. Little did I know [at that time] that I would be marrying Samadi's lovely great-granddaughter,\" he adds, with a twinkle in his eyes.\nIn an interview with Arabian Business last year, Hamouda said, \"I wanted the FIX experience to be different. I wanted people, from that first bite, to relive moments of their past.\" And for many fans around the world, that first bite delivers exactly what Hamouda intended: an edible journey back to bustling Middle Eastern souks, where merchants sell delicious local sweets and the air is dense with the aroma of pistachios.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n \u2022\u00a0The baffling purple honey found only in North Carolina\n \u2022 The world's true cradle of chocolate\n \u2022\u00a0A beauty mogul's guide to luxury self-care in Dubai\n\"Sixty-eight percent of the world's consumers want to experience cultures other than their own and that includes a willingness and desire to try new flavours and ingredients,\" explains Naval. Pistachios \u2013 a Middle Eastern staple \u2013 are riding this wave too, billed as the next big seasonal flavour globally, and appearing in everything from lattes to liqueurs.\nAt the same time, Middle Eastern tourism is booming and Dubai has emerged as a culinary destination in its own right, with some visitors flying in just to taste the viral chocolate firsthand. What began as a simple chocolate bar in a Dubai dessert shop has evolved into a global sensation.\n\"I am not surprised,\" says Chehab, reflecting on the chocolate's meteoric rise. \"It is the perfect amalgamation of taste, texture, indulgence and nostalgia. It was born to be a champion.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. \n",

The latter emphasising his desire to call it a day.\nIt is unlikely Smith's former captain Barry Ferguson will want Sunday to be his last taste of a fixture that means everything in Glasgow but counts for little on this occasion.\nCeltic's latest title success, their 13th in 14 seasons, has left a bitter taste in Ferguson's mouth as the interim head coach prepares for what may be his final game against the champions, with the Ibrox club's incoming paymasters expected to make sweeping changes.\nAs a former Rangers skipper, Ferguson knows the fixture inside out, having made his derby debut in the midfield boiler room alongside Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Jorg Albertz in 1998. He knows what wins over their neighbours can do when it comes to longevity in the post.\nBut, despite ending an almost five-year wait for a victory at Celtic Park the last time they locked horns, Ferguson's short stint in the hotseat looks to be coming to an end with inauspicious results elsewhere and an inability to win at home.\nPutting it up to Celtic has not been Rangers' problem in recent months.\nThey have won the past two derbies and were a penalty shootout away from winning the League Cup against Brendan Rodgers' side in December.\nThey have scored three goals in three successive games against their old rivals for the first time since 2002 and are chasing a third straight win over them in the same season for the first time since 1996-97.\nAnd yet it feels like Rangers are as far behind Celtic as they've ever been.\nGoals have rained in on them and points have been shed against the other Premiership sides with staggering regularity.\nRangers have only scored once in their previous six games at Ibrox and equally staggering is the fact they have conceded at least twice in 11 of their past 13 overall.\nWhat chances a Rangers guard of honour for Celtic?\nCeltic's Jota ruled out for up to nine months\nCeltic's Scottish league dominance in numbers\nFor Rodgers and his team, there will be a determination, if not a desperation, to come out on top.\nYes, the title has been wrapped up with ease yet again. But those two defeats to Rangers will irk the Celtic boss. There was a time when the outcome of these games indicated where the title was going, that has not been the case this term.\nRodgers' Old Firm record still stands above all others and that is something he will want to maintain.\nHe likes to have records in mind as he goes along and one still to achieve is beating the 106 goals his invincible side scored in 2016-17 during his maiden season at Parkhead. Celtic are five away from achieving that having scored five in each of their past three matches.\nHaving secured honour number 11 as Celtic boss, Rodgers has moved himself into sixth place in Scottish Football's managerial roll of honour. He now stands behind only Willie Maley, Bill Struth, Jock Stein, Smith and Scot Symon. The latter two are catchable if Rodgers plans on sticking around for the next few seasons.\nFor Ferguson, he has three more chances to register a victory at Ibrox with the club setting an unwanted benchmark of six home games without one.\nThe 47-year-old will have spent many a night since replacing Phillipe Clement wondering why this group of players can beat Celtic twice yet lose to Queen's Park, St Mirren, Motherwell and Hibernian on their own patch.\nNot all of those have come on his watch but Ferguson knows it is a level of ignominy that won't wash at Rangers and if it is to be the end of his spell in charge, he will personally want a 100% record from his games against Celtic.\nWhatever the outcome of this one, it won't register on the Richter scale but the phrase \"dead rubber\" doesn't really apply when it comes to these best of enemies.",

Trump's statement did not say whether the tariff would apply to American production companies producing films abroad.\nSeveral recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II.\nThe governments of Australia and New Zealand have spoken out in support of their countries' film industries.\n\"Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,\" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said.\nNew Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs.\n\"But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,\" he added.\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed tariffs on countries around the world.\nHe argues tariffs will boost US manufacturers and protect jobs - but the global economy has been thrown into chaos as a result, and prices on goods around the world are expected to rise.\nAhead of his inauguration, Trump appointed three film stars - Jon Voight, Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone - to be special ambassadors tasked with promoting business opportunities in Hollywood, which he described as a \"great but very troubled place\".\n\"They will serve as Special Envoys to me for the purpose of bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last four years to Foreign Countries, BACK\u2014BIGGER, BETTER, AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE!\" Trump wrote at the time.\nThe US remains a major film production hub globally despite challenges, according to movie industry research firm ProdPro.\nIts most recent annual report shows the country saw $14.54bn (\u00a310.94bn) of production spending last year. That was down by 26% since 2022, though.\nCountries that have attracted an increase in spending over the same period include Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK, according to the report.\nEven before this most recent announcement, the US movie industry had been impacted by the fallout from Trump's trade policies.\nIn April, China said it was reducing its quota of American films allowed into the country.\n\"The wrong action of the US government to abuse tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience's favourability towards American films,\" the China Film Administration said. \n\"We will follow the market rules, respect the audience's choice, and moderately reduce the number of American films imported.\"\nTrump has hit China hardest with his tariffs salvo, imposing import taxes of up to 145% on goods from there. \nHis administration said last month that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nBeijing has hit back with a 125% import duty on goods from the US.\nOther countries currently face a blanket US tariff of 10% until a pause on higher levies expires in July.\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said he was meeting with many countries, including China, on trade deals.\nHe added, however, that he had no plans to speak with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping this week - despite previous reports that Washington had approached Beijing about holding trade talks.\nAsked if any trade agreements would be announced this week, Trump said that could \"very well be\", but gave no details.\nEarlier, Trump signalled he may be willing to lower tariffs on China.\n\"At some point, I'm going to lower them, because otherwise, you could never do business with them, and they want to do business very much,\" he said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press.\nIn the same interview, Trump said he may grant another extension to a deadline for China-based ByteDance to sell the US operations of TikTok.\nHe has already given two reprieves from a law that threatens to ban the short video app if it is not sold to a non-Chinese company.\nByteDance currently has until 19 June to reach an agreement over ownership of the platform, which is used by 170 million Americans.\nNegotiations over a potential deal have stalled since Trump imposed steep new tariffs on China.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Conservatives in Canada are trading blame for Monday night's election loss, showing that Pierre Poilievre will need to heal divisions within the movement as he fights to stay on as leader.\nAs a clear Liberal win was emerging on election night, Conservative candidates and their supporters had one question: What the heck just happened?\nThe party had lost a remarkable 27-point lead in opinion polls and failed to win an election for the fourth time in a row. \nAnd while it gained seats and earned almost 42% of the popular vote - its highest share since the party was founded in 2003 - its leader Poilievre was voted out of the seat he had held for the past 20 years.\n\"Nobody's happy about that,\" Shakir Chambers, a Conservative strategist and vice-president of Ontario-based consultancy firm the Oyster Group, told the BBC.\nThe party is now trying to work out how it will move forward.\nAt the top of the agenda will be finding a way for the Conservatives to perform their duties as the Official Opposition - the second-place party in Canada's parliament whose job is to hold the sitting government to account - without their leader in the House.\nAhead of a caucus meeting next Tuesday to discuss this, Poilievre announced on Friday his plan to run in an Alberta constituency special election to win back a seat.\nThat special election will be triggered by the resignation of Conservative MP-elect Damien Kurek, who said he will voluntarily step down to let Poilievre back in after what he called \"a remarkable national campaign\".\n\"An unstoppable movement has grown under his leadership, and I know we need Pierre fighting in the House of Commons,\" Kurek said in a statement.\nUnlike the US, federal politicians in Canada do not have to live in the city or province they run in. Poilievre grew up in Alberta, however, and will likely win handily as the constituency he is running in is a Conservative stronghold.\nA big question is whether Poilievre still has the backing of his own party to stay on as leader.  Mr Chambers said the answer, so far, is a resounding yes.\n\"Pierre has a lot of support in the caucus,\" he said. \"I don't think there's anybody that wants him removed, or that has super high ambitions that wants to replace him as leader.\"\nA number of high-profile Conservatives have already rallied behind him. One of them is Andrew Scheer, a current MP and former leader of the party, who said Poilievre should stay on to \"ensure we finish the job next time\".\nOthers are casting blame on where they went wrong.\nJamil Jivani, who won his own constituency in a suburb of Toronto handily, felt that Ontario leader Doug Ford had betrayed the conservative movement and cost the party the election.\nThe federal and provincial Conservative parties are legally different entities, though they belong to the same ideological tent, and Ford is leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party.\nHe frequently made headlines during the election campaign for his get-tough attitude with Donald Trump and the US president's trade war. \n\"He couldn't stay out of our business,\" Jivani told a CBC reporter.\nJivani, who in a past life attended Yale University with US Vice-President JD Vance, where the two became good friends, accused Ford of distracting from the federal Conservatives' campaign and of \"positioning himself as some political genius that we need to be taking cues from\".\nBut Mr Chambers, the Conservative strategist, said that Poilievre will also need to confront where the party fell short.\nPoilievre, who is known for his combative political style, has struggled with being unlikeable among the general Canadian public.\nHe has also failed to shore up the support of popular Conservative leaders in some provinces, like Ontario's Ford, who did not campaign for Poilievre despite his recent landslide victory in a provincial election earlier this year. Ford did, however, post a photo of him and Liberal leader Mark Carney having a coffee.\n\"Last time I checked, Pierre Poilievre never came out in our election,\" Ford told reporters earlier this week. \"Matter of fact, he or one of his lieutenants told every one of his members, 'don't you dare go out and help'\".\n\"Isn't that ironic?\"\nAnother Conservative premier, Tim Houston of Nova Scotia - who also did not campaign for Poilievre - said the federal party needs to do some \"soul-searching\" after its loss.\n\"I think the Conservative Party of Canada was very good at pushing people away, not so good at pulling people in,\" Houston said.\nNot every premier stood on the sidelines. Poilievre was endorsed by Alberta's Danielle Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, both western Conservatives.\nKory Teneycke, Ford's campaign manager, who publicly criticised Poilievre's campaign during the election, angering federal Conservatives, rejected the notion that Ford's failure to endorse Poilievre had cost him the election.\nHe told the BBC that, to him, the bigger problem was Poilievre's failure to unite Conservative voters in Canada.\n\"What constitutes a Conservative in different parts of the country can look quite different,\" he said, adding that Poilievre's populist rhetoric and aggressive style appealed to Conservatives in the west, but alienated those in the east.\n\"There was a lot of Trump mimicry in terms of how they presented the campaign,\" Mr Teneycke said. \n\"Donald Trump is public enemy number one to most in Canada, and I don't think it was coming across very well.\"\nHe added he believes some of the \"soul-searching\" by Poilievre's Conservatives will need to include a plan of how to build a coalition of the right in a country \"as big and diverse as Canada\".\nAsked by reporters what it would take to heal the rift, Ford answered: \"All they have to do is make a phone call.\"",

        "article_text": "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.\nThe top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.\nSo much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.\nBut 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.\nBut is that accurate, or too simplistic?\nTo get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.\nBy 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.\n\"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.\n\"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\"\nSplits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.\nDepending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.\nWestern Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.\nBut people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.\nAs a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\".\n\"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me.\nCzechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\"\nRussia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.\nFor VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine \u2013 it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.\nThe official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.\nThat invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky.\n\"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\"\nThis is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.\nEurope has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.\nBut this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.\nFollowing WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.\nThe idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.\nMight we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.\n\"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.\nThe war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.\nEurope, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.\nThe televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.\nA YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.\nIn Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.\nIf Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.\nAnd with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.\nThe message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.\nThat's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.\nThe Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.\nUrsula von der Leyen, once Germany's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\"\nStill, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.\nChina, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.\nTrump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.\nWittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\".\nDespite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.\nSome also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\".\nPerhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.\nAnalysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities. \nThis is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.\nMr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.\n\"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.\n\"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.\n\"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\"\nEight decades on from the hell they experienced, surviving WW2 veterans would tell you they fervently hope that won't be the case.",

        "article_text": "A few miles from East London's perennially hip neighbourhoods, an explosion of art and culture is transforming a once-neglected stretch into one of the city's hottest destinations.\nEast London. Two words that, if you know anything about the UK's capital, often conjure up opposing opinions.\nThere are those who mourn its supposedly waning hip factor \u2013 regaling stories of 1980s warehouse art shows or squat parties \u2013 while deploring the rampant commercialism of its supercharged epicentre, Shoreditch. Others, meanwhile, will rave about new independent galleries or small-plate restaurants in nearby Dalston, Bethnal Green or Hackney. Yet, the general consensus is that East London's long-buzzing arts and food scenes are continuing to move ever further out, driven \u2013 as in other world cities \u2013 by the relentless search for affordability.\nBut a few miles east of these oversubscribed neighbourhoods are two boroughs that are lesser known to visitors and have been quietly emerging as London's next artsy enclave: Waltham Forest and Newham. Stretching north from Stratford up to Leyton and Walthamstow, this\u00a0 once-unfashionable outer area hasn't always matched East London's brand of cool. And yet in spring 2025, it's witnessing a cultural explosion, with new museums, theatres and bars and some of the city's biggest arts openings that are putting this under-the-radar corner of London on the map.\nThe catalyst for these boroughs' rise was the 2012 London Olympics, which transformed the area's scrapyards and brownfield land into the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park \u2013 an oasis of rivers, canals and water meadows bordered by Stratford, Leyton and Hackney.\n\"The Olympics brought a huge amount of investment in infrastructure, transport links and housing,\" said Britannia Morton, co-chief executive of Sadler's Wells, the world-famous Islington-based dance theatre founded in the 18th Century. \"The Olympic Park, where our new Sadler's Wells East is based, was created converting marshland into this beautiful environment.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSadler's Wells East, which opened in February 2025, is located in East Bank, a \u00a31.1bn new waterside cultural quarter in the Olympic Park. \"[It was] formerly known as Fridge Mountain \u2013 a dumping ground for old electronic appliances,\" said Morton. The first landmark to open here was the University of the Arts' London College of Fashion in October 2023, which has galleries and a cafe open to the public. Sadler's Wells East was built in Italian red brick and houses a 550-seat state-of-the-art auditorium and six dance studios.\n\"Whether you're interested in ballet, hip-hop, kathak or contemporary, our eclectic programme brings the most innovative work created locally, nationally and internationally to Stratford,\" said Morton. Visitors can enjoy free events in its public spaces, including lunchtime dance classes on the community dance floor, as well as a bar and restaurant. There are panoramic views from its rooftop over the London Aquatics Centre, Sir Anish Kapoor's 114.5m ArcelorMittal Orbit (the UK's largest sculpture) and the London Stadium.\nAcross the park at the Here East innovation and tech campus (formerly the London Olympics Media Centre) is the glass-fronted V&A East Storehouse, opening 31 May 2025. It's the first half of the new V&A East, whose South Kensington-based original is the world's largest museum of applied arts, decorative arts and design, with more than 2.8 million objects in its permanent collection.\nThis first instalment is essentially a new home for the V&A East's reserve collection (hence the name \"Storehouse\"), and \"a magical new behind-the-scenes museum experience\", according to its deputy director and COO Tim Reeve. With 100 curated mini displays, its half a million works range from the\u00a0Glastonbury Festival\u00a0Archive to Dior\u00a0haute couture and mid-century furniture. Its\u00a0world-first Order an Object experience allows anyone to book an appointment to view anything from Roman frescoes to Elton John's costumes. It will also be home to the\u00a0new David Bowie Centre, opening 13 September 2025, displaying the singer's outfits, lyrics and archive.\n\"It's a new standard for access to national collections,\" said Reeve. \"We're encouraging visitors to feel empowered to make their own journeys through the V&A's global collections.\"\nThe second half, the five-storey V&A East Museum, is opening in East Bank in spring 2026. Its main exhibition hall will celebrate leading artists, designers and performers in major shows, and its galleries will narrate stories of East London's creative and manufacturing heritage.\nElsewhere in East Bank, BBC Music Studios, which will house the BBC Symphony Orchestra and host recording sessions and live performances, is slated to open in late 2025 or early 2026.\nAnd that's not all. A couple of miles north in Walthamstow, another major cultural opening is happening. While this diverse north-east London suburb has long been thriving \u2013 its pretty village centre, some of which dates to the 15th Century, is indeed a gentrification hotspot \u2013 the imposing new Soho Theatre Walthamstow will further raise the neighbourhood's profile when it opens on 2 May 2025. A former cinema designed in 1930 by architect Cecil Masey, the distinctive building was inspired by the Moorish architecture of the 13th-Century Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. In its mid-20th-Century heyday, it also hosted gigs by The Beatles, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Dusty Springfield, Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones \u2013 before closing in 2003.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 London Overground: Four stops to explore the 'real' London\n\u2022 Five unusual historical experiences in London\n\u2022 See another side to London at eight of its most unusual tourist attractions\nWhen it finally reopens, with its original Art Deco stylings revived, the Soho Theatre Walthamstow will have a 960-seat Grade II-listed auditorium, studio spaces, four bars and a restaurant. (In comparison, its current West End location has a capacity of just 240.)\n\"This is the first time we've had a professional theatre in the area,\" said executive assistant Annie Jones, who worked on the restoration project for more than five years. \"The programme will list up to nine shows a night \u2013 a mix of comedy, cabaret and theatre all rooted in its community. Waltham Forest has always been welcoming, with its vibrancy, multiculturalism and openness, and its\u00a0spirit has only\u00a0grown.\"\nConnecting Stratford, the Olympic Park and Walthamstow is Leyton. This once-maligned area is now home to one of the most up-and-coming strips in East London. Previously more synonymous with fly-tipping, Tilbury Road railway arches (a narrow alleyway opposite Leyton Midland Road station) has been transformed by new arrivals in the last year alone, including three bars, a bakery, a Caribbean restaurant and two soon-to-open artisan cafes. The opening of two popular microbreweries in the last few years on the same stretch sparked this sudden transformation: Gravity Well, nestled in the station arch itself, and the edgier Libertalia taproom, named after a mythical anarchist colony in the 17th Century.\nFor Leyton-raised Danny Saunders, owner of tropical cocktail bar Leyton Calling (which opened in summer 2024) and cosy candlelit pub Chop Shop Tavern (which opened in February 2025), it's a personal coup, having known the area since the 1980s. \"I've come full circle,\" he said, with a smile. \"My latest bar is in the actual arch where I set up my first car repair business back in the day.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLeyton's rise as a whole has, however, been something of a slow-burn. Back in the mid-2010s, nearby Francis Road began to be taken over by independent creative businesses. \"I opened here in 2017,\" said Aim\u00e9e Madill, who owns Phlox, a bookstore, cafe and wine bar. \"It was risky as it was still a 'less-developed' part of London, but local indie bookshops are more than a business, they're a sign of confidence in a community.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nPedestrianised in 2017, the tree-lined street has since blossomed with chic cafes and bars: two of the latest openings are vinyl store-cum-craft beer bar Dreamhouse Records and Loop Dining, a pop-up space launched in summer 2024 to host weekly residencies from buzzy up-and-coming chefs.\n\"Unlike Stratford,\" Madill said,\u00a0\"Leyton is characterised\u00a0by small makers and creatives existing side by side with businesses who've been here decades. Most of us live here, so we've been able to revitalise, rather than reinvent, parts of the area \u2013 which adds to the sense of community.\"\nSo what's next for outer East London? \"Young people and families are now priced out of Hackney,\" said Michaela Zelenanska, who runs natural wine bar Swirl, which opened in December 2024 on Tilbury Road. \"Leyton and neighbouring Leytonstone seem a logical next big thing. It's small businesses that make the place what it is.\"\nWill London continue to move ever further east? \"We're already engaging with artists, audiences and community groups in Barking and Dagenham,\" said Morton, referencing two outer London suburbs several miles from Leyton and Stratford. \"East London has always been a creative crucible.\"\nStephen Emms is an East London resident who writes a weekly newsletter called Leytonstoner about the arts, food and drink scenes primarily in Leyton, Leytonstone, Stratford and Walthamstow.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Rangers have performed well against Celtic but slipped up far too often to challenge their old rivals for the Scottish Premiership crown\nThe angst of a football manager's life was writ large over Barry Ferguson's contorted frame in the dying seconds of the last Old Firm derby of the season.\nA Rangers throw-in down the Celtic end and an opportunity for James Tavernier to hurl one towards the box in the hope of something happening to turn a 1-1 draw into a win.\nInstead, Hamza Igamane gets it and flings it back towards his own goal, whereupon Rangers are mugged and Celtic are away. Daizen Maeda, their principal goalscorer all season, is scampering into the Rangers penalty area - and Ferguson is practically jumping out of his own skin in frustration.\nGesticulating madly, he's like a man who's been given electric shock treatment. From the gantry up above, you could almost feel his pain.\nCeltic blew that moment, of course, but in real time you'd have bet money on Maeda picking out Johnny Kenny for a fairly routine tap-in winner. \nAt least Ferguson and the Rangers fans were spared that misery and the industrial-scale mocking that would have followed. The smallest mercy towards the end of a largely merciless season.\nFerguson retains hope of keeping Rangers head coach role\nRangers condemn 'unacceptable' banner and throwing of bottle\nIdah's Celtic equaliser leaves Rangers without home win in seven\nIn the wake of Philippe Clement's demise, Ferguson and his coaches - Billy Dodds, Neil McCann and Allan McGregor - were sent into Ibrox as some kind of survival experts, but it hasn't worked. Too many ills, too much damage done before they arrived, too little time to work on a solution.\nYou sense Ferguson has dedicated all his waking hours to this cause, that he's emptied himself into the role with abandon. He's spoken brilliantly, he's sent out all the right messages, he's practically tattooed the word BELIEVE on his forehead in an attempt to drag his players out their torpor.\nIt's not been enough to address the bizarre contradictions at the heart of this team, a gang of players with a twin personality; confident and dangerous against good teams, afflicted by uncertainty and impotence against supposedly inferior opposition.\nRangers have gone away to Fenerbahce and won a Europa League match but have been knocked out of the Scottish Cup by Queen's Park, the eighth-best team in the Championship.\nUnder Ferguson, they've beaten Brendan Rodgers' runaway champions in their own backyard at Celtic Park (scoring three times) and yet they've lost at home to Queen's Park, St Mirren and Motherwell (scoring once), though only the latter fixture was on Ferguson's watch.\nThey reached the last eight in Europe but haven't won in seven games at Ibrox. They've lost one in four in the league against Celtic, but they're 17 points behind them. They've outscored Celtic 7-6 in Old Firm games, but Celtic can't even see them in their rear-view mirror.\nAcross the span of the league, Rangers' record against Celtic is markedly better than their record against St Mirren, who are sixth. They've dropped as many points against Hibernian, Aberdeen and Motherwell as they have against Rodgers' serial league winners. Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham Hotspur only got a draw against them in Europe. Seven different domestic teams (including cup ties) have beaten them.\nThe fans have repeatedly turned on Cyriel Dessers, who has now scored 25 goals this season and has 47 goals in 107 games, while giving little of the same kind of vitriol to Danilo, who they signed for \u00a36m for a return (when fit) of 12 in 46.\nVery little of this makes sense. Not for the first time this season, we can borrow Winston Churchill's words to describe this utter basket case: \"A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.\"\nBarry Ferguson harbours ambitions of taking on the Rangers managerial position on a permanent basis\nRangers were combative on Sunday, as predicted. They were fired up and, at times, threatening. Nothing about that was surprising. They scored first. Again, it wasn't a shock-horror moment. They've now taken the lead in four Old Firm games in a row.\nThe puzzle about how they can look pretty coherent in these games and look so bereft in others remains unsolved. Yes, they have more freedom to play when up against strong opposition who don't resort to the low block to frustrate them, but that only goes a certain part of the way in explaining the vast disparity in performances.\nHow can you go toe-to-toe with the likely Europa League finalists Spurs and Manchester United  - scoring in both, drawing one and losing the other to a late, late goal - and yet fall in a goalless heap against teams with a fraction of your playing resources and questionable defensive records?\nAt their worst this season, Rangers have lacked nous, steel, pace, leadership, creativity, goals from midfield, apart from Vaclav Cerny, and goals from a striker other than Dessers.\nAll four of Celtic's starting defenders on Sunday have scored more times this season than Conor Barron, who's on zero. Liam Scales, a centre-half, has as many as Nico Raskin, a defensive midfielder.\nOf the XIs who began at Ibrox, Rangers had two players in double figures for the season, Celtic had five - and that was with Nicolas Kuhn injured and Kyogo Furuhashi sold. Luke McCowan, an unused substitute on the day, has scored more goals than seven of Rangers' outfield starters.\nDespite all of this, they can live with Celtic on any given day. They just can't live with the pressure of should-win and must-win games.\nWe're told none of this is lost on the prospective new owners. They know the team and its foibles, they know the Scottish landscape and who dominates it, they know the distance they must travel across some rocky terrain and they know every inch of progress is going to be hard-won.\nRangers are capable of flash-in-the-pan performances, like Sunday and the other ones that went before against Celtic, but there's an empty feeling, an irrelevance when you suspect their next slip is just days away.\nUnbeaten, but still bowed, Rangers folk will want to go to sleep now and wake only when the new owners are in and making the kind of profound change that's required.\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

        "article_text": "The top US health department plans to require placebo testing for all vaccines in an effort to offer \"straightforward\" public health information, but experts say such testing could limit availability and raise ethical concerns. \nIn a statement first given to the Washington Post, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said this week, \"All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure \u2014 a radical departure from past practices\". \nThe agency did not provide details on which \"new vaccines\" would be included. \nBut officials have suggested that updated Covid-19 shots may be included, which vaccine experts say could slow down vaccine access.  \nPeter Lurie, a former official with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said \"it's hard to tell exactly what is being proposed.\"  \n\"But, broadly, if they mean that every modification to an existing vaccine would require a new placebo-controlled trial, they are treading in ethically dubious territory and likely to deny Americans life-saving vaccines at some point.\"\nHHS has not offered details on the timing of the placebo plan or specify the vaccines involved. \nAn HHS spokesperson told the BBC in a statement that health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's goal of \"radical transparency\" means being \"honest and straightforward about what we know \u2014 and what we don't know \u2014 about medical products, including vaccines\". \nThe statement said none of the childhood vaccines recommended in the US  - except the Covid shot - had undergone \"inert placebo\" testing, meaning \"we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products\". \nBut public health experts say the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including ones for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio and the mumps, were all initially tested against a placebo. In fact, all new immunizations already go through the trials - a type of random testing where one test group receives the immunization, and the other gets a placebo, like a saline shot. \nBut newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process, because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group, and because the shot is only being tweaked in a minor way, vaccine experts said. \nThe coronavirus shot, for example, already has gone through rigorous safety testing, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\"We have a lot of information about the safety of the vaccine,\" he said. \"All we're doing this year is using a different Omicron variant that we used last year and the year before that.\" \nStill, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said this week that the agency was \"taking a look\" at updated coronavirus shots, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News that there is a \"void of data\". \nAn HHS spokesperson told the BBC that \"significant updates to existing vaccines\" may be considered \"new products\" requiring additional clinical evaluation.\n\"A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years,\" the spokesperson said. \nRequiring companies to conduct placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly - and the drug makers could ultimately decide to forgo making the newer, more effective versions of the vaccine altogether, said Dr Lurie.\nBefore taking office - and since assuming the role as secretary - Kennedy has spread   false claims about vaccine safety. His tenure has coincided with one of the worst measles outbreaks in a decade; two children have died and 660 people have been infected in Texas. \nThis week, he encouraged parents to \"do their own research\" about the measles vaccine - which has been considered safe and 97% effective for decades - and raised questions about whether the shot could cause seizures or neurological issues. \nFor months, he has at times endorsed the MMR shot, and at other times, called it a \"personal\" decision. Kennedy also promoted alternative treatments, which doctors say patients should not use without medical supervision. ",

An HHS spokesperson told the BBC in a statement that health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's goal of \"radical transparency\" means being \"honest and straightforward about what we know \u2014 and what we don't know \u2014 about medical products, including vaccines\". But newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process, because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group, and because the shot is only being tweaked in a minor way, vaccine experts said. In a statement first given to the Washington Post, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said this week, \"All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure \u2014 a radical departure from past practices\".",

        "article_text": "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.\nThere's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.\nSo what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?\nTo count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.\nFor someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.\nShe says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.\nRestricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"\nBut what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?\nMs Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.\nThey found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"\nAnd it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".\nBut - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.\nMs Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?\nThe definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.\n\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"\nBut the definition was broadened, Professor Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.\nThe eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.\nAnother subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.\nToday, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.\nThe autism net has been cast wider.\nOne group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.\nStudies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.\nIt's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.\n\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"\nMs Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.\nShe says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".\nBecause autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nNow we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.\nShe says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.\nThe rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.\n\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"\nThere's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.\nFor Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.\nThe 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"\nShe says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"\nHer autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.\nBut others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.\nA focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".\nAs the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.\nThere's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.\nThe internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.\nDisproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.\nBut, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.\nIs there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?\nGinny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.\n\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"\nShe also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".\nBut Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.\n\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"\nYou can listen to The Autism Curve on BBC Sounds now",

People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.The autism net has been cast wider.Autism in women and girlsSarah Hendrickx, who is herself autistic, has been diagnosing autism for more than 15 yearsOne group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?Why are diagnoses rising?The definition of autism has not been static. \"Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.More adults diagnosedThe rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.Venessa Swaby runs support groups for autistic children Environmental causesThere's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.Disproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger.",

        "article_text": "London is Europe's wealthiest city, yet for many living in the capital, having a place to call home feels out of reach, according to the Centre for London (CfL).\nEarlier this week, the independent think tank hosted the London Housing Summit, highlighting the challenges of - and possible solutions to - the housing crisis, which it says is \"spiralling out of control\".\nExperts agree it is a complex issue, but what do figures show us about the scale of the problem?\nAccording to data collected by the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN), there was an 8% increase in rough sleeping in the capital on the same period in 2024.\nNew rough sleepers account for almost half (47%) of the total number of those sleeping rough, intermittent rough sleepers account for 39% and 16% of the recorded number of rough sleepers were living on the streets.\nCHAIN's latest annual report for 2024/25 reveals rough sleeping in London has reached an \"all time high\".\nThe Mayor of London, Sir Sadiq Khan, has committed to ending rough sleeping in London by 2030, and in January 2025 he announced an additional \u00a310m investment in a bid to achieve this goal.\nThe money will go towards expanding the network of its Ending Homelessness Hubs, which provide 24/7 specialist support for people new to rough sleeping and prevention services.\nCouncils have legal duty to house local people who become homeless. Typically, they put people up in hotels or hostels until more permanent arrangements can be made.\nSo, as homelessness has increased in recent years, so therefore has the financial burden on local authorities. \nThe umbrella group representing London's boroughs has said the current spending on temporary accommodation is \"unsustainable\" and puts many councils at risk of becoming \"effectively bankrupt\", creating \"massive uncertainty\" to the future of local services.\nLondon Councils says boroughs overspent on the 2024/25 homelessness budget by \u00a3330m - with spending in this area increasing by 68% in a single year.\nAccording to its recent analysis, more than 183,000 Londoners are currently homeless and living in temporary accommodation such as hostels arranged by their local boroughs.\nThis includes 90,000 children, which equates to more than one per classroom, London Councils says.\nThe human impact of these figures is something the Housing and Mental Health Network aims to highlight to policymakers.\nSpeaking at the London Housing Summit, Dr Sally Zlotowitz, co-chair of the network, said it was a \"growing concern\" that people in temporary accommodation were \"internalising an issue that is a structural crisis\".\nLondon Councils' executive member for housing, Grace Williams, has labelled this an \"emergency\" that was \"devastating the lives of too many Londoners\".\nThe organisation has called on the government to support councils by increasing funding for both short term temporary accommodation needs and longer-term solutions \u2013 like boosting grant funding for affordable housing.\nA government spokesperson said: \"We inherited a serious housing crisis, which is why we are taking urgent and decisive action to end homelessness, fix the foundations of local government and drive forward our Plan for Change.\n\"We are providing \u00a31bn for crucial homelessness services so councils can support families faster. This is an increase of \u00a3233m from 2024 - 25, and London Boroughs have had a funding uplift by more than \u00a378m. \n\"We are also tackling its root causes by building 1.5 million new homes, boosting social and affordable housing and abolishing section 21 no fault evictions.\"\nThe private rental sector in London has shrunk, as landlords increasingly decide to sell their properties.\nAccording to analysis by Trust for London, 45,000 homes were lost from the sector in this way between April 2021-December 2023, equating to a net reduction of 4.3%.\nThe charity also said the sector was shrinking at a much faster rate the most affordable areas to rent in, which it believed had a \"particular impact\" on the ability of low-income households to access private rented homes.\nThe National Residential Landlords Association said \"uncertainty over proposed tax and regulatory changes is leading many landlords to consider leaving the market\". \nThe association added that the demand for private rental homes continued to increase, which was driving up costs for renters as well as reducing choice.\nLondon's 2.7 million private tenants saw their rents rise by 11.5% in 2024, with the capital experiencing the largest increases in England, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nPolling released this week by Centre for London revealed three in five London renters said rent was unaffordable to them personally.\nBoth the need for homes - and the cost of building them - is greater in London than anywhere else in the country, Centre for London analysis has found.\nThe upfront costs in London are 43 times higher than in the West Midlands and 36 times higher than in Greater Manchester. \nThe think tank's research shows building the number of homes needed in the borough of Wandsworth, which has the highest upfront costs in England, will cost four times more than what it would cost to deliver the entire housing target for West Midlands.\nThis comes as polling by the think-tank revealed 45% of Londoners questioned on what they think the biggest problems within London's housing market are, said it was that first-time buyers cannot afford a home.\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: \"The mayor will continue to work in partnership with the government to deliver more genuinely affordable homes through the planning system and new investment so that we can tackle London's housing crisis and build a fairer London for everyone.\"\nDeputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said there is \"no time to waste\" and that it's \"crucial\" to \"get Britain building\".\nWhile targets are in place for new homes \u2013 delegates at the London Housing Summit this week raised concerns about the existing housing stock in London. \nCentre for London's polling revealed a third of Londoners have experienced damp and mould and over a quarter were unable to keep their homes warm.\nHousing campaigner Kwajo Tweneboa uses social media to campaign on issues related to damp and mould and told Eddie Nestor on BBC Radio London, the situation is \"horrific\", adding \"there are times when I ask myself surely it cannot get worse than this?\".\nDuring the mayoral election campaign of 2024, Sir Sadiq pledged his support for a rollout of high-tech mould sensors, which City Hall said would provide an \"early warning system\". \nIndustry leaders have warned there is a 'dire shortage' of construction workers. The latest Office for National Statistics figures show that there are over 35,000 job vacancies and employers report that over half of vacancies cannot be filled due to a lack of required skills \u2013 the highest rate of any sector.\nThe additional requirement of 160,000 construction workers applies specifically to meeting the need of Labour's housebuilding targets. Ahead of the government's pledge to build 1.5m new homes, the CITB had already estimated there would need to be a quarter of a million new construction workers to meet the country's housing demands.\nBefore the 2025 spring statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced \u00a3600m worth of investment to train up to 60,000 more skilled construction workers, and education secretary, Bridget Phillipson has committed to 'skills bootcamps' in the construction sector being expanded, with \u00a3100m to train, upskill and develop workers.\nSo what's the plan for London?\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London said Sir Sadiq Khan had made the capital's housing crisis a \"a key priority for his mayoralty\".\nIn 2018, City Hall established the Mayor's Construction Academy (MCA), a scheme aimed at helping Londoners gain the skills needed to enter the construction industry. \nThe mayor's office said it hoped the MCA would help address the need for more skilled construction workers in London.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

The second McLaren of Lando Norris was third ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, just 0.055secs behind his team-mate.\nAntonelli's team-mate George Russell was fifth fastest, 0.309secs slower than the Italian rookie.\nIt was an outstanding performance from Antonelli, the first time he has beaten Russell in qualifying this season, and the first time he has shown a glimpse of the huge potential Mercedes believed they saw in him when they chose him to replace Lewis Hamilton for this year.\n'Not nice' to see Hamilton struggling - Russell\nAntonelli ready for 'big responsibility' of replacing Hamilton\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nAntonelli has taken a steady approach to the start of his career before this weekend, keen not to make a big mistake that could hurt his weekend.\nBut at the Hard Rock Stadium he looked sure-footed and accomplished from the start of practice and carried that form into qualifying.\n\"I am over the moon,\" he said. \"I did not expect it.\n\"I was feeling good in the car. I was able to improve lap by lap and find that consistency and that gap came all together. I am super happy with that. We will enjoy this moment but I want to focus on tomorrow because I really want to try to repeat myself.\"\nAntonelli embraced his father Marco in the Mercedes garage as the team celebrated his achievement wildly.\n\"It was really nice and also to find him in the garage after qualifying,\" Antonelli added.\n\"I am super-happy to share this moment with him. It is so important to me, he is like a rock. I can always rely on him. I would like to share it with my mum and sister as well but hopefully next time.\"\nStarting the sprint from pole gives him a big opportunity to convert it into a first win, given the power of clear air in F1.\nThis video can not be played\nFive things to watch at Miami Grand Prix\nAntonelli's previous highest grid position this season was fifth.\nPiastri, 10 points ahead of Norris in the championship heading into this weekend, said he believed a lock-up at the last corner on his final lap had cost him pole.\nNorris, who crashed in qualifying at the last race in Saudi Arabia, said: \"Close qualifying. It felt good, happy just to get a good lap in there.\n\"Today's performance was in a good ballpark, not good enough but shows how close it is and how quick the Mercedes are. Close enough that we can still aim for a pole tomorrow.\"\nAntonelli's impressive 0.309secs margin over Russell came despite the Briton joining Verstappen in being the only driver to use two sets of tyres over two runs in the final session. Everyone else waited in the pits while they went out and did just one lap.\nThe idea behind the strategy, which is tight in terms of planning because of the fast turnaround needed in the pits after the first lap, is to allow the driver to record a 'banker' lap and then go all out on the second.\nBut it worked for neither. Russell did not improve on his second lap, and while Verstappen did, he was 0.255secs slower than Antonelli and 0.21secs off Piastri.\nVerstappen, who arrived in Miami late following the birth of his first child, said: \"What we did in Q3 was good, the tyres are holding on quite well, but from P1 struggling with a lot of understeer in the car and with all the low-speed corners, you lose quite a bit of lap time.\"\nHis lack of pace came despite a new floor this weekend as the team seek improved performance.\nVerstappen added: \"In the first sector we were quite competitive because that's where a few high-speed corners are but as soon as you get to the low speed we lack quite a bit of grip. P4 is all right, you have to be realistic with the limitations we have at the moment and it was still quite close.\"\nRussell said: \"Massive congrats to Kimi. He did an amazing job. He has been really quick all day, really impressive.\n\"I have been struggling a little bit, not that comfortable, and we wanted to go early because I didn't have that confidence. P5 is not great but amazing (result) for Kimi and the team.\"\nHamilton, who won the first sprint of the season in China from pole position, was seventh fastest, one place behind team-mate Charles Leclerc. It was an improvement for Hamilton after a dire past three races, but he was still 0.222secs off his team-mate.\nNeither Ferrari driver was happy. \"It was a better session,\" Hamilton said, \"but we are just lacking speed. Keep working on it.\"\nWilliams' Alex Albon, Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso completed the top 10, only the second time the two-time champion's team has made it that high up this season, after team-mate Lance Stroll achieved it in the sprint in China.\nAlbon's team-mate Carlos Sainz should also have been in the top 10 but he made a mistake on his final lap in the second session and will line up 15th.\nVerstappen's team-mate Yuki Tsunoda was knocked out in the first session and will start the sprint 18th.\nThe Japanese complained of being held up by a car coming out of the pits on his first lap, and he did not get around his warm-up lap in time to complete a second run.\nFernando Alonso was among those to congratulate Max Verstappen on the birth of his daughter Lily\nThe youngest driver to take pole position for a full grand prix is Sebastian Vettel, at the 2008 Italian GP at Monza when he was 21 years and two months old\nMcLaren's Piastri fastest in Miami practice\n'It's so bad' - who has got their Miami GP livery right?\nWhat is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions\nMiami Grand Prix preview",

        "article_text": "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.\nThere's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.\nSo what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?\nTo count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.\nFor someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.\nShe says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.\nRestricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"\nBut what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?\nMs Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.\nThey found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"\nAnd it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".\nBut - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.\nMs Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?\nThe definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.\n\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"\nBut the definition was broadened, Professor Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.\nThe eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.\nAnother subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.\nToday, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.\nThe autism net has been cast wider.\nOne group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.\nStudies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.\nIt's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.\n\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"\nMs Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.\nShe says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".\nBecause autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nNow we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.\nShe says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.\nThe rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.\n\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"\nThere's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.\nFor Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.\nThe 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"\nShe says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"\nHer autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.\nBut others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.\nA focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".\nAs the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.\nThere's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.\nThe internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.\nDisproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.\nBut, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.\nIs there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?\nGinny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.\n\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"\nShe also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".\nBut Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.\n\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"\nYou can listen to The Autism Curve on BBC Sounds now",

        "summary": "Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".But - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.Ms Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.The autism net has been cast wider.Autism in women and girlsSarah Hendrickx, who is herself autistic, has been diagnosing autism for more than 15 yearsOne group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?Why are diagnoses rising?The definition of autism has not been static. \"Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.More adults diagnosedThe rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.Venessa Swaby runs support groups for autistic children Environmental causesThere's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.Disproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger.",

Results published online by Cameron County show 212 votes in favour versus six opposed. Billionaire Musk wrote \"Starbase, Texas is now a real city!\" on his social media platform X.\nThe new city covers about 1.6 sq miles (3.9 sq km) that was sparsely populated before SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012.\nThe city's government will comprise of a mayor and two commissioners who will have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. But some nearby residents have opposed the measure and accused the company of harming the local environment.\nSince SpaceX started buying land in the area, company housing and SpaceX facilities have sprouted up, and Mr Musk has a residence. Other evidence of the tycoon's presence includes a road called Memes Street and a giant bust of the tycoon himself, which was recently vandalised.\nAbout 500 people are estimated to live nearby.\nThe possibility of incorporation as a city was rumoured for years before a petition submitted in December 2024 paved the way for Saturday's vote.\nThe first mayor of Starbase will be Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president. Peden ran unopposed, as did two other residents with SpaceX ties who will fill the two commissioner seats. \nThe BBC contacted Mr Peden for comment.\nStarbase will be a Type C city - a category of municipality of fewer than 5,000 people and a designation that among other things will allow officials to levy a property tax of up to 1.5%, according to the Texas Municipal League.\nA bill currently winding through the Texas state legislature could give the new city's officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches and other company activity.\nCurrently closures around SpaceX launches are managed by Cameron County, which includes the nearby city of Brownsville and the resort town of South Padre Island.\n\nThe result of the vote could set up tussles between county officials and Starbase over access to Boca Chica Beach as SpaceX looks to increase the number of launches at its Texas site from five to 25 per year.\nThe top official in Cameron County, Judge Eddie Trevino Jr, opposes the state bill that would allow Starbase control over closures.\nIn recent years Musk has moved many of his operations and corporate headquarters from California to Texas, citing more favourable regulation and his opposition to California's Democratic Party-dominated politics.\nThe headquarters of his companies X and Boring are now on the outskirts of Bastrop, a small city near the state capital Austin and about a five-and-a-half-hour drive north of Starbase.\nIn contrast with Starbase, the development outside Austin does not include much new housing for company workers \u2013 most of whom live in Bastrop or other surrounding communities.\nEnvironmental groups have criticised SpaceX's impact on nearby wildlife, and say the company has increased light pollution and littered the area with debris from rocket launches. \nIn 2024 the company was fined nearly $150,000 (\u00a3113,000) by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for dumping waste water.\nThe company has called the fines the result of \"disagreements over paperwork\" and maintains it follows environmental laws.

        "article_text": "The Premier League's bottom two meet at King Power Stadium on Saturday, so will Leicester or Southampton manage to pick up a rare victory?\n\"Saints still need a point to beat Robbie Savage's useless Derby side, and avoid a share of the 'worst Premier League team ever' trophy,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"But it says it all about how bad both teams have been this season that I still find it hard to back Leicester, even against them. \n\"The Foxes have not even scored at home in the league since 8 December, but if they can't score there against Southampton then they might as well close the whole club down.\"\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.\nFor week 35, he takes on British-Colombian singer-songwriter Sasha Keable, who supports Arsenal.\nSasha's new single, Act Right, is out now. It has already racked up more than 1.4m views on TikTok.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nKeable was co-signed by Beyonc\u00e9 earlier this year, who named her as an artist who inspired her. She has achieved 2m monthly streams on Spotify and is playing Glastonbury, SXSW, Colors NYC and Meltdown festivals this summer.\nSasha is a singer now but grew up in the centre of the football world - her stepdad, Nick Broad, was head of sports science at Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea, and was working with Carlo Ancelotti as performance manager at Paris St-Germain when he died in a car accident in 2013.\n\"I've seen all sides of football, not just as a fan,\" she told BBC Sport. \"When Carlo got fired by Chelsea, my stepdad was fired too. He didn't know what he was going to do, but then Carlo went to PSG and asked him to go with him.\n\"Sadly he passed away while he was in Paris but we are still close to the Ancelotti family. He and Carlo were such good friends.\n\"I look back now and my stepdad was a real pioneer in his work in sports science and nutrition. The things he introduced, like GPS tracking in training and collecting cardio data, were all new then but they are industry standard now.\n\"It's incredible to see his work live on in that way. Some of his old friends and colleagues reach out to me now when they see me doing my own thing on social media and talk about how his work was incredible. \n\"I always wonder how much further he could have pushed the use of science in football if he was still here, but I'm so pleased you can still see his legacy.\"\nNick Broad (right) celebrates with Carlo Ancelotti (centre) after Chelsea's FA Cup win in 2010, which completed a double of Premier League and FA Cup that season\nBefore becoming a singer, Sasha dreamed of being a footballer herself. Now she settles for collecting shirts instead, with a Tino Asprilla Colombia shirt from 1994 taking pride of place.\n\"I played all the time when I was a kid, from the age of about six,\" explained Sasha.\n\"It was a bit different for girls then because it was before the women's game really took off and you didn't really have a route to becoming a professional in this country. I wanted to go to the United States to play. \n\"I was quite a tomboy so I used to play with the boys all the time - I had to. We did not even have a girls team at my school until my friends and I asked to play with the boys and, after that, they formed a team for us.\n\"Fortunately it's all changed now and football is so much more accessible for girls. If you don't have the chance to try something, how do you know if you will love it?\"\nChris Sutton and Sasha Keable were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nMan City 1-0 Wolves\nThis should be a great game, because Wolves are so powerful and they will have no fear at all after winning six games in a row.\nBut Manchester City have looked much more solid in the past few weeks and they are on a bit of a roll themselves, with four successive wins in all competitions.\nPep Guardiola's side will look to control this game, the same way they did in the first half of their FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest, but I don't think they will find it easy to keep Wolves quiet.\nStill, I went against City in their last home game, against Aston Villa, and I was wrong. I am not going to make the same mistake again.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: This is a tough game for City but I still think they will win. 2-1\nAston Villa 1-0 Fulham\nIt would be easy to say the wheels have come off at Aston Villa, wouldn't it? \nIn the past couple of weeks, they have gone out of the Champions League and FA Cup, and losing their last Premier League game has left them playing catch-up in the top-five race.\nI don't think Unai Emery's side will crumble from here, though, even if Marcus Rashford's season-ending injury is a big blow.\nVilla need to win this, and they also need a big performance from Ollie Watkins. If he starts banging the goals in again then that would be a huge boost for their run-in.\nFulham are a nightmare to predict, as I've mentioned in previous weeks, and they are certainly capable of getting something here.\nI don't think Villa can keep a clean sheet - which probably means they will stop Fulham scoring - but I have a feeling things will click for them in front of goal.\nAlso, they are at home too so, if they need them, their fans can help to get them over the line.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nSasha's prediction: I want to back Fulham here, for south-west London. 0-3\nEverton 2-2 Ipswich\nI am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live and I am really looking forward to going to Goodison Park again.\nEverything points towards a home win, despite Everton losing their previous two games. \nIpswich are definitely down now and, while they won't throw in the towel, they might be a little less spirited now they know they are relegated.\nTheir confidence has been sapped over the course of the season and, after watching them recently, I can't back them to get anything here. \nThey were flimsy against Arsenal, then well beaten by Newcastle, and it would be a shock if they scored at all, let alone break my record for the fastest goal scored by an away player at Goodison.\nEverton have stuttered in the past couple of weeks but I don't think that is a bad thing for David Moyes. \nHe has over-achieved since taking charge in January, when the reality is that he has got the same group of players as his predecessor, Sean Dyche, and there needs to be a lot of work done on improving that squad in the summer.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I am not sure if Ipswich will put up as much of a fight now they are relegated. 1-0\nLeicester 2-0 Southampton \nLeicester have been rotten but, somehow, Southampton have been even worse.\nIt's sad to see Jamie Vardy leaving the Foxes at the end of the season, but maybe this might be the send-off he deserves. I am going with him to score the winner.\nThese two teams actually served up a thriller at St Mary's Stadium back in October, when Vardy got one of Leicester's goals as they fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\nI am expecting the same outcome here, just with a lot less excitement. The readers will go for a draw, I am sure of it, but I am pretty confident about Leicester taking this one.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nSasha's prediction: It's mad how bad both these teams have been. I don't think either of them will get a goal, let alone the win. 0-0\nArsenal 1-2 Bournemouth\nWe know how dangerous Bournemouth are, because they beat Arsenal in October, and if Mikel Arteta rests players then this game becomes even harder for the Gunners.\nIt's a tricky situation for Arteta, because he will want to head to Paris St-Germain for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with a bit of momentum, but he has got to balance that with the risk of injury to his key players.\nBournemouth's form has improved of late, and the circumstances mean they definitely have a decent chance of doing the double over Arsenal this season.\nThis all boils down to what the Arsenal team is, so it is difficult to make a call without knowing that, but they are at home and even if they are not at full strength then I can still see them getting a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's a strange situation for Arsenal but I am still backing us to win. 2-0\nGtech Community Stadium, 14:00 BST\nWe know Manchester United are going to make changes here, because seeing out the second leg of their Europa League semi-final with Athletic Bilbao is their priority.\nRuben Amorim's side nicked a point at the very end of their game at Bournemouth last weekend, which sparked mass celebrations, but I really don't see them doing the same against Brentford - they won't be getting the bunting out this time.\nThe Bees are such a dangerous team when they come forward and they will keep on attacking United. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa should get plenty of chances and I can see them getting a goal or two between them.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I just have a feeling United will nick this. 0-1\nAmex Stadium, 14:00 BST\nBrighton got back to winning ways last weekend thanks to Carlos Baleba's brilliant late strike against West Ham.\nThe Seagulls beat Newcastle at St James' Park earlier in the season too, but that was before Eddie Howe's side hit their stride, and it is a big ask for Brighton to repeat that result.\nNewcastle were just relentless in their win over Ipswich and another three points here would be massive in their bid for a top-five finish - I don't think they will get them, but we will see a few goals.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2\nSasha's prediction: Newcastle will take this one. 0-2\nLondon Stadium, 14:00 BST\nThis is 17th versus 16th in the Premier League which tells you how bad both teams have been this season.\nEveryone knows Tottenham's focus will be on their Europa League semi-final second leg with Bodo/Glimt so I think West Ham boss Graham Potter needs a result here more than Ange Postecoglou.\nPotter's results have been poor since he took over from Julen Lopetegui in January and the Hammers fans have not had the upturn they wanted in the way their team play either.\nSpurs can still be dangerous even when they are out of form but Ange is not going to pick his strongest team. That gives West Ham a better chance of getting the win they badly need, but I don't see them doing it in style.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: I don't want to say Tottenham will win, but I think they will. 1-2\nStamford Bridge, 16:30 BST\nI would usually be asking which Chelsea side will turn up, but that applies to Liverpool too this week.\nArne Slot's side could have been out all week celebrating their title win and we don't know how that will affect them.\nYou often play at your best when you have been on the lash in a scenario like theirs. For example, some of my best games for Celtic came after nights out where we had won something and were allowed to have a couple of beers, but I don't know what to expect here.\nChelsea have nicked a couple of results recently, to stay in the race for the top five, but their performances have not been too convincing and their fans still don't seem to have taken to Enzo Maresca's playing style.\nThis is not the test for them that it would be if Liverpool were trying to close out the title but I don't think Slot is the type to let anyone take their foot off the gas. He will put out a strong team and even if they play with more freedom, I still think Liverpool will leave with the points.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nSasha's prediction: I still have a connection with Chelsea because of my stepdad and I have got to back them here. 3-0\nSelhurst Park, 20:00 BST\nCrystal Palace will be on a high after booking their place in the FA Cup final, so this is another very tricky game for Nottingham Forest, who slipped up at home against Brentford on Thursday.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side will have to be stubborn and resolute to get anything at Selhurst Park. They have shown that kind of character plenty of times already this season but they really need it now.\nLooking at the race for the top five you feel like every team involved needs to win every game, but of course that is not going to happen, and I can see my boyhood team Forest dropping more points here. I just hope it doesn't prove crucial for them.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's got to be Palace here. I am loyal to the London teams! 3-0\nChris got five correct results with one exact score from the nine Premier League games he predicted in week 34, giving him a total of 80 points.\nHe beat his guest, golf hero Lee Westwood, who got four correct results with no exact scores, leaving him on 40 points and tied with the BBC readers, who also got five correct results with one exact score.\nWestwood and the BBC readers were wrong about both FA Cup semi-finals, while Chris correctly picked City to beat Forest and wrongly thought Aston Villa would beat Crystal Palace. Those ties do not count towards the weekly totals.\nThe other game from week 34, Manchester City's 2-1 win over Aston Villa, took place on 22 April and does not count towards the weekly result either.\nSherelle, the guest in week 33, made the prediction instead of Westwood and picked up 40 points for the guests' overall total (but not her own individual tally) with an exact score. Chris and the BBC readers both went for a 2-1 Villa win.",

        "article_text": "A few miles from East London's perennially hip neighbourhoods, an explosion of art and culture is transforming a once-neglected stretch into one of the city's hottest destinations.\nEast London. Two words that, if you know anything about the UK's capital, often conjure up opposing opinions.\nThere are those who mourn its supposedly waning hip factor \u2013 regaling stories of 1980s warehouse art shows or squat parties \u2013 while deploring the rampant commercialism of its supercharged epicentre, Shoreditch. Others, meanwhile, will rave about new independent galleries or small-plate restaurants in nearby Dalston, Bethnal Green or Hackney. Yet, the general consensus is that East London's long-buzzing arts and food scenes are continuing to move ever further out, driven \u2013 as in other world cities \u2013 by the relentless search for affordability.\nBut a few miles east of these oversubscribed neighbourhoods are two boroughs that are lesser known to visitors and have been quietly emerging as London's next artsy enclave: Waltham Forest and Newham. Stretching north from Stratford up to Leyton and Walthamstow, this\u00a0 once-unfashionable outer area hasn't always matched East London's brand of cool. And yet in spring 2025, it's witnessing a cultural explosion, with new museums, theatres and bars and some of the city's biggest arts openings that are putting this under-the-radar corner of London on the map.\nThe catalyst for these boroughs' rise was the 2012 London Olympics, which transformed the area's scrapyards and brownfield land into the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park \u2013 an oasis of rivers, canals and water meadows bordered by Stratford, Leyton and Hackney.\n\"The Olympics brought a huge amount of investment in infrastructure, transport links and housing,\" said Britannia Morton, co-chief executive of Sadler's Wells, the world-famous Islington-based dance theatre founded in the 18th Century. \"The Olympic Park, where our new Sadler's Wells East is based, was created converting marshland into this beautiful environment.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSadler's Wells East, which opened in February 2025, is located in East Bank, a \u00a31.1bn new waterside cultural quarter in the Olympic Park. \"[It was] formerly known as Fridge Mountain \u2013 a dumping ground for old electronic appliances,\" said Morton. The first landmark to open here was the University of the Arts' London College of Fashion in October 2023, which has galleries and a cafe open to the public. Sadler's Wells East was built in Italian red brick and houses a 550-seat state-of-the-art auditorium and six dance studios.\n\"Whether you're interested in ballet, hip-hop, kathak or contemporary, our eclectic programme brings the most innovative work created locally, nationally and internationally to Stratford,\" said Morton. Visitors can enjoy free events in its public spaces, including lunchtime dance classes on the community dance floor, as well as a bar and restaurant. There are panoramic views from its rooftop over the London Aquatics Centre, Sir Anish Kapoor's 114.5m ArcelorMittal Orbit (the UK's largest sculpture) and the London Stadium.\nAcross the park at the Here East innovation and tech campus (formerly the London Olympics Media Centre) is the glass-fronted V&A East Storehouse, opening 31 May 2025. It's the first half of the new V&A East, whose South Kensington-based original is the world's largest museum of applied arts, decorative arts and design, with more than 2.8 million objects in its permanent collection.\nThis first instalment is essentially a new home for the V&A East's reserve collection (hence the name \"Storehouse\"), and \"a magical new behind-the-scenes museum experience\", according to its deputy director and COO Tim Reeve. With 100 curated mini displays, its half a million works range from the\u00a0Glastonbury Festival\u00a0Archive to Dior\u00a0haute couture and mid-century furniture. Its\u00a0world-first Order an Object experience allows anyone to book an appointment to view anything from Roman frescoes to Elton John's costumes. It will also be home to the\u00a0new David Bowie Centre, opening 13 September 2025, displaying the singer's outfits, lyrics and archive.\n\"It's a new standard for access to national collections,\" said Reeve. \"We're encouraging visitors to feel empowered to make their own journeys through the V&A's global collections.\"\nThe second half, the five-storey V&A East Museum, is opening in East Bank in spring 2026. Its main exhibition hall will celebrate leading artists, designers and performers in major shows, and its galleries will narrate stories of East London's creative and manufacturing heritage.\nElsewhere in East Bank, BBC Music Studios, which will house the BBC Symphony Orchestra and host recording sessions and live performances, is slated to open in late 2025 or early 2026.\nAnd that's not all. A couple of miles north in Walthamstow, another major cultural opening is happening. While this diverse north-east London suburb has long been thriving \u2013 its pretty village centre, some of which dates to the 15th Century, is indeed a gentrification hotspot \u2013 the imposing new Soho Theatre Walthamstow will further raise the neighbourhood's profile when it opens on 2 May 2025. A former cinema designed in 1930 by architect Cecil Masey, the distinctive building was inspired by the Moorish architecture of the 13th-Century Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. In its mid-20th-Century heyday, it also hosted gigs by The Beatles, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Dusty Springfield, Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones \u2013 before closing in 2003.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 London Overground: Four stops to explore the 'real' London\n\u2022 Five unusual historical experiences in London\n\u2022 See another side to London at eight of its most unusual tourist attractions\nWhen it finally reopens, with its original Art Deco stylings revived, the Soho Theatre Walthamstow will have a 960-seat Grade II-listed auditorium, studio spaces, four bars and a restaurant. (In comparison, its current West End location has a capacity of just 240.)\n\"This is the first time we've had a professional theatre in the area,\" said executive assistant Annie Jones, who worked on the restoration project for more than five years. \"The programme will list up to nine shows a night \u2013 a mix of comedy, cabaret and theatre all rooted in its community. Waltham Forest has always been welcoming, with its vibrancy, multiculturalism and openness, and its\u00a0spirit has only\u00a0grown.\"\nConnecting Stratford, the Olympic Park and Walthamstow is Leyton. This once-maligned area is now home to one of the most up-and-coming strips in East London. Previously more synonymous with fly-tipping, Tilbury Road railway arches (a narrow alleyway opposite Leyton Midland Road station) has been transformed by new arrivals in the last year alone, including three bars, a bakery, a Caribbean restaurant and two soon-to-open artisan cafes. The opening of two popular microbreweries in the last few years on the same stretch sparked this sudden transformation: Gravity Well, nestled in the station arch itself, and the edgier Libertalia taproom, named after a mythical anarchist colony in the 17th Century.\nFor Leyton-raised Danny Saunders, owner of tropical cocktail bar Leyton Calling (which opened in summer 2024) and cosy candlelit pub Chop Shop Tavern (which opened in February 2025), it's a personal coup, having known the area since the 1980s. \"I've come full circle,\" he said, with a smile. \"My latest bar is in the actual arch where I set up my first car repair business back in the day.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLeyton's rise as a whole has, however, been something of a slow-burn. Back in the mid-2010s, nearby Francis Road began to be taken over by independent creative businesses. \"I opened here in 2017,\" said Aim\u00e9e Madill, who owns Phlox, a bookstore, cafe and wine bar. \"It was risky as it was still a 'less-developed' part of London, but local indie bookshops are more than a business, they're a sign of confidence in a community.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nPedestrianised in 2017, the tree-lined street has since blossomed with chic cafes and bars: two of the latest openings are vinyl store-cum-craft beer bar Dreamhouse Records and Loop Dining, a pop-up space launched in summer 2024 to host weekly residencies from buzzy up-and-coming chefs.\n\"Unlike Stratford,\" Madill said,\u00a0\"Leyton is characterised\u00a0by small makers and creatives existing side by side with businesses who've been here decades. Most of us live here, so we've been able to revitalise, rather than reinvent, parts of the area \u2013 which adds to the sense of community.\"\nSo what's next for outer East London? \"Young people and families are now priced out of Hackney,\" said Michaela Zelenanska, who runs natural wine bar Swirl, which opened in December 2024 on Tilbury Road. \"Leyton and neighbouring Leytonstone seem a logical next big thing. It's small businesses that make the place what it is.\"\nWill London continue to move ever further east? \"We're already engaging with artists, audiences and community groups in Barking and Dagenham,\" said Morton, referencing two outer London suburbs several miles from Leyton and Stratford. \"East London has always been a creative crucible.\"\nStephen Emms is an East London resident who writes a weekly newsletter called Leytonstoner about the arts, food and drink scenes primarily in Leyton, Leytonstone, Stratford and Walthamstow.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Irish rap group Kneecap have been in the spotlight for controversial reasons this week and BBC News NI asked young fans in their west Belfast home if their views of the group have changed.\nThe controversy began when a video of a November 2023 gig emerged in which a member of the west Belfast trio says: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.\"\nOn Thursday, the Metropolitan Police said they will investigate online videos showing Kneecap calling for the death of British MPs and shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\".\nKneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual.\nBoth Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\nThe husband of murdered MP Jo Cox later called on Kneecap to give a \"real apology\".\nKatie Amess, whose father Sir David Amess was an MP when he was murdered in 2021, said she was \"gobsmacked at the stupidity of somebody or a group of people being in the public eye and saying such dangerous, violent rhetoric\".\nKneecap say the videos have been taken out of context.\nA number of politicians have called for the Irish rap band to be uninvited from UK gigs.\nSome of the band's performances have been cancelled but a number of artists have signed a joint statement in support of Kneecap and freedom of expression through the band's label Heavenly Recordings.\nBut what do young people on the Falls Road in west Belfast think? \nPE and Primary Education student Naoise McCrory, 19, has been a fan of Kneecap for a few years and said her opinion on the group hasn't changed. \n\"Although there's a lot of controversy right now I'm still a fan of Kneecap and I think what they're doing is they're just spreading awareness on major issues that are going on right now in other parts of the world,\" she said.\n\"I can understand completely why some people have been offended but at the same time I just think personally what they're doing is that they're just trying to spread awareness and some things have been taken too literally and people can be offended on both sides.\"\nNaoise has tickets to go and see Kneecap in their Belfast concert at Boucher Playing Fields and says she will \"100% still go to their gig\". \nCinematography and photography student Cian Davison, 24, said he doesn't agree with what Kneecap have been saying recently but he enjoys their music. \n\"I think they're putting Irish language back on the map,\" he said.\n\"They're very talented individuals, not afraid to wear their identity on their chest and I really enjoy their music. I think they're a great artform and platform for young people to listen to and to relate to.\n\"Obviously to threaten anybody, to make a violent threat is disappointing, like it's not on and shouldn't happen anywhere no matter who you are or where you're from.\"\nCian added: \"Depending on what they say in the future, obviously they should be allowed to have freedom of speech within their artcraft.\n\"They have a lot of susceptible, young fans that would do anything that they say so I think it's important that they watch what they say.\" \nEnglish literature student Chloe Bell, 20, is planning to watch Kneecap live when they support Fontaines DC at Belfast Vital in August. \nShe says she still supports Kneecap.\n\"I still listen to their music and I know people are just trying to badmouth them but sure nowadays people are always trying to badmouth people on the internet so everyone always has a problem with something,\" she said.\nChloe said she expects the concert this summer with Fontaines DC will go ahead.\nAidan Toner, 21, is from west Belfast.\nHe said has seen some videos but they haven't changed his opinion on the trio at all. \n\"They're standing up for their country, as every person should... they can do what they want,\" he said.\n\"I like their music - I don't think the gigs should be cancelled.\"\nMusic and Primary Education student Eoin Ferry, 19, said his opinion on Kneecap hasn't changed. \n\"I actually do love Kneecap,\" he said.\n\"I've followed them for years and I do love their music and I enjoy listening to them.\n\"I think that since I have been a fan for such a long time, it's not really changing my opinion on them. I still stand with them.\"\nHe added: \"Personally as a musician myself, it's up to yourself if you want to [state political opinions]. \n\"You shouldn't be made to do anything you don't want to do but if you want to I think that should be fine.\n\"Everyone's always going to have different opinions so I think Kneecap should just keep doing what they're doing and it's up to everyone else what they think of it.\"\nKneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.\nThe group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap and DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed.\nTheir rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalised film starring Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender.\nThe film won a British Academy of Film Award (Bafta) in February 2025.",

        "article_text": "Leeds won 29 Championship games this season - more than any other side\nAn incredible Championship title race came to a fitting end on Saturday, running all the way into stoppage time before Leeds United finally pipped Burnley to the post.\nManor Solomon's last-gasp winner at relegated Plymouth Argyle meant Leeds matched the Clarets' win over play-off chasing Millwall, just as the home fans at Turf Moor were gearing up for an almighty party.\nBefore kick-off, Leeds knew it was in their hands, but in typical style, twists and turns followed.\nIt was an epic ending to what has statistically been the most closely-fought hunt for the title. \nFor the first time ever, two teams reached 100 points in the same Championship campaign, with Leeds' superior goal difference proving decisive.\nWith Birmingham City also finishing with 111 points in League One, it is the first time in the Football League's 137-year history that three sides have earned a century of points in the same campaign.\nLeeds seal title with late winner as Argyle go down\nBurnley beat Millwall but miss out on title\nChampionship: Leeds clinch title; Luton down, Coventry and Bristol City into play-offs\nPop star Natasha Bedingfield sang on the pitch after Burnley secured promotion\nBurnley had seen records tumble, including a Championship-best 30 clean sheets - equalling Port Vale's Football League record set in 1953-54 - and have conceded just 16 goals.\nThey have not lost at home all season, have been beaten only twice in the league, and have been unbeaten in 33 Championship games since losing at Millwall in November.\nIt seemed unlikely they would not return to the Premier League as champions, as manager Scott Parker admitted.\n\"If you'd have said to me you'd reach 100 points, 33 games unbeaten, 16 goals conceded and you wouldn't win the league I'd have said 'no chance',\" Parker told BBC Radio Lancashire, after adding a third promotion to his name after success with Fulham in 2020 and Bournemouth in 2022. \n\"We've done remarkably this year. I'm so proud. We came into today hoping it would go our way, but wanting to win the game and get to 100 points, We did that.\"\nMeanwhile, where Burnley have thrived as a defensive unit, Leeds shone in attack. With 95 goals, they were by some distance the top scorers in the division. Joel Piroe (19), Dan James (12) and Solomon (10) have all reached double figures this season.\n\"I can't put into words what I'm feeling right now. It is a dream come true to score the winning goal and take this Championship,\" an emotional Solomon told BBC Radio Leeds at full-time. \n\"Throughout the season we've shown we deserve this trophy and to finish in the first spot. I'm so glad it happened.\n\"We all knew what was happening at Burnley and we knew we needed to score. It paid off and the ball went into the net. It will take me a few days to digest what happened today, right now I'm going to celebrate.\"\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke (right) has won promotion from the Championship for the third time\nLike Parker, Leeds boss Daniel Farke has vast experience of getting out of the Championship. \nHe did so as champions with Norwich City in 2019 and 2021 and has now led the West Yorkshire club back to the Premier League after bouncing back from play-off final heartache against Southampton a year ago.\nFarke told BBC Sport: \"Of course I'm happy that we won this game in the final stages and are officially allowed to label ourselves as champions and the best team this season.\n\"It's an emotionally moving day because we have invested so much and wanted to crown ourselves with some silverware.\n\"It feels pretty, pretty special in the dressing room and I'm very happy for my players and staff, it means so much for them, and also our supporters.\"\nNobody should forget Sheffield United, either. Although four defeats in five games in April, including a loss at Burnley which ultimately knocked them out of contention for automatic promotion, proved fatal, the Blades led for long periods and looked the most likely.\nChris Wilder's side will need to go again in the play-offs, starting against Bristol City in the semi-finals.

        "article_text": "\"Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral\" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.\nThe top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.\nSo much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.\nBut 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.\nBut is that accurate, or too simplistic?\nTo get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.\nBy 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.\n\"One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,\" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.\n\"During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.\"\nSplits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.\nDepending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.\nWestern Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.\nBut people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.\nAs a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as \"ambiguous\".\n\"The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,\" he tells me.\nCzechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. \"During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.\"\nRussia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership \"Nazis\" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.\nFor VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine \u2013 it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.\nThe official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was \"humanitarian grounds\". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.\nThat invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. \"That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,\" says Zantovsky.\n\"It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.\"\nThis is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.\nEurope has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.\nBut this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.\nFollowing WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.\nThe idea of a \"West\" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.\nMight we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.\n\"Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,\" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.\nThe war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.\nEurope, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.\nThe televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.\nA YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.\nIn Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.\nIf Russia gets US recognition for \"crimes of conquest\" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.\nAnd with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.\nThe message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: \"We cannot rely on the US anymore,\" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.\nThat's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.\nThe Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.\nUrsula von der Leyen, once Germany's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: \"The West as we knew it, no longer exists.\"\nStill, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.\nChina, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.\nTrump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.\nWittig calls it \"the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe\".\nDespite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.\nSome also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this \"an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years\".\nPerhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.\nAnalysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities. \nThis is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.\nMr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.\n\"We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,\" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.\n\"A need can often bring forward the right people,\" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.\n\"Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?\"\nEight decades on from the hell they experienced, surviving WW2 veterans would tell you they fervently hope that won't be the case.",

        "article_text": "In Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.\nPeople here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.\nIn recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.\n\"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic \u2026 Trump's the best thing America ever had.''\nOther spectators are more nuanced.\n\"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\"\nAustralia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency \u2013 and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.\nBut Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world. \nTrump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' \u2013 a value that embodies friendship and loyalty \u2013 and that extends to politics too.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.\nAll of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?\nIn the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.\n\"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\"\nThe US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China \u2013 and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.\nThe rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.\nIt's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.\nBack in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.\n\"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that \u2026 we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\"\nAustralia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.\nA blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.\n\"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\"\nWhile only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.\n\"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\"\nAnd, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.\n\"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\"\nA poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.\nAnd a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.\nBig questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.\nDutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.\n\"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\"\nDutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker \u2026 a big thinker.\"\nAnd he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.\nAlbanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.\nThat may turn out to be in his favour.\nIndeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.\nFor Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.\n\"What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,\" he says. \n\"The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \"\nBut whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.\n\"We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,\" says Andrews. \"I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism \u2013 so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.\"\nBack at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos \u2013 the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground. \nFlying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Listen to Katy read this article\nIn Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.\nPeople here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.\nIn recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.\n\"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic \u2026 Trump's the best thing America ever had.''\nOther spectators are more nuanced.\n\"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\"\nAustralia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency \u2013 and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.\nBut Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world. \nTrump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' \u2013 a value that embodies friendship and loyalty \u2013 and that extends to politics too.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.\nAll of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?\nIn the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.\n\"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\"\nThe US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China \u2013 and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.\nThe rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.\nIt's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.\nBack in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.\n\"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that \u2026 we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\"\nAustralia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.\nA blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.\n\"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\"\nWhile only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.\n\"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\"\nAnd, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.\n\"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\"\nA poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.\nAnd a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.\nBig questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.\nDutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.\n\"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\"\nDutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker \u2026 a big thinker.\"\nAnd he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.\nAlbanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.\nThat may turn out to be in his favour.\nIndeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.\nFor Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.\n\"What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,\" he says. \n\"The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \"\nBut whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.\n\"We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,\" says Andrews. \"I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism \u2013 so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.\"\nBack at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos \u2013 the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground. \nFlying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

She is currently in exile in India and an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is in charge.\nSince then Dhaka has demanded Hasina be extradited to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her, and Delhi has not officially reacted to the demand.\nIndia has also frequently criticised reports of attacks on the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh. It recently said the alleged killing of a Hindu community leader \"reflects a pattern of systematic persecution under the interim government\".\nBangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation, denies targeting minorities, calling most incidents politically motivated or ordinary crimes. Hindus make up less than 10% of its 170 million population.\nAs the countries spar, firms are counting the cost.\nYarn, vital for Bangladesh's clothing factories, can still enter by sea and air - but they are slower and costlier routes.\nIn 2024, India had exported $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn) worth of cotton yarn to Bangladesh, a third of it via land ports.\nThe now-halted transhipment facility let Bangladeshi exporters send clothes made for high-end brands by road to Indian cities, from where it would be flown to Europe and the US.\n\"It's a blow [to Bangladesh's fast-fashion export industry],\" says Anis Ahmed, head of supply chain firm MGH Group, which ships for European fast-fashion brands. \"The India route got cargo to Western countries in a week. By sea, it takes up to eight weeks.\"\nBangladesh, the world's second-largest garment exporter after China, shipped $38bn in clothing last year. Over $1bn of this moved via the India land-air route, which Ahmed says was thriving.\nLimited air freight capacity and under-equipped airports hamper direct exports from Bangladesh.\nMany see Delhi's withdrawal of the transhipment facility as a response to remarks by Yunus during a recent China visit.\nHe had called Bangladesh the \"only guardian of the ocean\" for India's landlocked north-east and suggested that the region could become an \"extension of the Chinese economy.\"\nLeaders from India's north-eastern states called the comments \"offensive\".\nYunus's remarks, spotlighting India's strategic vulnerability in the region to China, raised alarms in Delhi.\nIndia's north-east is linked to the mainland by the 20km-wide Siliguri Corridor - dubbed the \"chicken's neck\" - flanked by Nepal and Bangladesh and close to Tibet's Chumbi Valley.\nWith a history of border tensions and having lost a war in 1962, Indian defence planners fear that China could target the corridor to cut off the north-eastern states from the rest of the country in any future conflict.\nBangladeshi analysts say Yunus's remarks were misinterpreted and aimed at promoting regional connectivity.\nDuring his China visit, Dhaka also welcomed Beijing's interest in a $1bn Teesta River project in northern Bangladesh.\nIndian analysts warn that Chinese involvement in the project, which is not far from the strategic Siliguri Corridor, could unsettle Delhi.\nBut there is concern on both sides over the frosty ties.\nResentment is growing in Bangladesh over tightened Indian visa rules, with approvals plunging since Hasina was driven from power. Previously, two million Bangladeshis visited India yearly for tourism, business, education and medical care. The number of visas issued daily has dropped by over 80% in the past few months according to local media.\nHasina's stay in India and the extradition demand remains a big irritant.\n\"They should realise that there is no way that we can just hand Hasina to them. We know what will happen to her if she's handed over. I think public opinion in India would not countenance that,\" says Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary.\nAmid rising tensions, India's clothing manufacturers' association has called for a ban on Bangladeshi garment imports via land. Bangladeshi analysts warn that more trade barriers would be counter-productive.\n\"I think there is a strong view nowadays in Bangladesh that we should also reassess the other transit and transhipment facilities given to India [for its north-eastern states] by the earlier [Hasina] government,\" Debapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka, tells the BBC.\nIndia uses Bangladeshi ports, roads and waterways to transport goods to its landlocked north-east, cutting distance, time and costs. However, officials say transit volumes haven't reached expected levels.\nDelhi-Dhaka tensions are rising amid growing ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan.\nBangladesh, once East Pakistan, fought for independence in 1971 with Indian support. Hasina distanced herself from Pakistan during her 15-year rule.\nPakistan's Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch visited Dhaka last month, the first such visit in 15 years. A planned visit by Pakistan Deputy PM Ishaq Dar was postponed due to tensions between Delhi and Islamabad over the deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir last week.\n\"I don't think there is any concern over Dhaka's reachout to Pakistan. If there is any suggestion that there is an intent to work together and make things difficult for India, then that will obviously cause concern,\" says Saran, the former Indian diplomat.\nSharp official reactions from both sides are also influencing public opinion in India and Bangladesh. There is a growing anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh, with Indian media accused of exaggerating the attacks on minorities and Islamist threats.\nThe people-to-people ties built over years seem to be on the retreat, and analysts point out that if both sides fail to stay calm, their actions could harm trade and economic relations.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has attracted criticism from some Catholics after posting an AI-generated image of himself as the Pope. \nThe picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics mourn the death of Pope Francis, who died on 21 April, and prepare to choose the next pontiff. \nThe New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mocking the faith. The post comes days after he joked to media: \"I'd like to be Pope.\"\nTrump is not the first president to be accused of mocking the Catholic faith. Former US President Joe Biden, a Catholic, caused outrage a year ago when he made the sign of the cross at a pro-abortion access rally in Florida. \nVatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to answer questions about Trump's post during a briefing with journalists on Saturday. The Vatican is preparing to host a conclave to choose Francis's successor beginning on Wednesday.\nThe image posted by Trump on Friday night features him wearing a white cassock and pointed mitre, traditionally worn by a bishop. He wears a large cross around his neck, and has his finger held up, with a solemn facial expression.\nThe New York State Catholic Conference, which represents bishops in New York, took to X to criticise the picture. \n\"There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,\" the group wrote.\n\"We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.\"\nLeft-leaning Italian former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also blasted Trump's post. \n\"This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,\" Renzi wrote in Italian on X. \nBut the White House rejected any suggestion that the Republican president was making fun of the papacy.\n\"President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects to Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,\" said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\nThe backlash continued on Sunday, as New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan - who has been friendly with Trump for years - told reporters that he disliked the image.\n\"It wasn't good,\" he said, after attending a Mass in Rome. \"I hope he didn't have anything to do with that.\"\nSwitching to Italian, he called it a \"brutta figura\", a phrase meaning a bad or embarrassing impression.\nAsked if the White House should take down the image and apologise, he said - again in Italian - \"who knows\" and declined to speak more about it.",

However, they reached lunch with a 20-point haul by no means secure at 109-4, needing 76 more.\nBut they were able to move into the top three places in the Division One table midway through the afternoon tea thanks to first-class debutant Zen Malik, who finished 49 not out off 73 balls, including a pulled six off George Hill to win it.\nWhile Warwickshire won their second game in four at the start of this season, Yorkshire have now lost two from four and are in the top flight's bottom three.\nThe hosts will be mightily frustrated at the fact they were unable to capitalise on the one-game availability of England batting duo Harry Brook and Joe Root. The latter's second-innings 90 was their best score in four innings.\nHowever, consistently, they did not bowl well enough on a grassy pitch offering significant assistance for the bowlers. \nOverseas Australian debutant Jordan Buckingham went at more than seven runs an over across the two innings on his debut, striking only twice.\nAnd the Bears were deserved winners, backing up last month's one-wicket success at Durham.\nWhile they did not dominate this fixture, they were on top for much of it and were able to capitalise on winning an important toss and bowling Yorkshire out for 205 on day one.\nTheir new-ball seamer Ethan Bamber excelled with match figures of 9-107. Australian Test all-rounder Beau Webster should also be credited for an excellent 85 in the first innings, which secured what proved to be a decisive 48-run lead for the visitors.\nCaptain Davies started positively this morning. Of the seven boundaries he hit in his 31, three of them came off one Hill over. Two were clipped through the leg-side and the other handsomely driven through the covers.\nHowever, he was bowled through the gate by a beauty of an in-swinger from Ben Coad, losing his off and middle stumps in the process as the score fell to 45-1 in the 13th over - the day's 10th.\nBuckingham then had Hamza Shaikh caught behind at 60-2, immediately before a 10-minute rain delay, and Yates and Dan Mousley fell to New Zealand quick Ben Sears and Jordan Thompson respectively to boost Yorkshire before lunch.\nLeft-handed Yates had been more reserved than his opening partner Davies, though by no means becalmed.\nHe pulled Buckingham for four through midwicket and clipped Thompson through the same region for a couple of boundaries in as many overs as the score reached 85-2, 100 more needed for the visitors.\nThere would have been some nerves in the away dressing room when Yates was undone by extra bounce from Sears and edged a looping catch to Root at first slip before, at the start of the morning's final over, Thompson uprooted Mousley's off-stump - 109-4 in the 30th over.\nThough, those nerves wouldn't have been around for long given how settled 27-year-old Malik looked in a fifth-wicket partnership of 59 with Ed Barnard.\nRight-hander Malik was strong on both sides of the wicket, and when he beautifully drove Thompson for four straight of mid-on to move into the thirties, Warwickshire were 136-4 needing 49 more.\nAll-rounder Barnard, meanwhile, had an excellent game with three wickets in each innings, 41 with the bat first time around and then 37 to help get them over the line.\nWith the Bears closing in, he even nonchalantly ramped Sears for six over third but edged the same bowler behind with 17 needed.

        "article_text": "More than two million people have attended a free Lady Gaga concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, city officials say. \nThe pop star's biggest ever concert was paid for by the city in an attempt to revitalise Rio's economy. \nThey expect it could bring in $100m (\u00a375m) to the local economy. \nSaturday's performance was part of a promotional tour for Lady Gaga's eighth album, Mayhem, whose songs include Abracadabra and Die With a Smile. She last performed in Brazil in 2012.\nSome fans - known as Gaga's \"Little Monsters\" - began queuing early in the morning and waited in long lines to gain access to the beach.\nA massive security operation was in place, with 5,000 police officers on duty and attendees having to pass through metal detectors. The authorities also used drones and facial recognition cameras to help police the event. \nLady Gaga is not the first person to play a free concert in Rio. Madonna gave a  concert on Copacabana beach in May 2024, which was also paid for by the city.\n\n\"You waited for me, you waited for more than 10 years for me,\" an emotional Lady Gaga told the crowds as she unfurled a Brazilian flag.  \n\"Brazil, I'm ready. I'm going to give it my all.\"\nThe pop star appeared in Brazil-themed costumes for some of her acts, with outfits inspired by the national football team. \nThousands sang along with her best known hits including Alejandro, Poker Face and Abracadabra, creating an electric atmosphere as many waved rainbow-themed fans and watched on huge screens along the beach. \nFans travelled from all across the country to see the grandiose performance.  \nOne man, 28-year-old Luan Messias, said he spent all night on a bus from Itanhaem in neighbouring Sao Paulo state.\nAlisha Duarte, 22, told AFP news agency she started queuing at 0740 in the morning. \"Lady Gaga is worth it! It's going to get super crowded, but we'll survive,\" she said. \nAnother fan, Paulo Oliveira, explained why people were so excited about the concert. She \"tells us that we can be who we are, that we can be different and that being different is cool,\" he told Reuters. \nIt's going to be an \"unforgettable show\", concert attendee Lai Borges told Reuters on her way in. \"It's going to be emotional and I'm going to cry a lot,\" she said. \nAs the event drew to a close, Lady Gaga told the audience - in a reference to the nickname for Lady Gaga fans - \"we are monsters and monsters never die,\" and she brought the concert to a close with Bad Romance, perhaps her most famous song.",

        "article_text": "The Premier League's bottom two meet at King Power Stadium on Saturday, so will Leicester or Southampton manage to pick up a rare victory?\n\"Saints still need a point to beat Robbie Savage's useless Derby side, and avoid a share of the 'worst Premier League team ever' trophy,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"But it says it all about how bad both teams have been this season that I still find it hard to back Leicester, even against them. \n\"The Foxes have not even scored at home in the league since 8 December, but if they can't score there against Southampton then they might as well close the whole club down.\"\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.\nFor week 35, he takes on British-Colombian singer-songwriter Sasha Keable, who supports Arsenal.\nSasha's new single, Act Right, is out now. It has already racked up more than 1.4m views on TikTok.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nKeable was co-signed by Beyonc\u00e9 earlier this year, who named her as an artist who inspired her. She has achieved 2m monthly streams on Spotify and is playing Glastonbury, SXSW, Colors NYC and Meltdown festivals this summer.\nSasha is a singer now but grew up in the centre of the football world - her stepdad, Nick Broad, was head of sports science at Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea, and was working with Carlo Ancelotti as performance manager at Paris St-Germain when he died in a car accident in 2013.\n\"I've seen all sides of football, not just as a fan,\" she told BBC Sport. \"When Carlo got fired by Chelsea, my stepdad was fired too. He didn't know what he was going to do, but then Carlo went to PSG and asked him to go with him.\n\"Sadly he passed away while he was in Paris but we are still close to the Ancelotti family. He and Carlo were such good friends.\n\"I look back now and my stepdad was a real pioneer in his work in sports science and nutrition. The things he introduced, like GPS tracking in training and collecting cardio data, were all new then but they are industry standard now.\n\"It's incredible to see his work live on in that way. Some of his old friends and colleagues reach out to me now when they see me doing my own thing on social media and talk about how his work was incredible. \n\"I always wonder how much further he could have pushed the use of science in football if he was still here, but I'm so pleased you can still see his legacy.\"\nNick Broad (right) celebrates with Carlo Ancelotti (centre) after Chelsea's FA Cup win in 2010, which completed a double of Premier League and FA Cup that season\nBefore becoming a singer, Sasha dreamed of being a footballer herself. Now she settles for collecting shirts instead, with a Tino Asprilla Colombia shirt from 1994 taking pride of place.\n\"I played all the time when I was a kid, from the age of about six,\" explained Sasha.\n\"It was a bit different for girls then because it was before the women's game really took off and you didn't really have a route to becoming a professional in this country. I wanted to go to the United States to play. \n\"I was quite a tomboy so I used to play with the boys all the time - I had to. We did not even have a girls team at my school until my friends and I asked to play with the boys and, after that, they formed a team for us.\n\"Fortunately it's all changed now and football is so much more accessible for girls. If you don't have the chance to try something, how do you know if you will love it?\"\nChris Sutton and Sasha Keable were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nEtihad Stadium, 20:00 BST\nThis should be a great game, because Wolves are so powerful and they will have no fear at all after winning six games in a row.\nBut Manchester City have looked much more solid in the past few weeks and they are on a bit of a roll themselves, with four successive wins in all competitions.\nPep Guardiola's side will look to control this game, the same way they did in the first half of their FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest, but I don't think they will find it easy to keep Wolves quiet.\nStill, I went against City in their last home game, against Aston Villa, and I was wrong. I am not going to make the same mistake again.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: This is a tough game for City but I still think they will win. 2-1\nVilla Park, 12:30 BST\nIt would be easy to say the wheels have come off at Aston Villa, wouldn't it? \nIn the past couple of weeks, they have gone out of the Champions League and FA Cup, and losing their last Premier League game has left them playing catch-up in the top-five race.\nI don't think Unai Emery's side will crumble from here, though, even if Marcus Rashford's season-ending injury is a big blow.\nVilla need to win this, and they also need a big performance from Ollie Watkins. If he starts banging the goals in again then that would be a huge boost for their run-in.\nFulham are a nightmare to predict, as I've mentioned in previous weeks, and they are certainly capable of getting something here.\nI don't think Villa can keep a clean sheet - which probably means they will stop Fulham scoring - but I have a feeling things will click for them in front of goal.\nAlso, they are at home too so, if they need them, their fans can help to get them over the line.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nSasha's prediction: I want to back Fulham here, for south-west London. 0-3\nGoodison Park, 15:00 BST\nI am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live and I am really looking forward to going to Goodison Park again.\nEverything points towards a home win, despite Everton losing their previous two games. \nIpswich are definitely down now and, while they won't throw in the towel, they might be a little less spirited now they know they are relegated.\nTheir confidence has been sapped over the course of the season and, after watching them recently, I can't back them to get anything here. \nThey were flimsy against Arsenal, then well beaten by Newcastle, and it would be a shock if they scored at all, let alone break my record for the fastest goal scored by an away player at Goodison.\nEverton have stuttered in the past couple of weeks but I don't think that is a bad thing for David Moyes. \nHe has over-achieved since taking charge in January, when the reality is that he has got the same group of players as his predecessor, Sean Dyche, and there needs to be a lot of work done on improving that squad in the summer.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I am not sure if Ipswich will put up as much of a fight now they are relegated. 1-0\nKing Power Stadium, 15:00 BST\nLeicester have been rotten but, somehow, Southampton have been even worse.\nIt's sad to see Jamie Vardy leaving the Foxes at the end of the season, but maybe this might be the send-off he deserves. I am going with him to score the winner.\nThese two teams actually served up a thriller at St Mary's Stadium back in October, when Vardy got one of Leicester's goals as they fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\nI am expecting the same outcome here, just with a lot less excitement. The readers will go for a draw, I am sure of it, but I am pretty confident about Leicester taking this one.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nSasha's prediction: It's mad how bad both these teams have been. I don't think either of them will get a goal, let alone the win. 0-0\nEmirates Stadium, 17:30 BST\nWe know how dangerous Bournemouth are, because they beat Arsenal in October, and if Mikel Arteta rests players then this game becomes even harder for the Gunners.\nIt's a tricky situation for Arteta, because he will want to head to Paris St-Germain for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with a bit of momentum, but he has got to balance that with the risk of injury to his key players.\nBournemouth's form has improved of late, and the circumstances mean they definitely have a decent chance of doing the double over Arsenal this season.\nThis all boils down to what the Arsenal team is, so it is difficult to make a call without knowing that, but they are at home and even if they are not at full strength then I can still see them getting a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's a strange situation for Arsenal but I am still backing us to win. 2-0\nGtech Community Stadium, 14:00 BST\nWe know Manchester United are going to make changes here, because seeing out the second leg of their Europa League semi-final with Athletic Bilbao is their priority.\nRuben Amorim's side nicked a point at the very end of their game at Bournemouth last weekend, which sparked mass celebrations, but I really don't see them doing the same against Brentford - they won't be getting the bunting out this time.\nThe Bees are such a dangerous team when they come forward and they will keep on attacking United. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa should get plenty of chances and I can see them getting a goal or two between them.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I just have a feeling United will nick this. 0-1\nAmex Stadium, 14:00 BST\nBrighton got back to winning ways last weekend thanks to Carlos Baleba's brilliant late strike against West Ham.\nThe Seagulls beat Newcastle at St James' Park earlier in the season too, but that was before Eddie Howe's side hit their stride, and it is a big ask for Brighton to repeat that result.\nNewcastle were just relentless in their win over Ipswich and another three points here would be massive in their bid for a top-five finish - I don't think they will get them, but we will see a few goals.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2\nSasha's prediction: Newcastle will take this one. 0-2\nLondon Stadium, 14:00 BST\nThis is 17th versus 16th in the Premier League which tells you how bad both teams have been this season.\nEveryone knows Tottenham's focus will be on their Europa League semi-final second leg with Bodo/Glimt so I think West Ham boss Graham Potter needs a result here more than Ange Postecoglou.\nPotter's results have been poor since he took over from Julen Lopetegui in January and the Hammers fans have not had the upturn they wanted in the way their team play either.\nSpurs can still be dangerous even when they are out of form but Ange is not going to pick his strongest team. That gives West Ham a better chance of getting the win they badly need, but I don't see them doing it in style.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: I don't want to say Tottenham will win, but I think they will. 1-2\nStamford Bridge, 16:30 BST\nI would usually be asking which Chelsea side will turn up, but that applies to Liverpool too this week.\nArne Slot's side could have been out all week celebrating their title win and we don't know how that will affect them.\nYou often play at your best when you have been on the lash in a scenario like theirs. For example, some of my best games for Celtic came after nights out where we had won something and were allowed to have a couple of beers, but I don't know what to expect here.\nChelsea have nicked a couple of results recently, to stay in the race for the top five, but their performances have not been too convincing and their fans still don't seem to have taken to Enzo Maresca's playing style.\nThis is not the test for them that it would be if Liverpool were trying to close out the title but I don't think Slot is the type to let anyone take their foot off the gas. He will put out a strong team and even if they play with more freedom, I still think Liverpool will leave with the points.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nSasha's prediction: I still have a connection with Chelsea because of my stepdad and I have got to back them here. 3-0\nSelhurst Park, 20:00 BST\nCrystal Palace will be on a high after booking their place in the FA Cup final, so this is another very tricky game for Nottingham Forest, who slipped up at home against Brentford on Thursday.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side will have to be stubborn and resolute to get anything at Selhurst Park. They have shown that kind of character plenty of times already this season but they really need it now.\nLooking at the race for the top five you feel like every team involved needs to win every game, but of course that is not going to happen, and I can see my boyhood team Forest dropping more points here. I just hope it doesn't prove crucial for them.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's got to be Palace here. I am loyal to the London teams! 3-0\nChris got five correct results with one exact score from the nine Premier League games he predicted in week 34, giving him a total of 80 points.\nHe beat his guest, golf hero Lee Westwood, who got four correct results with no exact scores, leaving him on 40 points and tied with the BBC readers, who also got five correct results with one exact score.\nWestwood and the BBC readers were wrong about both FA Cup semi-finals, while Chris correctly picked City to beat Forest and wrongly thought Aston Villa would beat Crystal Palace. Those ties do not count towards the weekly totals.\nThe other game from week 34, Manchester City's 2-1 win over Aston Villa, took place on 22 April and does not count towards the weekly result either.\nSherelle, the guest in week 33, made the prediction instead of Westwood and picked up 40 points for the guests' overall total (but not her own individual tally) with an exact score.

He's ruining his own race. He's not racing very smart.\"\nPiastri wins from Norris in Miami to extend lead\n'Fire in my belly' led to team orders controversy - Hamilton\nChequered Flag podcast: Miami Grand Prix review\nNorris added: \"He probably could have finished third today, and he didn't because of that. So yeah, he's fighting, that is always expected, but that's what it is.\"\nVerstappen said: \"Honestly it's not frustrating at all (to lose a podium). We are here to win and today we were miles off that, so it doesn't really matter if you are a P3 or P4.\n\"I had nothing to lose, so I also just wanted to have a bit of fun out there.\"\nNorris lost out on a likely race win as a result of his first-lap incident with Verstappen.\nHe challenged the Red Bull on the outside of the first corner, and when Verstappen ran slightly deep, Norris cut back and tried to pass around the outside of the second corner.\nVerstappen took the racing line, appearing to flick his car towards Norris, and the McLaren went off the track into the run-off area and slipped to sixth.\nHad he backed off, Norris could have been the leading McLaren driver to attack Verstappen and given the car's dominant pace may well have won the race.\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"With the benefit of hindsight, let's say that considering the situation in corner one-two, it could have been better for Lando to just lift and make sure that he could keep the second position because the car, again, with the benefit of hindsight, we see that he was very fast and he would certainly have passed Max, like Oscar, and then later Lando was in condition to do.\n\"So I think like every situation in racing, you have to approach with the mindset of reviewing where the opportunities lie. And I think in this case, Lando could have been a little bit more patient.\"\nNorris was further delayed in racing Verstappen because he passed him at Turn 11 by going off track and had to give the place back, before regaining it for good the following lap.\nStella said he saw no difference in his two drivers' approaches to racing Verstappen.\n\"Both drivers were approaching the overtaking in a way that had Lando not gone off by a few centimetres in corner 11, he would have completed the overtaking in what was a similar time. So I don't think we should over-read too much into situations. I think it's, like I said before, it's a matter sometimes of a fraction of a second or a fraction of a metre.\n\"The big time loss came because of having to give back the position. So I think in terms of overtaking manoeuvre and precision and determination, I don't see that there's any difference between both drivers.\"\nOnce he passed Verstappen, Norris closed on Piastri in the second stint, but ran out of time to close the gap.\nMcLaren dominated in Miami with a one-two in the sprint and main race\nPiastri's win was his third in a row and fourth in six races and he leads Norris by 16 points in the championship, with Verstappen a further 16 adrift.\nThe Australian said: \"It was tough at the beginning trying to get past Max. I tried pretty hard to get past, with everything still on my car.\n\"It was not easy but I picked my moments when I needed to. I could tell that we had a lot of pace from the get-go today, and it was going to be a matter of when I got past, not if.\n\"But I wanted to do it as efficiently as I could because I knew once Lando got back behind me, he was going to be catching us a lot. I wanted to get through quickly but cleanly. I felt like I did a pretty good job of that, then built a gap. Maybe not the strongest second half of the race of my life, but I think building that gap and being quick at the right times was what I needed.\n\"It was a matter of just biding my time, waiting for a moment, or forcing him into a moment. That's what I was able to do. Once I got past, I knew I had to try and build a gap while Lando was behind him.

        "article_text": "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.\nThe Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.\nWith some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nBut this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.\n\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.\nHis community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.\n\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.\nThe Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.\nDespite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.\nIsagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.\nMr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.\n\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.\nHis community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.\n\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.\nThese concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.\n\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.\n\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"\nIn December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.\nOne factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.\nEDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.\nGuajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.\nAnd think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.\n\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.\nFor Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.\n\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.\nThis gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.\n\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"\nBy contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.\nWhile Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.\nFor energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.\nOne such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.\nThe company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.\nBut it says good community relations are not enough.\n\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"\nOn the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.\nEducation and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.\nSome people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.\nHis community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.\nDespite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.\nThe plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.\nWhile the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark.",

We should push a bit more in that second half, but we controlled the game and that is good.\"\nAmorim, however, is looking no further than the next game.\n\"Of course we are have an advantage,\" he said. \"We have our fans, but again this could change.\n\"Anything can happen in one game.\"",

        "article_text": "A second-hand Zelda cartridge. A cryptic forum thread. A generation of frightened children. This is the story of Ben Drowned \u2013 the internet's most infamous video game ghost.\nIt was Christmas Eve and 10-year-old Saarthak Johri couldn't sleep \u2013 but not because of excitement. He was shot through with fear. It was roughly a decade ago and Johri was a kid growing up in Saginaw, Michigan, in the US. He had spent the day slumped in an easy chair, staring at his phone, totally absorbed in an online urban myth. Johri knew it wasn't real, it couldn't be. And yet, he was powerless to get it out of his mind.\nHe had found a trail of old forum posts supposedly written by a college student. The student, who used the online pseudonym Jadusable, had bought a strange copy of a Nintendo 64 video game at a yard sale. It was The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, a notoriously dark instalment in the Zelda franchise, released 25 years ago this week on 27 April 2000.\nMajora's Mask is full of unnerving discussions about death, denial, fear, regret \u2013 and a looming apocalypse. But something was off about the cartridge Jadusable found. It had no label, just \"Majora\" scribbled on the plastic in marker. And something was seriously wrong with it.\nJadusable wrote that the game's familiar graphics were strange and distorted. Music played backwards in a spine-chilling loop. Worst of all, he was plagued by a terrifying statue of the main character, Link, with a petrified grimace on its face. It kept appearing in the game out of nowhere \u2013 like a digital ghost. On YouTube, Jadusable posted video evidence of everything he had described. This game cartridge, it seemed, was haunted \u2013 inhabited by the spirit of its former owner, a child named Ben who had drowned in a tragic accident. Johri pored over every detail, rapt with morbid curiosity.\nAs the story unfolded through roughly 11,000-words of forum entries posted over the course of weeks, Jadusable described a haunting that soon extended beyond the game to other areas of his life. Eventually, after a series of increasingly disturbing experiences, the forum posts ceased, and Jadusable was never heard from again. This urban legend burst onto the web in 2010, traumatising a generation of young internet users. It became known as \"Ben Drowned\".\nBen Drowned left an indelible mark on the web and continues to spawn art and fan fiction long after it emerged. Though lesser-known outside gaming circles, the story and its accompanying videos racked up millions of views and have inspired other narratives in a similar vein.\nAt its core, Ben Drowned is a story about a ghost in a machine \u2013 one that speaks to our deepest fears about new technology. But it's more than an effective urban legend. Ben Drowned is a myth born from a medium that shaped a generation. In an era when video games were still often seen as a frivolous pastime for children, Ben Drowned was early proof that society's relationship with video games goes beyond childhood nostalgia, tapping into our deepest emotions \u2013 and maybe even our souls.\nBy the time Johri stumbled on Ben Drowned in around 2015, it was already widely acknowledged as fiction. But that didn't matter. That night, on Christmas Eve, as Johri lay in bed wrestling with insomnia, he could see in his mind's eye that creepy statue's grimace projected onto the faces of his family members. Rumour had it that Ben, the ghost from the corrupted Majora's Mask cartridge, had gone on to torment other people besides Jadusable. That's what the adolescent Johri couldn't shake, however irrational it seemed. The idea that Ben's evil presence might be out there. That it could spread.\nYears earlier, in September 2010, a real-life college student called Alex Hall hit \"publish\" on a forum post that would change his life forever. Hall had just started his second year at Saint Louis University in Missouri, US. He wasn't a fan of college. Here was his first taste of freedom as a so-called adult, and yet there were still all these classes to attend. He dreamt of becoming a famous author.\nAt the time, content called \"copypastas\" had become popular on forums such as 4chan and Something Awful. The term refers to the practice of copying and pasting blocks of text online, an early means of going viral \u2013 if such text proved popular enough to be shared widely. Ben Drowned is a canonical entry in an influential subgenre of copypasta called \"creepypasta\" \u2013 horror stories whose origins often become obscured as they spread across the web, thus adding to the mystery. Slender Man, a legend that was eventually turned into a big budget movie, is probably the most famous example.\nBy 2010, creepypastas had become extremely popular. But few of these stories concerned video games \u2013 despite the significance of games as cultural artefacts by that point. There were some examples, though, such as Polybius \u2013 a story that spread online in the early 2000s about mythical arcade game said to be part of a US government conspiracy.\nHall decided that the internet was missing something: an in-depth, video game-themed creepypasta. Gradually, his idea began to form: a haunted cartridge, a series of hoax-like forum posts, a narrator targeted by the evil entity within the game, and videos to back up these claims.\nHall knew how to make such videos using software to mod (modify) a game. He chose to use that software on Majora's Mask, Hall's favourite at the time. \"That game, to me, felt like the most alive video game that I had ever played, really,\" he says. Characters talk at length about their grief, or express denial about their impending doom, even while the moon, which is on a collision course with the world, edges closer and closer overhead. \"They have hopes and dreams,\" adds Hall.\nThe tale Hall came up with developed and amplified the grim mood of Majora's Mask, using the game as a springboard for a folk story about a troubled gamer. Hall's narrative leans on ominous lines of dialogue from the game. Most notably: \"You shouldn't have done that.\"\nThe idea of a haunted Nintendo 64 cartridge came in part from Hall's own experience of trawling through yard sales for video games. He once found a copy of Star Wars Episode I: Racer, based on the pod-racing sequence from that film. \"I was so bad at that game,\" recalls Hall. But the copy he found had a complete save file on it from the previous owner, meaning he could play as all the racers without having to unlock them first. This planted the seed that old game cartridges sometimes harboured surprises.\n\"A big part of gamer culture has always been about finding the secrets in different games,\" says John Sanders, assistant professor of English who studies media and literature at Appalachian State University in North Carolina, US. But while gamers seek to master the games they play, Ben Drowned is about a nightmare opposite scenario \u2013 this is a game that will master you.\nSanders points out that people have long told stories about corrupted or haunted media. The possessed game cartridge is just the latest in a line that includes ghostly radio broadcasts, cursed videotapes and demonic books. In Ben Drowned, Hall dangled the possibility that Ben might be able to haunt the reader too, via their computer. Another age-old ghost story trope: you're next.\nAfter months of toil, Hall finally published his creation. A few days later, he woke up and logged on, bleary-eyed, to his YouTube channel. The first video he'd posted for the story had jumped up to nearly 2,000 views. Hall had never had such a response online before, and the view counter just kept ticking upwards. He picked up the phone and called his father. \"Dad,\" Hall croaked, \"I think I've done something here.\"\n\"I actually remember reading it in my dorm room in college and sending it to some of my friends,\" says Alexander Zawacki, a digital humanities lecturer at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in Germany, who describes the thrill of discovering creepypastas through links shared on internet forums. Readers felt as though they were \"getting into something a little bit secret\", he adds.\nZawacki is one of a few researchers who have published academic papers about Ben Drowned. It is a classic example of a spooky story that employs childhood nostalgia, he says \u2013 like horror films peppered with dolls, clowns and little children. \"They feel like relics of the past that come back to haunt you,\" says Zawacki.\nBen Drowned is a story that proves video games can be just as evocative.\nThat's significant, says Sanders. As video games matured, gaining more sophisticated graphics, complex characters and intricate storylines, they have given rise to entire subcultures \u2013 ardent gamers who trade knowledge about lore, cheat codes or hidden loot. They spend many hours exploring the digital worlds in the games they adore and sharing tales about the things they've seen that most people wouldn't believe.\nGamers' obsessions were leading to a \"boiling point\", adds Sanders, where a story like Ben Drowned had the chance of achieving real success.\nSanders also argues that Ben Drowned didn't just creep people out, it quite likely influenced later examples of urban legends about video games including Herobrine, a creepy, white-eyed character that supposedly appeared in Minecraft (but never actually did) and \"PBBV\", an evil spirit said to inhabit the virtual reality world of the game Gorilla Tag.\nThe creator of YouTube horror series Petscop, about a fictitious PlayStation One game that turns increasingly dark as the protagonist plays it, says he drew inspiration from Ben Drowned, among other sources.\nBen Drowned, which was first and foremost a text-based narrative complemented by video content, might seem anachronistic today. Zawacki says it's now more common to find stories like this presented in video-only formats.\nGaming writer and podcaster Marn Silverman, argues that while the delivery of Ben Drowned was \"of its time\", the story appears to have influenced a raft of video games built around the concept that they are possessed in one way or another \u2013 such as No Players Online, a supposedly haunted first-person shooter.\nIt's not surprising that a lot of these stories and games play on the nostalgia theme, says Emily Crawford, a digital media specialist in Washington DC who wrote about Ben Drowned while studying film and electronic media in graduate school. Games of the Nintendo 64 era, with their jagged, somewhat primitive 3D graphics, are especially good fodder for 21st Century ghost stories.\n\"The clunkier early technology left a lot more room for things to go wrong,\" Crawford says.\nTechnologies that are fallible have long given rise to anxiety and alarm. Ben Drowned is \"an articulation of the fears of the internet age\", says Sanders. \"Viruses, corruption, the blurring of the boundary between me at the computer and the computer itself.\"\nBen's desperation to haunt someone, and to spread to other people's computers via the internet, is a kind of demonic \"virality\", adds Sanders. It fits existing worries about the web and what we might find there, giving the concept an unsettling plausibility.\nFor many, experiences with Ben Drowned as a child were formative. Charlie Duke, a college student in the US, was around eight when he first heard about the story. He found a video about Ben Drowned and that, a mere summary of the original creepypasta, was enough to chill him to the bone.\n\"I immediately closed the video,\" he recalls. \"It got so stuck in my mind, it gave me anxiety for a long time.\" He even deleted a version of Majora's Mask he had on his computer, just to be safe. Duke says the ghost story played a significant role in debilitating anxiety attacks he suffered in the following years. He'd freeze up, hyperventilate and go completely pale. \"It was always looking for a trigger and Ben Drowned happened to be one of those triggers, or even the main one at the time.\"\nSaarthak Johri was also long-troubled by the story. The unnerving statue in the story that seemingly represented Ben's ghost, and the idea that he or his family members could be petrified in a similar way \"freaked me out so much\", he says.\nHall is aware that, for some people, Ben Drowned felt a little too real. \"That stuff sucks,\" he says, adding that accounts like Duke's have made him feel a little guilty at times. \"I want to tell people a story, I don't actually want to cause trauma.\"\nDespite the unpleasant experiences that Johri and Duke say they had after reading Ben Drowned, both have positive things to say about it today. \"It was kind of the first thing that connected me to other people in my middle school,\" says Johri. \"You have litmus tests for how online or digital people might be and knowing about these creepypastas is one of them.\"\nDuke says that Majora's Mask is one of his favourite games of all time. He has revisited Ben Drowned in the years since his first brush with the story and he notes that therapy has helped him to better understand and control his anxiety. \"It allowed me to look at myself in ways I don't think a lot of people my age [did],\" Duke says. \"I don't know if would thank Ben Drowned for that, but it definitely played a part.\"\nFor Hall, writing an internet ghost story has led to other ventures including a new YouTube series he plans to release later this year called Dead Save, featuring alternate versions of classic video games. As with Ben Drowned, he'll use modding tools to edit those original games and bring to life urban myths about them that have circled online. He also says he would love to release a playable version of the haunted Majora's Mask cartridge one day.\nBut, reflecting on Ben Drowned 15 years after its original publication, there's something else to consider. While ghost stories about technology and video games remain popular, Sanders points out that we are all, these days, very used to the idea that there could be some malevolent actor trying to control our computer or harm us through our devices. Whether that's an email scam, social media bots, ransomware or people targeting us with disinformation or abusive content.\nThe threat lurking within technology isn't demonic, it's us. The \"fantastic\" supernaturalism of Ben Drowned seems almost quaint in comparison.\n\"Now we're just like, 'Oh yeah, it's out there, there are Bens out there waiting to happen, waiting to control our computers',\" says Sanders. \"We just don't think they're fantastic anymore.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A new type of tobacco product is finding growing numbers of users around the world, but there are still serious questions about how it affects human health.\nHaving smoked for nearly 30 years since the age of 13, IT consultant and freelance writer Ben Taylor was intrigued by the sound of heated tobacco products.\nAttempting to switch from cigarettes to vapes hadn't worked for Taylor. \"Vaping liquids always left me wanting,\" he posted on his blog. So he decided to try IQOS, a sleek, pen-shaped electronic device that heats sticks of rolled tobacco, developed by the American multinational tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI).\nRather than burning tobacco, these devices heat it to a temperature high enough to create a vapour but not smoke.\nFor Taylor, it didn't quite replicate the experience of smoking a cigarette, but it came much closer than vaping \u2013 the other popular cigarette alternative, which uses handheld pens to heat a flavoured nicotine-containing liquid. \"You can tell you're consuming real tobacco,\" Taylor wrote. Over time, he says, he came to prefer IQOS due to the taste, and the lack of a lingering cigarette stench. He also says his previously near-permanent cough disappeared.\nTobacco manufacturers that sell heated tobacco devices market them as being a less harmful alternative to cigarettes. They point to industry-funded research that shows they produce lower levels of compounds known to be harmful to human health.\nBut there is growing concern in the medical community that these devices still pose a health risk to both the people who use them and those standing nearby. They also warn that as relatively new products, the long-term effects of using heated tobacco have still to be properly investigated.\nYet they are also becoming increasingly common, with next-generation heated tobacco products now available in more than 60 countries. They have experienced particularly notable growth in both\u00a0Italy and Japan,\u00a0where they have been present since 2014. And this growth is expected to continue as they start to penetrate the market in the US.\nSo, is heated tobacco really helping people enjoy nicotine in a less harmful way, or could it be a new public health crisis in the making?\nIQOS and other devices like it are the latest iteration of a concept which the tobacco industry has been intermittently toying with for the past four decades. In 1988, an American tobacco company called RJ Reynolds\u00a0attempted to commercialise the very first heated tobacco product, a device called Premier. Designed to look similar to a conventional cigarette in shape and size, the Premier had a specifically designed carbon tip that users would light to heat the tobacco. But despite a reported $300m (roughly \u00a3180m at the time) in investment, Premier\u00a0was removed from the market\u00a0after just six months as users complained about its taste and smell.\nAfter various reinventions, heated tobacco products have started to enjoy commercial success in the past decade with a new range of electronic devices that use several methods to vaporise their contents. Typically these involve encasing tobacco in either sticks, plugs, capsules or pods, which are then heated with an electronic element. As well as PMI's IQOS, leading brands include Ploom, made by Japan Tobacco International (JTI), and glo, made by British American Tobacco (BAT).\nEmploying sleek, appealing designs and backed by\u00a0multi-million dollar marketing strategies \u2013 which have included everything from social media influencers\u00a0to pop-up stores \u2013 these devices have been far more successful than the original incarnations. Celebrities\u00a0have backed heated tobacco products, with the\u00a0musician Jamiroquai and actors Alberto Amman and Monica Cruz attending the IQOS 3 launch party in Madrid in 2019. Jamiroquai also performed at\u00a0a 2018 launch event\u00a0for IQOS 3 in Milan, while American dance music DJ Steve Aoki, whose name is attached to a limited edition version of an IQOS device,\u00a0performed a concert at another event for the products in Barcelona in January 2025.\nBAT have also\u00a0employed similar marketing tactics, paying social media influencers, sponsoring boat parties and organising giveaways at Formula 1 races.\nSo far, heated tobacco products have had limited penetration in the US. While one survey of 40,000 US adults found that 8% were aware of them, only 0.5% had ever used one of the devices. But that could change. After first receiving a\u00a0limited authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019, which was later extended in 2020, IQOS is\u00a0now re-entering\u00a0the US market in Austin, Texas.\nThe tobacco industry\u00a0promotes this new generation of heated tobacco products as a safer, smoke-free alternative, stressing that they only heat, not burn tobacco. PMI's website, for example,\u00a0states\u00a0that they aim to remove \"combustion of tobacco, the cause of most tobacco-related diseases\", celebrating IQOS as \"the next step in tobacco harm reduction\". The company\u00a0estimates that more than 22 million adults\u00a0globally have quit smoking cigarettes and switched to its heated tobacco products.\nPMI has said in the past that it intends to stop selling cigarettes and become a smoke-free company. It is investing heavily in products such as heated tobacco and hopes for at least two-thirds of its revenues to come from smoke-free products by 2030.\u00a0\nBut independent researchers and public health experts argue that heated tobacco products are still harmful to human health and urge users to give up tobacco altogether. They express concerns at some of the marketing strategies, saying that the use of influencers and glamorous launch parties could encourage heated tobacco use among young people, who are more likely not to have smoked before, which could make these products a gateway to cigarettes.\u00a0\nPMI, JTI and BAT all insist their products are aimed at adults only. PMI says it has a robust code of conduct that does not allow marketing that appeals to minors such as cartoons, youth-orientated celebrities or models who are or appear to be under the age of 25. BAT said they carry out due diligence on any influencer partnerships to ensure that a significant majority of their followers are over 18 years old. JTI says it is \"committed to the principle that minors should never use or access nicotine-containing products\". It says it ensures it markets its heated tobacco products in a \"socially responsible way\" in accordance with applicable laws and rules.\nBut Silvano Gallus, an epidemiologist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, believes that existing smokers do not appear to be the main audience for these products, despite the messaging from tobacco firms. He first started monitoring the rollout of heated tobacco products more than a decade ago.\n\"We began to see the promotion of these products everywhere with advertisements, events and parties, particularly aimed at young people,\" says Gallus, reflecting on the initial launch of heated tobacco in the cities of Milan and Nagoya, Japan.\u00a0\nIn 2019, PMI suspended a social media campaign involving digital influencers after the news organisation Reuters revealed the company had been using young online personalities to market its products, including a 21-year-old woman, in breach of its own code of conduct. PMI said at the time that no laws were broken, but acknowledged that the campaign failed to meet the company's standards.\nGallus claims that the users of heated tobacco products in Italy tend to be young, pointing to surveys which have described their use as widespread among adolescents. \"They aren't 60-year-old hardcore smokers looking for an alternative to cigarettes,\" he says.\u00a0\nPMI, however, insists that unintended use among youths is low in the 70 markets where IQOS is currently available. It points to a survey in 2021 funded by the Japanese government that showed 0.9% of those questioned in junior high school (aged 13-15) and 1.4% of those in high school (aged 16-18) said they used heated tobacco. It is illegal to smoke or buy tobacco in Japan under the age of 20. Other studies in countries around the world show use among youths is in the low single digits, PMI says.\nBut there is concern among public health experts that if young people who have never smoked cigarettes really are drawn to heated tobacco products, it could introduce new groups of people to potentially harmful habits.\nIn 2024, Gallus and a group of fellow tobacco control researchers in Italy published a study based on data from more than 3,000 Italians aged between 18 and 74, who they tracked for six months during 2020. They found that non-smokers who began using heated tobacco products were 5.8 times as likely to subsequently transition to smoking within the six month study period as people who had never used heated tobacco products.\n\"We know that this product is a gateway to conventional cigarettes,\" says Gallus. It is a concern shared by other researchers.\nBut PMI describes Gallus' study as unreliable and says that heated tobacco can provide a route out of smoking. Gallus and his colleagues acknowledge themselves that their study had a limited sample size and needs to be verified with larger studies. The results may also have been impacted by the pandemic and widespread lockdowns which were taking place at the time.\nResearchers like Gallus, however, view heated tobacco products as a setback in the battle to drive down tobacco use and have accused the industry of cynically targeting young people. They point to the fact that, to date, marketing for IQOS has appeared at music festivals and film festivals in Europe, Asia and South America, alongside high profile partnerships with streetwear brands and fashion designers.\nIt is a concern echoed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In a\u00a02023 summary of evidence, experts at the WHO\u00a0warned that the lower cost of heated tobacco sticks compared to a pack of cigarettes \"undermines the progress made in reducing use that was accomplished by making products more expensive\". The report, which was funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organisation that invests heavily in reducing tobacco use, added that the marketing of heated tobacco products often combined claims of reduced harm relative to cigarettes with \"the passion for technology of primarily young people\".\nAccording to a report produced by the non-profit organisation Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids \u2013 which also receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies \u2013 influencer-driven campaigns on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube have also played a key role in raising the visibility of IQOS and other heated tobacco brands. A study by researchers at the University of Rochester in the US also found that Instagram posts featuring heated tobacco products often position the devices as lifestyle products by showing them alongside models, swimming pools or a luxury car. Posts with models or lifestyle elements received higher engagement.\u00a0\nPMI categorically denies marketing its heated tobacco products to young people and says it does not have an official account on TikTok, while its account on X is used for customer care only. The company also says at least 75% of the audience must be over the legal age for purchasing tobacco products at any third-party events it sponsors. PMI claims 82% of IQOS users are over the age of 29, according to its own estimates.\nBut the debate over the marketing of heated tobacco also obscures another issue \u2013 these products are so new that there is still little research to assess their long-term health effects.\nMost research on the vapour emissions from heated tobacco products have been funded by tobacco companies or carried out by scientists directly employed by them. They show that heated tobacco aerosols contain significantly fewer harmful compounds than cigarette smoke.\nSome studies have also found that switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco can be beneficial in some people \u2013 such as patients with chronic lung disease. But other scientific research also suggests that heated tobacco products are unlikely to be benign for our health.\u00a0\nIn 2017, a group of Swiss scientists published a study disputing one of PMI's central marketing claims, namely that IQOS is smoke-free because of the lack of combustion or burning of the tobacco leaves.\u00a0\nInstead, the researchers argue that the emissions from heated tobacco devices should still be considered as \"smoke\" and should fall under indoor smoking bans in the same way as cigarettes. Their study showed that IQOS tobacco reaches around 330C (626F), a finding supported by other studies, while a conventional cigarette reached around 684C (1,263F).\nIn their subsequent analysis of IQOS emissions, they concluded that the heated tobacco vapour also contained harmful chemicals which stem from pyrolysis \u2013 the term for incomplete combustion \u2013 and thermogenic degradation, making it more similar to cigarette smoke than the company was claiming. \"Smokers and non-smokers need accurate information about toxic compounds released in IQOS smoke,\" the scientists wrote.\u00a0\nPMI was quick to respond to the study, sending the authors a letter disputing many of the results. A subsequent analysis by the FDA also warned there were \"significant analytical issues\" with the study that made it difficult to compare the levels of harmful and potentially harmful compounds from heated tobacco to those from cigarettes. PMI maintains that IQOS heats tobacco but does not burn it.\nOther research, however, has examined the type and quantity of toxins present in the vapours produced by heated tobacco.\nAt the National Technical University of Athens, chemical engineer Efthimios Zervas has spent much of the past decade painstakingly analysing the chemicals present in the fumes of products including IQOS and glo. He describes it as a slow and complex process because the fumes emitted contain many thousands of different chemicals, in combinations that vary greatly from one product to another.\u00a0\n\"We try to study as much as we can, but it's difficult because as soon as we publish our results, this product we've been analysing has either been modified or is no longer on the market,\" he says. \"So you're constantly playing catch-up with the industry.\"\nStill, Zervas has drawn a number of conclusions. As with cigarettes, he has found that heated tobacco products release high concentrations of fine particles, capable of penetrating deep into the body. Other studies have identified known toxins present in the gaseous emissions. Indeed, many toxins and carcinogens were present at far lower concentrations in heated tobacco vapours than in fumes from cigarettes. But Zervas has found others, such as carbonyl methylglyoxal, that he says are actually emitted in higher concentrations by heated tobacco products.\u00a0\n\"There are toxic products in there, so we cannot say that these devices are safe,\" says Zervas.\nPMI says that its own research indicates that IQOS does not generate solid particles in the aerosol it emits.\nIndustry-backed studies have also reported a long list of compounds in the aerosols from heated tobacco \u2013 one study by BAT found more than 120 while another detected 205 compounds in the aerosols, including 82 not seen in cigarette smoke. These include compounds that are the result of heating glycerol, which is one of the ingredients in heated tobacco sticks. The WHO has called for more research to evaluate the effect of these compounds on human health when inhaled at the relatively high levels in heated tobacco aerosols.\nMeanwhile early studies in animals indicate that there may be some long-term effects of heated tobacco on cardiovascular health and the central nervous system, but these results are yet to be seen in humans.\nSuch sentiments have been noted by regulators. While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised PMI to market multiple heated tobacco products, it also declared that this \"does not mean these products are safe nor FDA approved\". The FDA also says, \"There are no safe tobacco products, so those who do not currently use tobacco products, especially young people, should not start.\"\nAll three of the tobacco companies the BBC spoke to acknowledge that it would be incorrect to say heated tobacco products are safe or risk free. But they say research indicates that they provide a way of reducing exposure to harmful compounds if smokers switch from cigarettes to heated tobacco products.\n\"This fundamental principle underpins the promise that smoke-free products like IQOS hold for advancing global health and further validates PMI's commitment to a smoke-free future,\" says Moira Gilchrist, PMI's global chief communications officer.\n\"The majority of risk associated with cigarettes comes from the burning of tobacco and not the nicotine,\" says a BAT spokesperson. \"glo, while not risk free, does not involve burning tobacco.\" Footnotes in their response, however, added that their statement assumes a complete switch from cigarette smoking and notes that their product is addictive and not risk free.\n\"JTI does not market any of its products including heated tobacco products as smoking cessation products,\" says a JTI spokesperson. \"They are an alternative for smokers looking for products with the potential to reduce the risks associated with smoking.\"\u00a0\nThere are some who question the science that major companies are using to promote heated tobacco products. The European Respiratory Society Tobacco Control Committee published a position paper in February 2024 on the subject. The paper states that, while the tobacco industry claims a 90-95% reduction in harmful and potentially harmful substances and toxicity for heated tobacco products, this is not the full picture. Independent research shows these products emit substantial levels of carcinogenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, irritants and potential carcinogens, as well as similar nicotine and tar levels to a standard cigarette, the paper states.\nSome researchers have also cast doubt on the clinical trials conducted by tobacco companies themselves. In 2022, a systematic review by the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group \u2013 which receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies and are part of STOP, a global tobacco industry watchdog \u2013 concluded that PMI's clinical trials of its heated tobacco products were of poor quality and at high risk of bias.\u00a0\nPMI did not provide a response to these allegations when asked by the BBC, but it characterised the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group as an \"unreliable and inaccurate source of information\". It did not provide any further evidence to support this accusation.\nWith other forms of smokeless tobacco also on the rise, which can be chewed, sucked or snuffed, many anti-tobacco lobbyists are frustrated by the lack of progress. Staying ahead of the proliferation of new forms of tobacco consumption is like playing a game of \"whack-a-mole\", says Sandra Mullin, senior vice-president of policy, advocacy and communication at Vital Strategies, an international non-profit organisation that has partnered with governments around the world to develop tobacco control policies.\n\"I was in China in January, and they showed us these new models of heated tobacco products that don't look like tobacco, they look like a toy,\" she says, adding that she would like to have more data that demonstrates whether there are serious health impacts from such products.\nOne aspect that is particularly worrying public health officials, including the WHO, is that these devices may actually encourage people to consume more tobacco. A 2022 systematic review by researchers in the UK concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show they help people to stop smoking. The 2023 WHO report on heated tobacco also warns that the available data indicates that most smokers become dual users and \"do not substantially reduce their risk from tobacco products\".\nGallus and his colleagues recently published a review of 26 studies on the use of heated tobacco products conducted around the world since 2022. Two out of three heated tobacco users are dual users, he and his colleagues concluded.\nAccording to Gallus, dual users have a significantly higher risk of disease and premature death compared with smokers.\n\"If you're not actually reducing tobacco consumption, it undoes any potential reduced harm effects, and the industry's just making money from people twice over,\" says Sophie Braznell, a researcher in the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group and a spokesperson for STOP.\nPMI claims its own data demonstrates the majority of IQOS users have given up smoking. It estimates 72% of IQOS users are people who have fully switched from cigarettes. JTI and BAT did not respond to questions about dual use of their products.\nBut with IQOS returning to the US, starting with the devices going on sale in Austin, Texas in March 2025, Yolonda Richardson, president and chief executive of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, is concerned that more people will become users of multiple tobacco or nicotine products. E-cigarettes\u00a0remain popular among younger people while nicotine pouches that are placed between the lip and gum are now showing signs of growing in popularity, with the CDC reporting a substantial increase in nationwide sales in the US since 2016.\nHowever, Richardson says that it may take a long time before the full health consequences become apparent. When they do, it will be exceedingly difficult to pinpoint the underlying source, as individuals will have been exposed to different concentrations of nicotine in different forms, as well as varying sources of tobacco.\nZervas argues that the onus should be on the tobacco industry to prove that its products are not dangerous before they're able to enter the market, rather than the other way round.\n\"It's like with food or drugs,\" he says. \"We study them first and, if they're safe, we allow them. With the tobacco industry's products, we allow them into the market and then have to prove they're dangerous, or very dangerous.\"\n* This article was updated on 2 May 2025 to make clear that the FDA issued additional authorisation for IQOS to be marketted in the US in 2020.\n--\u00a0\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The FDA also says, \"There are no safe tobacco products, so those who do not currently use tobacco products, especially young people, should not start. The 2023 WHO report on heated tobacco also warns that the available data indicates that most smokers become dual users and \"do not substantially reduce their risk from tobacco products\".Gallus and his colleagues recently published a review of 26 studies on the use of heated tobacco products conducted around the world since 2022. Other studies in countries around the world show use among youths is in the low single digits, PMI says.But there is concern among public health experts that if young people who have never smoked cigarettes really are drawn to heated tobacco products, it could introduce new groups of people to potentially harmful habits.In 2024, Gallus and a group of fellow tobacco control researchers in Italy published a study based on data from more than 3,000 Italians aged between 18 and 74, who they tracked for six months during 2020. \"JTI does not market any of its products including heated tobacco products as smoking cessation products,\" says a JTI spokesperson.",

Officials had initially described that exemption as temporary, but after customs instructions issued this week analysts said it now appeared likely to stick.\nTrump this week also signed measures to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, while setting up a two-year system carmakers can use to reduce the duties they have to pay on parts imported from other countries and used in US-assembled cars.\nThe administration had also already said firms importing cars made in Canada and Mexico would not be charged tariffs on US-made content. \n\"The changes that have come in the last couple of days are going to make it easier ... but even so it's still a dramatic change to the market,\" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. \"It's still a big tariff.\"\nExecutives at some firms have said they are exploring ways to increase production in the US to mitigate the new costs. \nGeneral Motors said it had expanded truck production at its factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana, by about 50,000 as a result of the tariffs. This week it also said it would cut back output in Canada.\nMercedes also said it had flexibility to expand at its factory in Alabama.\nArt Wheaton, director of Labor Studies at Cornell University, said the US might see more such announcements in the months ahead, but he did not expect to see new factories getting built anytime soon, given the significance of that investment and how fast the situation is changing. \n\"If I'm going to make a multi-billion dollar decision... I wouldn't do it in a market that is this unstable,\" he said.\nThe administration has said it is working on trade deals with key countries for the industry, including South Korea and Japan.\nTrump might also modify his policies if signs of economic damage start to emerge, Mr Wheaton said.\n\"Everything is pretty good now,\" he said. \"I don't think the full impact of those tariffs has hit yet.\"",

A drone then bombed a local market, MSF said.\nThe hospital is the only one in Fangak county, which has a population of more than 110,000 people, MSF said, and all its medical supplies were destroyed. \nThe charity called the attack, which left 20 people injured, a \"clear violation of international humanitarian law\".\nMSF spokesman Mamman Mustapha told the BBC's Newshour programme the charity was still trying to establish the facts, but local witnesses had said the aircraft were \"government forces helicopters\".\n\"The hospital is clearly marked as 'hospital' with our logo,\" he said. \"We have shared also our coordinates for all the warring parties in the area so the hospital should be known to both parties as a hospital.\"\nThere was no immediate comment from South Sudan's government. The BBC has contacted the foreign affairs ministry.\nIn recent weeks, Nicholas Haysom, who leads the UN mission in South Sudan, has warned the country is \"teetering on the brink of a return to full-scale civil war\".\nThose worries have been stoked by an escalating feud between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar.\nHours before the hospital bombing, the head of the army, Paul Majok Nang, promised punitive strikes after several barges on a river were hijacked.\nHe blamed those attacks on a militia linked to Vice-President Machar, who has not commented on the claim.\nMachar was arrested in March along with several of his associates, and accused of trying to stir up a rebellion.\nThe government has recently listed counties it considers to be hostile - in other words allied to Machar. \nThat increased the suspicion that South Sudan could be headed for another conflict involving the country's two largest ethnic groups.\nSouth Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 but two years later, a civil war erupted when President Kiir dismissed Machar as vice-president, accusing him of plotting a coup.\nThe ensuing conflict, largely fought along ethnic lines between supporters of the two leaders, resulted in an estimated 400,000 deaths and 2.5 million people being forced from their homes \u2013 more than a fifth of the population.\nA peace deal was reached in 2018 and a unity government forged with the same two men at the helm, but elections that were supposed to have been called since then have not happened.\nThe peace deal was also meant to see the end of all the militias and the formation of one united army \u2013 but that has not happened and many armed groups are still loyal to different politicians.\nThe current crisis was sparked earlier this year when the White Army militia, which was allied to Machar during the civil war, clashed with the army in Upper Nile state and overran a military base in Nasir.\nThen, in March, a UN helicopter attempting to evacuate troops came under fire, leaving several dead, including a high-ranking army general.\nRights groups have been calling for the military to stop bombing civilian areas.\nAdditional reporting by Yemisi Adegoke & Nichola Mandil\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "The Duke of Sussex has told the BBC he \"would love a reconciliation\" with the Royal Family, in an emotional interview in which he said he was \"devastated\" at losing a legal challenge over his security in the UK.\nPrince Harry said the King \"won't speak to me because of this security stuff\", but that he did not want to fight any more and did \"not know how much longer my father has\".\nThe prince spoke to BBC News in California after losing an appeal over the levels of security he and his family are entitled to while in the UK.\nBuckingham Palace said: \"All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\"\nAfter Friday's court ruling, the prince said: \"I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point.\"\n\"There have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family,\" he added, but had now \"forgiven\" them.\n\"I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious,\" said Prince Harry, who said the dispute over his security had \"always been the sticking point\".\nThe prince had wanted to overturn changes to his security that were introduced in 2020 as he stepped down as a working royal and moved to the United States.\nSaying that he felt \"let down\", he described his court defeat as a \"good old fashioned establishment stitch up\" and blamed the Royal Household for influencing the decision to reduce his security.\nAsked whether he had asked the King to intervene in the dispute over security, Prince Harry said: \"I never asked him to intervene - I asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their jobs.\"\nThe prince said his treatment during the process of deciding his security had \"uncovered my worst fears\".\nHe said of the decision: \"I'm devastated - not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay. Is it a win for them?\" \nHe continued: \"I'm sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win.\"\nPrince Harry said the decision to remove his automatic security entitlement impacts him \"every single day\", and has left him in a position where he can only safely return to the UK if invited by the Royal Family - as he would get sufficient security in those circumstances.\nThe prince said changes to his security status had impacted not just him, but his wife and, later, his children too.\nHe went on to say: \"Everybody knew that they were putting us at risk in 2020 and they hoped that me knowing that risk would force us to come back. \n\"But then when you realise that didn't work, do you not want to keep us safe?\n\"Whether you're the government, the Royal Household, whether you're my dad, my family - despite all of our differences, do you not want to just ensure our safety?\"\nAsked whether he missed the UK, he replied: \"I love my country, I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done... and I think that it's really quite sad that I won't be able to show my children my homeland.\"\nPrince Harry said he would not be seeking a further legal challenge as Friday's ruling had \"proven that there was no way to win this through the courts\". \n\"I wish someone had told me that beforehand,\" he said, adding that the ruling had been a \"surprise\".\nHe continued: \"This, at the heart of it, is a family dispute, and it makes me really, really sad that we're sitting here today, five years later, where a decision that was made most likely, in fact I know, to keep us under the roof.\"\nFriday's ruling was the result of Prince Harry's latest legal challenge against the UK government over the level of security he and his family are entitled to when visiting.\nThe Court of Appeal said that while Prince Harry had made \"powerful\" arguments about the level of threat he and his family face, his \"sense of grievance\" did not \"translate into a legal argument\".\nHis legal complaint centred around the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec) committee - which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office - and its decision to remove his eligibility for the automatic, full-scale protection other senior royals receive.\nUnder the committee's regulations, Prince Harry argued, his case should have been put before Ravec's Risk Management Board (RMB), which would have assessed the threats to his and family's security - but that did not happen.\nOn Friday, senior judges said the committee had diverged from policy when making its 2020 decision over the prince's security, but concluded it had been \"sensible\" to do so because of the complexity of his circumstances. \nPrince Harry said his \"jaw hit the floor\" when he found out a representative of the Royal Household sat on the Ravec committee, and claimed Friday's ruling had proved its decision-making process was more influenced by the Royal Household than by legal constraints.\nHe claimed there had been \"interference\" by the Royal Household in the 2020 decision, which he said resulted in his status as the most at-risk royal being downgraded to the least at risk \"overnight\". \n\"So one does question how that is even possible and also the motive behind that at the time,\" he added.\nPrince Harry called on UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to intervene in his security case, and to overhaul how the Ravec committee operates.\nIn a statement released later on Friday, the prince said he would write to Cooper to \"ask her to urgently examine the matter and review the Ravec process\".\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said the department was \"pleased\" that the judgement had been in the government's favour.\nThey added: \"The UK government's protective security system is rigorous and proportionate. \n\"It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.\"\nAdditional reporting by Sean Seddon\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

There's no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious,\" said Prince Harry, who said the dispute over his security had \"always been the sticking point\".Prince Harry loses legal challenge over securitySix key moments from Prince Harry's BBC interviewThe prince had wanted to overturn changes to his security that were introduced in 2020 as he stepped down as a working royal and moved to the United States.Saying that he felt \"let down\", he described his court defeat as a \"good old fashioned establishment stitch up\" and blamed the Royal Household for influencing the decision to reduce his security.Asked whether he had asked the King to intervene in the dispute over security, Prince Harry said: \"I never asked him to intervene - I asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their jobs.",

Last year, we were waiting to see what Leinster were going to do.\n\"We showed up today and the first 20 minutes, we punched them in the face. They weren't really expecting that. Credit to the boys, we got the result.\"\nConfidence in Leinster reaching a fourth consecutive final from fans and pundits alike was well-founded.\nThe Irish province pitched up at their vociferous Dublin home without having conceded a point in thumping knockout victories over Harlequins and United Rugby Championship title-holders Glasgow Warriors.\nSaints, though, had not read the script. \nEngland wing Tommy Freeman scored a first-half hat-trick to extend his tally to seven tries in three Champions Cup appearances and further strengthen his claim for British and Irish Lions selection, while Henry Pollock's star continues to rise after his searing try.\nThe hosts responded after half-time, but, somewhat uncharacteristically, lacked the clinical edge to regain the lead, while Saints were able to negate Leinster's blitz defence once more as James Ramm scored their fifth try.\nIreland wing James Lowe dragged his side to within three points to set up a thrilling finale but, after referee Pierre Brousset awarded Leinster a late penalty instead of a try, Northampton salvaged possession with a last-gasp turnover camped on their own line before kicking the ball dead.\nSaints director of rugby Phil Dowson was a member of the playing squad the last time the club overcame Leinster in 2013, but the former back row's masterminding of their latest victory is perhaps the greatest of his coaching career.\n\"Lots of people wrote us off and we understood we were underdogs but the belief within the group was outstanding,\" Dowson told BBC Radio Northampton. \n\"I would hate to think what my blood pressure was doing at the end but the last defensive set spoke volumes about our group, about the lads coming on and their impact. We got the turnover, killed the clock and cue the wild scenes in the coaching box.\n\"We have had experience before of playing into a press defence.

I have never played in a game that hard in my life,\" Pollock told Premier Sports.\n\"That is what dreams are made of. \n\"As a boy I grew up watching this competition and to get to the final with my boyhood club, I'm emotional speaking about it. \n\"After the last two performances these Leinster boys had, to come here with no fear, we have been saying all week, 'Why not us?'.\"\nPollock's all-round performance belied his level of experience, while his try demonstrated the physical prowess of a back as he launched on to Mitchell's flat pass from a standing start to glide through a hole in Leinster's defence, before sprinting around final defender Sam Prendergast.\nAsked about applying two fingers to his neck in celebration, an enthused Pollock added: \"I was just feeling that pulse. \n\"This is why you play the game, because you love it.

        "article_text": "The return of Marvel, Final Destination and Mission: Impossible franchises are among this month's unmissable films to watch and stream.\nCobra Kai began life as a YouTube series which picked up from where the 40-year-old Karate Kid franchise left off. In short, it didn't sound like essential viewing. But the series went on to be an Emmy-nominated, critically acclaimed, six-season hit, and it put the star of the 1984 film, Ralph Macchio, back in the limelight. Now Macchio is starring in a Karate Kid sequel, Karate Kid Legends, featuring Ben Wang as the new Kid on the block, a Chinese teenager who learns to fight bullies in New York. Confusingly, Legends follows the continuity of the original Karate Kid films, as well as the Cobra Kai series, but it also brings in Jackie Chan's Mr Han, who was in the 2010 Karate Kid remake. Still, Macchio promises that all the elements in this shared universe will be in balance \u2013 and as Mr Miyagi once explained, \"Balance is key\". \"Once we were able to line that up, for the Cobra Kai story to lead into the new film \u2013 even though they're separate ecosystems \u2013 it all made sense for me,\" Macchio said in Variety. \"Then, working with Jackie was just super exciting. I started this on the big screen. How cool is it to get it back to the big screen?\"\nReleased on 28, 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally\nDanny and Michael Philippou are the Australian twins who made Talk to Me, a terrifically creepy indie horror film which was an international hit in 2023. It was such a success, in fact, that you might have expected the Philippous to move straight onto a sequel, or even to a Hollywood blockbuster. Instead, the brothers stayed in their hometown of Adelaide and made another low-budget horror film with an original story: Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a foster mother, Laura, who is trying to contact the dead. Thematically, this supernatural chiller is closely related to Talk to Me, although it's been given extra depth by a death in the Philippou family.\u00a0\"We were doing pre-production meetings, then we started shooting, and there was no time to properly sort through those emotions,\" Danny Philippou said in Den of Geek. \"They sort of poured themselves out in the script and in conversations with Sally, so that bled into the character of Laura and scenes that were meant to be scary suddenly turned sad. I think there's a rawness in it that wasn't in Talk to Me.\"\nReleased on 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally\nThe co-director of Deaf President Now!, Nyle DiMarco, says that his documentary tells \"the story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of\". Its setting is Gallaudet University in Washington DC, the world's first university for deaf and hard of hearing students. Gallaudet was established in 1864, but for more than a century, none of its presidents was deaf. In 1988, when the board of trustees appointed yet another hearing president over two deaf candidates, the students wouldn't stand for it. Eight days of protests followed \u2013 and four of the protesters are interviewed in the film. Co-directed by Davis Guggenheim, who made the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and Still: A Michael J Fox Movie, Deaf President Now! is \"a firebrand historical documentary that is as crowd-pleasing and informative as it is innovative and inclusive\", says Marya E Gates at RobertEbert.com.\nReleased on 16 May on Apple+ internationally\nThere were five Final Destination films from 2000 to 2011, all with the same structure. First, there would be a spectacular catastrophe; then this sequence would be revealed to be someone's premonition; then the person who had the premonition would save a handful of people from the catastrophe when it actually happened; but then those people would be claimed by Death, one by one, usually via complicated accidents. Now the gleefully grisly franchise is back from the dead, so prepare to squeal and squirm at yet more ingeniously nasty killings. But Final Destination: Bloodlines has moved on from the previous films in one respect. According to the trailer, it turns out that all of the victims in the previous five films were descended from people who were saved from one particular catastrophe, decades ago. That means that the film isn't just about a group of strangers, but a family that is trying to break an inherited curse. \"Suddenly, the five films are not just one fun, gory rollercoaster ride after another, but a series with a lot of interweaving emotional weight,\" says Shawn Van Horn in Collider. \"Those stronger relationships are going to make the characters more three-dimensional, and we'll likely be rooting for their survival rather than relishing in the bloodshed.\" Well\u2026 maybe.\nReleased on 14, 15 and 16 May in cinemas internationally\nIn 2018, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour finished with Blake Lively's glamorous killer being jailed for 20 years, and with Anna Kendrick's widowed mother finding fame as a crime-solving vlogger, so a sequel didn't seem likely. But the film prided itself on its outrageous plot twists, so maybe it's appropriate that, seven years on, Lively's character is not just free from prison, but is about to marry a wealthy Italian on the island of Capri \u2013 and she is determined that her old frenemy should be her maid of honour. A Simple Favour was a devilish comedy noir that treated viewers to deceit, betrayal, murder, and the sight of Lively sipping martinis while wearing absurdly stylish outfits. Another Simple Favour is even more lavish in its fashions, and even more head-spinning in its plotting. Kristy Puchko in Mashable calls it a \"shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humour, relish in mob drama [and] plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre\". Fans of the first film will \"cherish this divinely twisted thriller\".\u00a0\nReleased on 1 May on Prime Video internationally\nTim Robinson, a Saturday Night Live alumnus with his own sketch show, Netflix's I Think You Should Leave, has his first big-screen leading role in Friendship. And, true to form, it will make you cringe as much as laugh. Robinson plays Craig, a suburban office worker who is too awkward to have any real friends. Then he meets his neighbour, Brian (Paul Rudd), a weatherman who plays in a punk band in his spare time, which makes him fabulously cool by Craig's standards. Craig is thrilled to hang out with his Brian and his buddies, but after he ruins one social occasion too many, Brian \"breaks up\" with him, and he spirals out of control. Written and directed by Andrew DeYoung, this bromantic black comedy is \"feverishly and hilariously demented\", says Nick Schager in the Daily Beast. \"Partnered with the always ridiculous Rudd, Robinson reconfirms his standing as the reigning master of discomfort. Together, they make Friendship the funniest movie of the year.\"\nReleased on 9 May in the US\nAdmittedly, the last of Disney's live-action remakes, Snow White, was (a) dogged by controversy, and (b) not very good, but Lilo & Stitch looks a lot more promising. The film retells the story a genetically engineered, blue-furred alien called Experiment 626, or Stitch. He is so destructive that he is condemned to be exiled to an asteroid, but he escapes from the interstellar authorities and crash-lands on Earth, where he is befriended by a Hawaiian girl, Lilo. The original 2002 film, then, was one of the few Disney cartoons to have a modern-day US setting, and one of the few to mix contemporary human beings with fantastical creatures \u2013 so, for once, a remake that has both live-action and CGI characters makes total sense. Another good sign is that the film is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, who made the Oscar-nominated charmer Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. And a third key factor is that, in the trailers, Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, seems to have the most adorable chemistry with an alien since Drew Barrymore was in ET The Extra Terrestrial.\nReleased on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally\nNicolas Cage doesn't appear in many subtle dramas these days, so you may not be surprised to hear that The Surfer is \"a gloriously demented B-movie thriller\", as Xan Brooks puts it in The Observer, or that Cage cranks \"the acting dial from befuddled to vexed to outraged to volcanic\". He plays an unnamed businessman who has returned to Australia after years in California, and who wants to buy the beachfront house where he grew up. But when he tries to surf in a nearby bay, he is harassed by a gang of locals led by a shamanic thug (Julian McMahon). Cage's character won't be put off, though, and camps out in the car park above the beach, sacrificing his possessions and his sanity in the process. \"Crisply scripted by Thomas Martin and directed by Lorcan Finnegan with a pleasing, no-frills intensity,\" says Brooks, \"The Surfer [is] a low-budget, hard-hitting comic bruiser of a picture: a midlife-crisis movie dressed up as a 1970s exploitation flick [with a] wild, roiling, hallucinogenic vibe.\"\nReleased on 2 May in the US and Canada, 9 May in the UK and Ireland, and 15 May in Australia\nJane Austen may be turning 250 in December, but film and TV directors are as smitten by her novels as ever. Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden are starring in a new Netflix adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and before that there is a French romantic comedy drama, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, written and directed by Laura Piani. Camille Rutherford stars as Agathe, who works in a bookshop in Paris, but dreams of becoming an author. With the encouragement of her friend Felix (Pablo Pauly), she accepts the offer of a writing residency in England set up by the Austen estate. Will she finish her novel at last? Will she come to see Felix as more than a friend? Or will she fall for one of the residency's organisers (Charlie Anson), a handsome toff who happens to be the great-great-great-great-nephew of Austen\u00a0herself? \"The film is a delightful ode to Jane Austen's novels, serving up a unique blend of humour and introspection that reflects both European sensibilities and the particular quirks of Austen's world,\" says Louisa Moore in Screen Zealots.\nReleased on 16 May in Spain, 23 May in the US, and 30 May in the UK\nThe original Mission: Impossible TV series ran for just seven years, but the film series has been running for 29 \u2013 and its star, Tom Cruise, does plenty of running himself. Could the franchise be coming to a conclusion at last? The subtitle of the eighth instalment, Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning, suggests that Ethan Hunt won't be choosing to accept any more missions after this one, so this could be the last time we'll see Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell crashing cars and jumping off buildings. On the other hand, Cruise is refusing to confirm whether or not Hunt will live to fight another day. \"You gotta see the movie,\" he told Empire magazine. \"It's a hard thing for me to discuss at the moment, because it really is something that you have to experience.\" The film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, is also being cagey, but he does acknowledge that the word \"Final\" is in there for a reason. \"It is, I hope, the satisfying conclusion to a 30-year story arc,\" he says. \"I'm pretty confident that people are going to feel that the title was appropriate.\"\nReleased on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally\nIt seems as if writers and directors can't stop celebrating/ satirising the luxurious lifestyles \u2013 and enviable kitchens \u2013 of the super-rich, whether in such television series as The White Lotus, The Perfect Couple and Your Friends and Neighbors, or in such films as Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness and Blink Twice. The sharpest of all of these depictions is Succession, Jesse Armstrong's multiple Emmy-winning series about a Murdoch-alike media dynasty. And now, two years after Succession concluded its run, Armstrong returns to the territory he has made his own. Mountainhead is a comedy drama shot in Park City, Utah, starring Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith and Ramy Youssef as billionaire tech bros on holiday in a ski resort during a global crisis. The film wasn't even shot until March this year, so Armstrong and his team must be editing it at lightning speed. Could that mean that Mountainhead will be the most topical fictional commentary on the 1% so far?\nReleased on 31 May on HBO and Max, and 1 June on Sky and NOW\n\"After years of misfires, disappointments, and a growing sense of superhero fatigue, the MCU looks poised for a comeback with the highly anticipated arrival of Thunderbolts,\" says Linda Marric in HeyUGuys, \"a gritty but mostly fun new adventure that just might put Marvel back on top.\" The idea behind this rough-edged spy caper is that Marvel's least powerful, least glamorous, and least fulfilled superheroes have been carrying out covert missions for a shady businesswoman (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When she decides that they're expendable, these grumpy loners are forced to form a ragtag team consisting of Florence Pugh's Yelena, David Harbour's Red Guardian, Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, Wyatt Russell's US Agent, and Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost. \"It is a film that makes us truly care about its characters and their well-being,\" says Marric. \"It's gritty, chaotic and sometimes uneven, but also thrilling and unexpectedly heartfelt. Best of all, it proves Marvel can still surprise us when it stops trying to please everyone and leans into the weirdness.\"\u00a0\nOut now in cinemas internationally\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine: at least 45,287 people were killed.\nThis is almost three times more than in the first year of the invasion and significantly exceeds the losses of 2023, when the longest and deadliest battle of the war was taking place in Bakhmut.\nAt the start of the war, losses happened in waves during battles for key locations, but 2024 saw a month-on-month increase in the death toll as the front line slowly edged forward, enabling us to establish that Russia lost at least 27 lives for every kilometre of Ukrainian territory captured.\nThe BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries.\nSo far, we have identified the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThe true number is clearly much higher. Military experts estimate our number may cover between 45% and 65% of deaths, which would mean 164,223 to 237,211 people.\n20 February 2024 was the deadliest day for Russian forces that year.\nAmong the casualties were Aldar Bairov, Igor Babych and Okhunjon Rustamov, who were with the 36th Motorised Rifle Brigade when four Ukrainian long-range HIMARS missiles hit a training ground near the city of Volnovakha in occupied Donetsk.\nThey had been ordered to line up for a medal ceremony. Sixty-five servicemen were killed, including their commander Col Musaev. Dozens more were wounded.\nBairov, 22 and from Buryatia in eastern Siberia, had studied to be a food sanitation specialist but was drafted for mandatory military service and then signed a contract to become a professional soldier.\nIn February 2022 he went to fight in Ukraine and was part of the battle for Borodyanka during his brigade's advance towards Kyiv in March 2022. The town was almost completely destroyed. Ukrainian sources say Russian soldiers were involved in the execution of civilians.\nOkhunjon Rustamov, 31 and from Chita in Siberia, had worked as a welder after serving a mandatory term in special forces. He was mobilised during a partial draft in October 2022.\nUnlike Rustamov, Igor Babych, 32, had volunteered to go to war. He had worked with adults and children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, helping them with physical therapy until April 2023.\nIn total 201 Russian soldiers died on that day, according to our data.\nA few hours after the strike on the training ground, then-Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu met Vladimir Putin to bring him news of military success from the front line.\nThere was no mention of the training ground attack, nor was there any word from the Ministry of Defence in its daily reports.\nA relative of Okhunjon Rustamov said she had already buried three close family members over the course of the war. \"In December 2022, my husband died. On 10 February 2024, my godfather. And on 20 February my half-brother. From one funeral to the next.\"\nIn our analysis, we prioritised exact dates of death for soldiers. If that wasn't available, we used the date of the funeral or the date the death was reported.\nIn the first two years of the war, 2022 and 2023, Russian losses followed a wave-like pattern: heavy fighting with high casualties alternated with periods of relative calm.\nIn 2023, for example, most casualties occurred between January and March, when Russian forces attempted to capture the cities of Vuhledar and Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast.\nIn the first year of the full-scale invasion, according to our calculations, Russia lost at least 17,890 soldiers. This number does not include losses from Russia's two proxy forces in occupied eastern Ukraine.\nIn 2023, the number rose to 37,633.\nIn 2024, there was no period showing a significant fall in casualties. Bloody battles for Avdiivka and Robotyne were followed by intensified assaults towards Pokrovsk and Toretsk.\nIn August 2024, Russian conscripts were killed when Ukrainian forces stormed over the border into the Kursk region. From August 6 to 13 alone, an estimated 1,226 Russian soldiers died.\nHowever, the heaviest overall losses occurred during a slow Russian advance in the east between September and November 2024, according to leading US military analyst Michael Kofman.\n\"Tactics emphasised repeated attacks with dispersed assault groups, using small infantry fire teams, which increased overall casualties relative to terrain gained,\" he explained.\nAfter almost two years of intense fighting, Russian forces seized the logistical hub of Vuhledar in Donetsk on 1 October 2024.\nAccording to estimates by the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), from September to November 2024, Russian forces captured 2,356 square kilometres of Ukraine.\nEven then, Ukrainian forces at the front did not collapse.\nThe cost of this advance was at least 11,678 Russian military deaths.\nActual losses figures are likely higher. We have only accounted for soldiers and officers whose names appeared in publicly available obituaries and whose dates of death or funeral fell within this period.\nOverall in 2024, according to ISW, Russia captured 4,168 square kilometres of land. This means that for each square kilometre captured, 27 Russian soldiers were killed, and this does not include the wounded.\nRussia has found ways of replenishing its depleted forces.\n\"Russian recruitment also increased in the second half of 2024 and exceeded Russian casualties, allowing Moscow to generate additional formations,\" says Michael Kofman.\nOne-time payments to soldiers signing new contracts were increased in three Russian regions. Combat salaries for volunteer soldiers are five to seven times higher than the average wage in most regions.\nWe also class as volunteers those who signed up to avoid criminal prosecution, which was allowed by law in 2024.\nVolunteers have become the fastest-growing category of casualties in our calculations, making up a quarter of those we have identified.\nIn 2023-2024, thousands of volunteers who signed contracts with the Ministry of Defence were sent to the front lines only 10\u201314 days later. Such minimal training will have dramatically reduced their chances of survival, experts say.\nOne Russian republic, Bashkortostan, has seen the highest numbers of casualties, with 4,836 confirmed deaths. Most were from rural areas and 38% had gone to fight with no military experience.\nThe one-time payment for signing a Russian army contract in Ufa is 34 times the region's average salary of 67,575 rubles (\u00a3600).\nCalculating deaths from open source data will always be incomplete.\nThis is because the bodies of a significant number of soldiers killed in the past months may still be on the battlefield and retrieving them presents a risk to serving soldiers.\nThe true death toll for Russian forces increases significantly, if you include those who fought against Ukraine as part of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.\nAn assessment of obituaries and reports of searches for fighters who have lost contact suggests between 21,000 and 23,500 people may have been killed by September 2024.\nThat would bring the total number of fatalities to 185,000 to 260,700 military personnel.",

Other minor parties and independents are ahead in nine seats.\nThat represents an increase of nine for Labor and a significant drop in support for the Greens. However most \"teal\" independents have been returned in their more conservative, inner-city electorates.\nIt's a remarkable turnaround from the start of the year, when polling put Albanese's popularity at record lows after three years of global economic pain, tense national debate, and growing government dissatisfaction.\nIn his Saturday night victory speech, Albanese addressed some of the election's key issues, which also included migration, climate change and energy. \nHe reiterated his promises to make healthcare - most critically GP appointments - more affordable, put buying a house in reach for more Australians, and do more to address climate change and protect the environment.\nNotably, he also vowed to advance reconciliation for First Nations people: \"We will be a stronger nation when we Close the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\"\nIt's a veiled reference to the biggest moment of Albanese's tenure, the failed Voice referendum of October 2023, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution, and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.\nAustralia remains the only Commonwealth country to have never signed a treaty with its Indigenous people.\nThe Voice was one of Albanese's most defining policies, and his most striking setback - it was overwhelmingly rejected after months of often toxic and divisive national debate.\nIndigenous Australians have told the BBC  they feel like they've been forgotten by policymakers since.\nThe prime minister also found difficulty trying to walk a middle path on the Israel-Gaza war, raised eyebrows after buying a multi-million dollar beach pad in the midst of a housing crisis and, like other leaders globally, he grappled with tough economic conditions.\nWith tanking poll numbers, Albanese was broadly seen as the underdog coming into the election, and was poised to be the next victim of the \"incumbency curse\" \u2013 a term to explain a global trend where struggling constituents were turfing out governments after a single term.\nDutton, on the other hand, looked like he was writing a great political comeback - he was on the edge of bringing his party from its worst loss in 70 years back into office in a single term.\nIt has been almost a century since a first-term government has failed to win re-election, but as Australian National University  Emeritus Professor John Warhurst said: \"Dutton entered the campaign [year] in front. It was his to lose.\"\nInstead tonight Dutton has overseen a party loss so emphatic he has lost his own electorate of Dickson, to Labor's Ali France.\n\"I love this country and have fought hard for it,\" he told supporters in Brisbane, conceding defeat.\n\"We have been defined by our opponents in this election which is not a true story of who we are, but we will rebuild from here and we will do that because we know our values, we know our beliefs, and we will always stick to them.\"\nHis campaign was marred by unforced errors: including a series of policy backflips which caused confusion, awkward mistakes on important issues like cost of living and, perhaps most memorably, accidentally booting an AFL ball into a cameraman's head.\n\"The opposition has been shambolic,\" Prof Warhurst says.\nBut the government - while resolute and disciplined in its campaign - was timid. It's strategy was largely allowing voters to judge Dutton and his party, rather than advancing bold or convincing policies, analysts say.\nAnd that's something we heard from voters throughout the campaign too.\nWhile the Coalition turns to licking its wounds and choosing its next leader, it will again have to reckon with its direction.\nLast election, analysts and some of the party's own MPs cautioned against a move towards the right. They questioned whether Dutton \u2013 a polarising figure considered by many to be a conservative hard man \u2013 was the right person to rebuild support, particularly in the moderate areas where they lost a lot of it.\nAfter a campaign which in its dying days ventured into culture war territory and what some say are \"Trumpian\" politics, the Coalition is going to have to ask those questions again \u2013 and if they want to be competitive, perhaps find different answers.\n\"We have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid from the fire hose and we need to have a serious review... we delude ourselves that we are just a few tactical devices away from winning an election,\" former Liberal strategist Tony Barry told the ABC.\nBut meanwhile Labor has to decide what it wants to achieve with the large mandate Australia has handed them.\nAlbanese's \"incumbency curse\" turned out to be a gift, with international uncertainty appearing to have swayed voters in countries like Canada away from change. Likewise, Australia voted for stability.\nLabor struck a \"middle-of-the-road path\" with its a policy platform, but can now afford to be braver, says Amy Remeikis, chief politicial analyst at the Australia Institute think tank.\n\"That was the path that they took to the election, and that is what they are seeing has paid dividends for them. But the question now is: 'Will Labor actually do something with power?'\"",

        "article_text": "Leeds won 29 Championship games this season - more than any other side\nAn incredible Championship title race came to a fitting end on Saturday, running all the way into stoppage time before Leeds United finally pipped Burnley to the post.\nManor Solomon's last-gasp winner at relegated Plymouth Argyle meant Leeds matched the Clarets' win over play-off chasing Millwall, just as the home fans at Turf Moor were gearing up for an almighty party.\nBefore kick-off, Leeds knew it was in their hands, but in typical style, twists and turns followed.\nIt was an epic ending to what has statistically been the most closely-fought hunt for the title. \nFor the first time ever, two teams reached 100 points in the same Championship campaign, with Leeds' superior goal difference proving decisive.\nWith Birmingham City also finishing with 111 points in League One, it is the first time in the Football League's 137-year history that three sides have earned a century of points in the same campaign.\nLeeds seal title with late winner as Argyle go down\nBurnley beat Millwall but miss out on title\nChampionship: Leeds clinch title; Luton down, Coventry and Bristol City into play-offs\nPop star Natasha Bedingfield sang on the pitch after Burnley secured promotion\nBurnley had seen records tumble, including a Championship-best 30 clean sheets - equalling Port Vale's Football League record set in 1953-54 - and have conceded just 16 goals.\nThey have not lost at home all season, have been beaten only twice in the league, and have been unbeaten in 33 Championship games since losing at Millwall in November.\nIt seemed unlikely they would not return to the Premier League as champions, as manager Scott Parker admitted.\n\"If you'd have said to me you'd reach 100 points, 33 games unbeaten, 16 goals conceded and you wouldn't win the league I'd have said 'no chance',\" Parker told BBC Radio Lancashire, after adding a third promotion to his name after success with Fulham in 2020 and Bournemouth in 2022. \n\"We've done remarkably this year. I'm so proud. We came into today hoping it would go our way, but wanting to win the game and get to 100 points, We did that.\"\nMeanwhile, where Burnley have thrived as a defensive unit, Leeds shone in attack. With 95 goals, they were by some distance the top scorers in the division. Joel Piroe (19), Dan James (12) and Solomon (10) have all reached double figures this season.\n\"I can't put into words what I'm feeling right now. It is a dream come true to score the winning goal and take this Championship,\" an emotional Solomon told BBC Radio Leeds at full-time. \n\"Throughout the season we've shown we deserve this trophy and to finish in the first spot. I'm so glad it happened.\n\"We all knew what was happening at Burnley and we knew we needed to score. It paid off and the ball went into the net. It will take me a few days to digest what happened today, right now I'm going to celebrate.\"\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke (right) has won promotion from the Championship for the third time\nLike Parker, Leeds boss Daniel Farke has vast experience of getting out of the Championship. \nHe did so as champions with Norwich City in 2019 and 2021 and has now led the West Yorkshire club back to the Premier League after bouncing back from play-off final heartache against Southampton a year ago.\nFarke told BBC Sport: \"Of course I'm happy that we won this game in the final stages and are officially allowed to label ourselves as champions and the best team this season.\n\"It's an emotionally moving day because we have invested so much and wanted to crown ourselves with some silverware.\n\"It feels pretty, pretty special in the dressing room and I'm very happy for my players and staff, it means so much for them, and also our supporters.\"\nNobody should forget Sheffield United, either. Although four defeats in five games in April, including a loss at Burnley which ultimately knocked them out of contention for automatic promotion, proved fatal, the Blades led for long periods and looked the most likely.\nChris Wilder's side will need to go again in the play-offs, starting against Bristol City in the semi-finals. They have shown their readiness for the Premier League this season, finishing on 90 points, a tally which would have been enough to go up automatically in three of the previous six seasons.\nWhile that points to a more competitive top of the Championship than ever, successive seasons with all three promoted clubs coming down, including Burnley and the Blades, offers a stark warning too.\nA strong defensive unit will be crucial to hopes of survival, and Clarets captain Josh Brownhill, who also scored 18 goals, believes his team have a strong chance of improvement this time around.\n\"This is a different team, we look in really good shape to go up for next season and hopefully stay up. It is going to be difficult but we've worked hard on everything; our defensive record speaks for itself,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Credit to the staff and the fans but mainly the gaffer. He has worked harder than anybody. 100 points, unbeaten at home, unbeaten in 33 games, our defensive record has been exceptional.\"\nNever before have two teams accrued so many points in the same season at the top of the second tier. \nTheir consistency and strength of character laid the groundwork. Leeds held their nerve in the end, and right at the end, but ultimately, both they and Burnley can revel in achievements fit for the history books.",

        "article_text": "A new type of tobacco product is finding growing numbers of users around the world, but there are still serious questions about how it affects human health.\nHaving smoked for nearly 30 years since the age of 13, IT consultant and freelance writer Ben Taylor was intrigued by the sound of heated tobacco products.\nAttempting to switch from cigarettes to vapes hadn't worked for Taylor. \"Vaping liquids always left me wanting,\" he posted on his blog. So he decided to try IQOS, a sleek, pen-shaped electronic device that heats sticks of rolled tobacco, developed by the American multinational tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI).\nRather than burning tobacco, these devices heat it to a temperature high enough to create a vapour but not smoke.\nFor Taylor, it didn't quite replicate the experience of smoking a cigarette, but it came much closer than vaping \u2013 the other popular cigarette alternative, which uses handheld pens to heat a flavoured nicotine-containing liquid. \"You can tell you're consuming real tobacco,\" Taylor wrote. Over time, he says, he came to prefer IQOS due to the taste, and the lack of a lingering cigarette stench. He also says his previously near-permanent cough disappeared.\nTobacco manufacturers that sell heated tobacco devices market them as being a less harmful alternative to cigarettes. They point to industry-funded research that shows they produce lower levels of compounds known to be harmful to human health.\nBut there is growing concern in the medical community that these devices still pose a health risk to both the people who use them and those standing nearby. They also warn that as relatively new products, the long-term effects of using heated tobacco have still to be properly investigated.\nYet they are also becoming increasingly common, with next-generation heated tobacco products now available in more than 60 countries. They have experienced particularly notable growth in both\u00a0Italy and Japan,\u00a0where they have been present since 2014. And this growth is expected to continue as they start to penetrate the market in the US.\nSo, is heated tobacco really helping people enjoy nicotine in a less harmful way, or could it be a new public health crisis in the making?\nIQOS and other devices like it are the latest iteration of a concept which the tobacco industry has been intermittently toying with for the past four decades. In 1988, an American tobacco company called RJ Reynolds\u00a0attempted to commercialise the very first heated tobacco product, a device called Premier. Designed to look similar to a conventional cigarette in shape and size, the Premier had a specifically designed carbon tip that users would light to heat the tobacco. But despite a reported $300m (roughly \u00a3180m at the time) in investment, Premier\u00a0was removed from the market\u00a0after just six months as users complained about its taste and smell.\nAfter various reinventions, heated tobacco products have started to enjoy commercial success in the past decade with a new range of electronic devices that use several methods to vaporise their contents. Typically these involve encasing tobacco in either sticks, plugs, capsules or pods, which are then heated with an electronic element. As well as PMI's IQOS, leading brands include Ploom, made by Japan Tobacco International (JTI), and glo, made by British American Tobacco (BAT).\nEmploying sleek, appealing designs and backed by\u00a0multi-million dollar marketing strategies \u2013 which have included everything from social media influencers\u00a0to pop-up stores \u2013 these devices have been far more successful than the original incarnations. Celebrities\u00a0have backed heated tobacco products, with the\u00a0musician Jamiroquai and actors Alberto Amman and Monica Cruz attending the IQOS 3 launch party in Madrid in 2019. Jamiroquai also performed at\u00a0a 2018 launch event\u00a0for IQOS 3 in Milan, while American dance music DJ Steve Aoki, whose name is attached to a limited edition version of an IQOS device,\u00a0performed a concert at another event for the products in Barcelona in January 2025.\nBAT have also\u00a0employed similar marketing tactics, paying social media influencers, sponsoring boat parties and organising giveaways at Formula 1 races.\nSo far, heated tobacco products have had limited penetration in the US. While one survey of 40,000 US adults found that 8% were aware of them, only 0.5% had ever used one of the devices. But that could change. After first receiving a\u00a0limited authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019, IQOS is\u00a0now re-entering\u00a0the US market in Austin, Texas.\nThe tobacco industry\u00a0promotes this new generation of heated tobacco products as a safer, smoke-free alternative, stressing that they only heat, not burn tobacco. PMI's website, for example,\u00a0states\u00a0that they aim to remove \"combustion of tobacco, the cause of most tobacco-related diseases\", celebrating IQOS as \"the next step in tobacco harm reduction\". The company\u00a0estimates that more than 22 million adults\u00a0globally have quit smoking cigarettes and switched to its heated tobacco products.\nPMI has said in the past that it intends to stop selling cigarettes and become a smoke-free company. It is investing heavily in products such as heated tobacco and hopes for at least two-thirds of its revenues to come from smoke-free products by 2030.\u00a0\nBut independent researchers and public health experts argue that heated tobacco products are still harmful to human health and urge users to give up tobacco altogether. They express concerns at some of the marketing strategies, saying that the use of influencers and glamorous launch parties could encourage heated tobacco use among young people, who are more likely not to have smoked before, which could make these products a gateway to cigarettes.\u00a0\nPMI, JTI and BAT all insist their products are aimed at adults only. PMI says it has a robust code of conduct that does not allow marketing that appeals to minors such as cartoons, youth-orientated celebrities or models who are or appear to be under the age of 25. BAT said they carry out due diligence on any influencer partnerships to ensure that a significant majority of their followers are over 18 years old. JTI says it is \"committed to the principle that minors should never use or access nicotine-containing products\". It says it ensures it markets its heated tobacco products in a \"socially responsible way\" in accordance with applicable laws and rules.\nBut Silvano Gallus, an epidemiologist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, believes that existing smokers do not appear to be the main audience for these products, despite the messaging from tobacco firms. He first started monitoring the rollout of heated tobacco products more than a decade ago.\n\"We began to see the promotion of these products everywhere with advertisements, events and parties, particularly aimed at young people,\" says Gallus, reflecting on the initial launch of heated tobacco in the cities of Milan and Nagoya, Japan.\u00a0\nIn 2019, PMI suspended a social media campaign involving digital influencers after the news organisation Reuters revealed the company had been using young online personalities to market its products, including a 21-year-old woman, in breach of its own code of conduct. PMI said at the time that no laws were broken, but acknowledged that the campaign failed to meet the company's standards.\nGallus claims that the users of heated tobacco products in Italy tend to be young, pointing to surveys which have described their use as widespread among adolescents. \"They aren't 60-year-old hardcore smokers looking for an alternative to cigarettes,\" he says.\u00a0\nPMI, however, insists that unintended use among youths is low in the 70 markets where IQOS is currently available. It points to a survey in 2021 funded by the Japanese government that showed 0.9% of those questioned in junior high school (aged 13-15) and 1.4% of those in high school (aged 16-18) said they used heated tobacco. It is illegal to smoke or buy tobacco in Japan under the age of 20. Other studies in countries around the world show use among youths is in the low single digits, PMI says.\nBut there is concern among public health experts that if young people who have never smoked cigarettes really are drawn to heated tobacco products, it could introduce new groups of people to potentially harmful habits.\nIn 2024, Gallus and a group of fellow tobacco control researchers in Italy published a study based on data from more than 3,000 Italians aged between 18 and 74, who they tracked for six months during 2020. They found that non-smokers who began using heated tobacco products were 5.8 times as likely to subsequently transition to smoking within the six month study period as people who had never used heated tobacco products.\n\"We know that this product is a gateway to conventional cigarettes,\" says Gallus. It is a concern shared by other researchers.\nBut PMI describes Gallus' study as unreliable and says that heated tobacco can provide a route out of smoking. Gallus and his colleagues acknowledge themselves that their study had a limited sample size and needs to be verified with larger studies. The results may also have been impacted by the pandemic and widespread lockdowns which were taking place at the time.\nResearchers like Gallus, however, view heated tobacco products as a setback in the battle to drive down tobacco use and have accused the industry of cynically targeting young people. They point to the fact that, to date, marketing for IQOS has appeared at music festivals and film festivals in Europe, Asia and South America, alongside high profile partnerships with streetwear brands and fashion designers.\nIt is a concern echoed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In a\u00a02023 summary of evidence, experts at the WHO\u00a0warned that the lower cost of heated tobacco sticks compared to a pack of cigarettes \"undermines the progress made in reducing use that was accomplished by making products more expensive\". The report, which was by Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organisation that invests heavily in reducing tobacco use, added that the marketing of heated tobacco products often combined claims of reduced harm relative to cigarettes with \"the passion for technology of primarily young people\".\nAccording to a report produced by the non-profit organisation Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids \u2013 which also receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies \u2013 influencer-driven campaigns on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube have also played a key role in raising the visibility of IQOS and other heated tobacco brands. A study by researchers at the University of Rochester in the US also found that Instagram posts featuring heated tobacco products often position the devices as lifestyle products by showing them alongside models, swimming pools or a luxury car. Posts with models or lifestyle elements received higher engagement.\u00a0\nPMI categorically denies marketing its heated tobacco products to young people and says it does not have an official account on TikTok, while its account on X is used for customer care only. The company also says at least 75% of the audience must be over the legal age for purchasing tobacco products at any third-party events it sponsors. PMI claims 82% of IQOS users are over the age of 29, according to its own estimates.\nBut the debate over the marketing of heated tobacco also obscures another issue \u2013 these products are so new that there is still little research to assess their long-term health effects.\nMost research on the vapour emissions from heated tobacco products have been funded by tobacco companies or carried out by scientists directly employed by them. They show that heated tobacco aerosols contain significantly fewer harmful compounds than cigarette smoke.\nSome studies by independent researchers have also found that switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco can be beneficial in some people \u2013 such as patients with chronic lung disease. But other scientific research also suggests that heated tobacco products are unlikely to be benign for our health.\u00a0\nIn 2017, a group of Swiss scientists published a study disputing one of PMI's central marketing claims, namely that IQOS is smoke-free because of the lack of combustion or burning of the tobacco leaves.\u00a0\nInstead, the researchers argue that the emissions from heated tobacco devices should still be considered as \"smoke\" and should fall under indoor smoking bans in the same way as cigarettes. Their study showed that IQOS tobacco reaches around 330C (626F), a finding supported by other studies, while a conventional cigarette reached around 684C (1,263F).\nIn their subsequent analysis of IQOS emissions, they concluded that the heated tobacco vapour also contained harmful chemicals which stem from pyrolysis \u2013 the term for incomplete combustion \u2013 and thermogenic degradation, making it more similar to cigarette smoke than the company was claiming. \"Smokers and non-smokers need accurate information about toxic compounds released in IQOS smoke,\" the scientists wrote.\u00a0\nPMI was quick to respond to the study, sending the authors a letter disputing many of the results. A subsequent analysis by the FDA also warned there were \"significant analytical issues\" with the study that made it difficult to compare the levels of harmful and potentially harmful compounds from heated tobacco to those from cigarettes. PMI maintains that IQOS heats tobacco but does not burn it.\nOther research, however, has examined the type and quantity of toxins present in the vapours produced by heated tobacco.\nAt the National Technical University of Athens, chemical engineer Efthimios Zervas has spent much of the past decade painstakingly analysing the chemicals present in the fumes of products including IQOS and glo. He describes it as a slow and complex process because the fumes emitted contain many thousands of different chemicals, in combinations that vary greatly from one product to another.\u00a0\n\"We try to study as much as we can, but it's difficult because as soon as we publish our results, this product we've been analysing has either been modified or is no longer on the market,\" he says. \"So you're constantly playing catch-up with the industry.\"\nStill, Zervas has drawn a number of conclusions. As with cigarettes, he has found that heated tobacco products release high concentrations of fine particles, capable of penetrating deep into the body. Other studies have identified known toxins present in the gaseous emissions. Indeed, many toxins and carcinogens were present at far lower concentrations in heated tobacco vapours than in fumes from cigarettes. But Zervas has found others, such as carbonyl methylglyoxal, that he says are actually emitted in higher concentrations by heated tobacco products.\u00a0\n\"There are toxic products in there, so we cannot say that these devices are safe,\" says Zervas.\nPMI says that its own research indicates that IQOS does not generate solid particles in the aerosol it emits.\nIndustry-backed studies have also reported a long list of compounds in the aerosols from heated tobacco \u2013 one study by BAT found more than 120 while another detected 205 compounds in the aerosols, including 82 not seen in cigarette smoke. These include compounds that are the result of heating glycerol, which is one of the ingredients in heated tobacco sticks. The WHO has called for more research to evaluate the effect of these compounds on human health when inhaled at the relatively high levels in heated tobacco aerosols.\nMeanwhile early studies in animals indicate that there may be some long-term effects of heated tobacco on cardiovascular health and the central nervous system, but these results are yet to be seen in humans.\nSuch sentiments have been noted by regulators. While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised PMI to market multiple heated tobacco products, it also declared that this \"does not mean these products are safe nor FDA approved\". The FDA also says, \"There are no safe tobacco products, so those who do not currently use tobacco products, especially young people, should not start.\"\nAll three of the tobacco companies the BBC spoke to acknowledge that it would be incorrect to say heated tobacco products are safe or risk free. But they say research indicates that they provide a way of reducing exposure to harmful compounds if smokers switch from cigarettes to heated tobacco products.\n\"This fundamental principle underpins the promise that smoke-free products like IQOS hold for advancing global health and further validates PMI's commitment to a smoke-free future,\" says Moira Gilchrist, PMI's global chief communications officer.\n\"The majority of risk associated with cigarettes comes from the burning of tobacco and not the nicotine,\" says a BAT spokesperson. \"glo, while not risk free, does not involve burning tobacco.\" Footnotes in their response, however, added that their statement assumes a complete switch from cigarette smoking and notes that their product is addictive and not risk free.\n\"JTI does not market any of its products including heated tobacco products as smoking cessation products,\" says a JTI spokesperson. \"They are an alternative for smokers looking for products with the potential to reduce the risks associated with smoking.\"\u00a0\nThere are some who question the science that major companies are using to promote heated tobacco products. The European Respiratory Society Tobacco Control Committee published a position paper in February 2024 on the subject. The paper states that, while the tobacco industry claims a 90-95% reduction in harmful and potentially harmful substances and toxicity for heated tobacco products, this is not the full picture. Independent research shows these products emit substantial levels of carcinogenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, irritants and potential carcinogens, as well as similar nicotine and tar levels to a standard cigarette, the paper states.\nSome researchers have also cast doubt on the clinical trials conducted by tobacco companies themselves. In 2022, a systematic review by the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group \u2013 which receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies and are part of STOP, a global tobacco industry watchdog \u2013 concluded that PMI's clinical trials of its heated tobacco products were of poor quality and at high risk of bias.\u00a0\nPMI did not provide a response to these allegations when asked by the BBC, but it characterised the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group as an \"unreliable and inaccurate source of information\". It did not provide any further evidence to support this accusation.\nWith other forms of smokeless tobacco also on the rise, which can be chewed, sucked or snuffed, many anti-tobacco lobbyists are frustrated by the lack of progress. Staying ahead of the proliferation of new forms of tobacco consumption is like playing a game of \"whack-a-mole\", says Sandra Mullin, senior vice-president of policy, advocacy and communication at Vital Strategies, an international non-profit organisation that has partnered with governments around the world to develop tobacco control policies.\n\"I was in China in January, and they showed us these new models of heated tobacco products that don't look like tobacco, they look like a toy,\" she says, adding that she would like to have more data that demonstrates whether there are serious health impacts from such products.\nOne aspect that is particularly worrying public health officials, including the WHO, is that these devices may actually encourage people to consume more tobacco. A 2022 systematic review by researchers in the UK concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show they help people to stop smoking. The 2023 WHO report on heated tobacco also warns that the available data indicates that most smokers become dual users and \"do not substantially reduce their risk from tobacco products\".\nGallus and his colleagues recently published a review of 26 studies on the use of heated tobacco products conducted around the world since 2022. Two out of three heated tobacco users are dual users, he and his colleagues concluded.\nAccording to Gallus, dual users have a significantly higher risk of disease and premature death compared with smokers.\n\"If you're not actually reducing tobacco consumption, it undoes any potential reduced harm effects, and the industry's just making money from people twice over,\" says Sophie Braznell, a researcher in the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group and a spokesperson for STOP.\nPMI claims its own data demonstrates the majority of IQOS users have given up smoking. It estimates 72% of IQOS users are people who have fully switched from cigarettes. JTI and BAT did not respond to questions about dual use of their products.\nBut with IQOS returning to the US, starting with the devices going on sale in Austin, Texas in March 2025, Yolonda Richardson, president and chief executive of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, is concerned that more people will become users of multiple tobacco or nicotine products. E-cigarettes\u00a0remain popular among younger people while nicotine pouches that are placed between the lip and gum are now showing signs of growing in popularity, with the CDC reporting a substantial increase in nationwide sales in the US since 2016.\nHowever, Richardson says that it may take a long time before the full health consequences become apparent. When they do, it will be exceedingly difficult to pinpoint the underlying source, as individuals will have been exposed to different concentrations of nicotine in different forms, as well as varying sources of tobacco.\nZervas argues that the onus should be on the tobacco industry to prove that its products are not dangerous before they're able to enter the market, rather than the other way round.\n\"It's like with food or drugs,\" he says. \"We study them first and, if they're safe, we allow them. With the tobacco industry's products, we allow them into the market and then have to prove they're dangerous, or very dangerous.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

It was incredibly winding.\"\nHe was diagnosed so early in the UK Aids epidemic that he was named Patient L1 at the hospital, and his story was featured in the 2014 film Pride.\nRecalling the early days of diagnosis, he told BBC London \"every single lymph node in my body had just erupted\". \nAfter undergoing tests in hospital, he was kept in a side ward for two days.\nJonathan, who is now 76, said he was told by doctors he would be given \"palliative care when the time comes\" - to which he thought: \"I'm 33, do I really want to hear about palliative care?\"\nHe added: \"I have been living with this virus and literally just trying to live every day. Never thinking that I will have a life, it's always been there.\"\nHIV is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease.\nAids (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is when a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses happen when the immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus.\nWhile Aids cannot be transmitted from one person to another, the HIV virus can.\n\"It really wasn't until 2015, when they first announced 'U = U', 'Undetectable = Untransmittable', that I was no longer this kind of leper - that I had this poisoned blood, that I could infect anybody,\" Jonathan said.\nThe term means that if someone has an undetectable viral load, they cannot sexually transmit HIV to others.\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust charity reports that by 1999, 33m people were living with HIV worldwide while the World Health Report listed Aids as the fourth biggest killer worldwide, 20 years after the epidemic began.\nAccording to the National Aids Trust, 2023 was the highest year for people receiving HIV care with 107,949 treated - an increase of 27% across the last 10 years.\nJonathan said: \"HIV is this forgotten epidemic. It is never talked about and it's so important it is. \n\"A lot of that is to do with stigma.\"\nHe added: \"I was on effective medication, because we have an amazing NHS. I am so fortunate that I have had access to the medication.\n\"The most important thing to do is know your status, be brave, get tested.\n\"The developments that are happening are extraordinary - even though there is no cure,\" he continued.\n\"I'm living proof.\"\nJonathan attended the launch on Wednesday of the report Getting to zero by 2030: HIV in London at the site of the future\u00a0HIV/Aids Memorial which is planned to be placed in Fitzrovia.\nIn 2018, the London mayor, London Councils, Public Health England and NHS England signed up to the Fast-Track Cities Declaration to reach zero new HIV infections, zero HIV-related stigma and zero HIV-related deaths by 2030.\nThe report, by the London Assembly Health Committee, found that despite progress in attitudes towards HIV, HIV-related stigma remained prevalent in London and the UK.\nLondon has historically had, and continues to have, higher rates of HIV than the rest of the country. \nHowever, the London Assembly said the city was leading the way globally to end new HIV cases and was seen as a leading international example through its HIV prevention and treatment programmes.\nThe Assembly added that \"concerted action\" would be required to increase testing, improve access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), ensure that everyone with HIV could access the care they needed and that services must reach people and communities who were currently missing out on them. \nRecommendations in the report included:\nChair of the\u00a0London Assembly Health Committee, Krupesh Hirani,\u00a0said London was \"a long way off\" reaching its 2030 target.\n\"After many years in which there was a year-on-year decline in new HIV cases, there has been an increase in cases in London and England since 2020. We would like to see the mayor take further action,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the mayor said Sadiq Khan would respond to the Assembly's report in due course.\nThey added: \"The current government has committed to commissioning a new HIV action plan and the mayor looks forward to working closely with ministers to help end HIV cases by 2030, as we build a fairer and healthier London for everyone.\" \nIn December 2023, the mayor announced \u00a3130,000 of funding from the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm towards the construction of a permanent HIV and Aids memorial in London. \nAids Memory UK, which is behind the project, said the memorial would be unveiled at the end of 2027 and the artwork would take the form of a felled tree.\nAmbassador of Aids Memorial UK, Mzz Kimberley, also known as Kim Tatum, said: \"The memorial is going to be a place where people can go and reflect, educate themselves, feel peace, talk to people.\n\"This memorial will mean that everyone who lost their life had meaning. \n\"It's a dedication to all the people around the world who've lost their life, or the injustices that society has brought to them.\"\nThe memorial means a lot to Jonathan, saying it would help \"create a community - I am so proud to be part of this HIV community.\n\"I've lost lots of friends - some very, very early but some more recently, and it still hurts.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "One of Marks & Spencer's biggest suppliers has resorted to using pen and paper for orders as the disruption from the cyber attack on the retailer continues.\nThe boss of Greencore, which supplies sandwiches, rolls and wraps, says it has also ramped up deliveries by a fifth to make sure there is more than enough food for the bank holiday weekend. \nM&S has been unable to offer online orders for clothing and homewares for over a week, and some stores have seen empty shelves as food deliveries have also been disrupted.\nTwo M&S workers told the BBC they were concerned about pay because they were unable to clock in and out of work and could not access staff apps.\nIn a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes situation at M&S, Greencore chief executive Dalton Philips said: \"In the absence of having all the systems speaking to each other, you revert to how it was 25 years ago.\"\nThat means back to \"pen and paper\", he said.\nGreencore has also been putting on additional shifts at its dedicated M&S factory in Northampton, putting more lorries on the road, and is sending more food to stores than they did over Christmas.\n\"They're a massive customer for us and we're trying to flood them with products to help them,\" said Mr Philips.\n\"There are times when you do need to revert to manual systems in any business... but look, it works well.\n\"With the challenges of the system we don't have intricate forecasting that we would have previously had, so we're just making sure that they've got everything they need and some more.\"\nGeorge, not his real name, works at an M&S in Wales, and said it has been \"a nightmare\".\n\"We have been told pay will be given through a separate payment system. However, we have not been told whether the pay will be correct.\n\"Additionally, there have been back-and-forth instructions, which have changed hourly. For example: remove gift cards from shop floor, put them back (when working).\"\nOne former M&S customer assistant from Scunthorpe, who retired from their store at the end of April, said they had been unable to clock in and out of work as a result of the attack.\n\"There is no way of receiving advice via managers or the outsourced HR,\" they told the BBC.\nM&S has reassured staff that they will be paid for all contracted hours as usual.\nAs a former chief executive of the supermarket chain Morrisons, Mr Philips knows only too well the pressure M&S bosses are under.\n\"They will be literally working 24/7. You've got to work your way through it. Whenever I've spoken to the team this week, it's been really impressive how calm and focused they are.\n\"I think if you work in retail, you know people are often the most on their game and motivated at those periods of intense pressure.\"\nGreencore has also sent a handful of its own staff to key M&S stores in London to provide extra support.\nM&S hasn't released details on how its systems have been affected, saying only that some have been temporarily taken offline leading to pockets of limited availability in stores.\nOne food industry veteran who knows the business well thinks M&S will be focusing on making sure it can still provide all of its best-selling items.\n\"The issue is, if you've got 7,000 products, then obviously that's a lot of data to review.\"\nBut he also pointed out that for big seasonal events there will be a lot of buying in advance and the company will have historical back-ups. Suppliers will also have a view on what will sell well.\nGed Futter, a former buyer for Asda who now runs his own consultancy advising suppliers, says M&S is in a difficult situation, but believes it will find a way round it as retailers are very good at finding solutions.\n\"If they have to, they'll use a fax machine. Any silo mentality disappears and everyone becomes very clearly focused on how to fix it.\"\nBut the longer this goes on, the risk of damage to M&S's reputation and to its customer loyalty increases.\nThe company has been praised for its communications with customers, but has kept quiet on the nature of the attack and how it unfolded. That may not be sustainable for much longer.\nThe chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, Liam Byrne, has written to M&S chief executive Stuart Machin seeking reassurances, saying it was \"imperative\" to understand what had happened.\nOne person, who is a former chief executive at another firm and had to deal with a data breach, told the BBC the advice from his PR adviser was simple.\n\"Say nothing until you know everything. Then say everything. Then say nothing.\"\nM&S has been contacted for comment. \nAdditional reporting by Kris Bramwell ",
