But as things stand, 11 teams feature a gambling sponsor on the front of their shirts, an increase of three from last season.\nAccording to figures from GlobalData, the combined value of shirt sponsorship deals involving Premier League clubs and gambling companies in the 2024-25 season is $135.43m (\u00a3101.1m).\nThe other nine clubs are sponsored by companies from four industries - air travel, entertainment, financial services and technology.\nRewind three decades to the foundation of the Premier League and none of its 22 clubs had a shirt sponsorship deal with a gambling company.\nJust over half of the companies which sponsored teams in the 1992-93 campaign were headquartered in the UK, and the majority sold physical products in Britain.\nNowadays, none of the front-of-shirt sponsor companies are aiming to sell physical products that fans can buy directly, and only one is headquartered in the UK. Even that one, Liverpool partner bank Standard Chartered, does not allow UK customers to open a current account with it.\nIndustries such as technology, construction and clothing have almost completely disappeared from shirts.\nFive of the 1992-93 shirt sponsors - Commodore, Fisons, ICI, Mita Copiers and Tulip Computers - have since gone out of business.\nIn the inaugural Premier League season, seven Premier League shirt sponsors companies were based within 100 miles of their club. Of those, four were based within 10 miles, and two - Sheffield United and Ipswich - were located less than a mile away.\nNow, only one club - Liverpool - are based within 1,000 miles of their shirt sponsor's main base.\nThe average distance between a club and their shirt sponsor's main office in 1992-93 was 1,859 miles. Now it is 4,431 miles.\nGlobalisation and advances in technology have also played a role in shifting the dynamic of modern sponsorships - big business and wider influence is increasingly what sponsor companies are aiming for, rather than the cash from the pockets of the fans in the stands.\n\"In the UK there around 70 million people, but worldwide you're talking about a marketplace of billions,\" says Dr Joe Piggin, senior lecturer in sports management and policy at the University of Loughborough. \"So the economic incentives are there for the companies.\"\nAs the global financial picture has changed, companies in countries which enjoyed booming economies in the early 90s that have now weakened - such as Japan - have become less common shirt sponsors.\nMeanwhile, newer money in modern financial strongholds such as the Middle East is being spent on sponsorship deals.\nSponsor companies gain far more from partnerships with clubs than just advertising \u2013 access to private boxes can be used to host clients, photoshoots with superstar players can be used in corporate material, and relationships can in some cases be used for political leverage.\n\"The Premier League should look after itself,\" Piggin says. \"Not just in terms of the economic sustainability, but in terms of connecting with their local communities.\"\nThe Premier League itself does not have an official gambling partner, but Uefa announced its first formal gambling sponsor last summer.\nAccording to data from Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report, gambling firms are also the most common sponsors of top division clubs in Belgium, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Russia.\nThe top industries for shirt sponsorships across top divisions in Europe are:\nGambling (15%)\nRetail (12%)\nAir travel; automotive; financial services; food and drink (all 10%)\nIn the Championship, gambling is also the most popular category of shirt sponsor with six clubs - Burnley, Middlesbrough, QPR, Stoke, Sunderland, and Watford.\nThere are no gambling sponsors on shirts in League One and League Two. The most common industries in those divisions are energy, automotive, and food and drink.\nThree Scottish Premiership clubs - Celtic, Dundee United and Rangers - are sponsored by gambling firms.\nResearch shows that gambling advertisements were shown more than 29,000 times in the UK during the first weekend of this Premier League season, almost trebling the previous campaign's figure.\n\"Gambling advertising has become almost inextricably linked to football and the industry makes a concerted effort to target young men, which is the profile most likely to develop problems with gambling,\" says Matt Zarb-Cousin, co-founder of Gamban, software which aims to help users quit online gambling.\n\"There's a generation that's growing up in an environment that associates watching football with betting - they've been conditioned to believe it's a normal thing to do as part of enjoying sport.\"\nAccording to the UK Gambling Commission's latest figures, gambling firms earned revenue of \u00a315.1bn between April 2022 and March 2023. That income has given them plenty to spend on advertising. And even with the front-of-shirt ban looming, some believe they will move their advertising into other areas like pitchside hoardings and maybe even shirt sleeves.\n\"The front-of-shirt sponsorship withdrawal appears symbolic,\" Piggin says. \"I'm quite sceptical about the significance of that move beyond public relations.\nUnder-18s are not allowed to wear shirts with gambling sponsors - meaning young players have featured in games with sponsor-free jerseys.\nLeicester City's 15-year-old winger Jeremy Monga played wearing a shirt without the club's gambling sponsor on the front when he made his debut against Newcastle United earlier in April\nNone of the Premier League's six wealthiest clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur - feature a gambling firm on the front of their shirts.\nTargeting clubs lower down the league, who face a much higher threat of relegation and the potential economic insecurity that comes with that, is a way for gambling firms to associate themselves with the Premier League without having to fork out top-end sums.\n\"It is cheaper than sponsoring any of the top six,\" Piggin says. \"And they also get their brand on shirts in photos of these teams playing the top six anyway. So there would be that legitimacy of 'look, we're in the Premier League, who cares who we're sponsoring?'\"\nSome of the gambling sponsors are based in tax havens such as Curacao and Malta, allowing them to keep more of the profits they make from customers.\nUK customers are not even able to bet with some of the gambling companies which feature on the front of shirts. \nThese so-called 'white label' firms instead use sponsorship of Premier League clubs to target customers in other markets.\nThe gambling companies which sponsor Nottingham Forest and Wolves are among those targeting customers in Asia\nA lot of those companies are based in East Asia, and are aimed at customers in China, even though gambling is illegal there.\n\"There are ways around China's gambling ban using VPNs and so on,\" says Dr Raffaello Rossi, lecturer in marketing at the University of Bristol. \"They're advertising in the UK, not China, so the Chinese government can't do anything about it. But still they're reaching the Chinese population because the Premier League is a global phenomenon.\"\nThe fact that UK customers can't gamble with some of these companies doesn't necessarily mean the advertisement has zero impact on British spectators, however.\n\"It can still trigger someone to start betting because you recognise it's a betting sponsor,\" Rossi adds.",

        "article_text": "From the latest season of the dystopian workplace drama to the UK miniseries that got the world talking and a new hit medical show, we pick the year's greatest programmes to stream right now.\nHollywood is an easy target, but this satire is so sharp, astute and sometimes absurd that it may be the funniest show of the year. Seth Rogen, who co-created the show, plays Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of Continental Studios, a lover of high-art films with a mandate to make commercial hits based on IP including Kool-Aid. A flood of actors and directors \u2013 including Ron Howard, Olivia Wilde and Zoe Kravitz \u2013 make cameo appearances, gleefully spoofing their own images, none funnier than Martin Scorsese in the hilarious opening episode. The series regulars are ideally cast, with Ike Barniholtz as Sal Saperstein, Matt's second-in-command, Catherine O'Hara as the previous studio head and Kathryn Hahn as the loud, wackily-dressed head of publicity. Taking us into the Golden Globes and marketing meetings, The Studio suggests that everyone is just bumbling along at a moment when the entire movie industry is in crisis. The industry might not know where it's going, but this behind-the-scenes comedy is a pure delight. (CJ)\nAvailable on Apple TV+ internationally\nOne thing's for sure: if Mike White's first-world-problems satire about rich holidaymakers was admired by many for its first two seasons, it broke out to become a true cultural phenomenon in its third, with a huge ratings boost. This time round, it sent its dysfunctional groupings \u2013 a corrupt financier and his family, three clashing female friends, a vengeful man and his younger girlfriend \u2013 to a Thai wellness retreat, and every week, you could not move online (metaphorically) for the discourse it generated and debate it stirred. Some complained that this season was too slow and lacked\u00a0suitable plot momentum, while others pointed out, sagely, that the problem was that it was a character-led drama that was never meant to be dissected like Game\u00a0of Thrones, but for its unexpected blockbuster popularity. Personally? I enjoyed it as both the darkest and most reflective series so far, but one which again thrived off a magisterially cast ensemble, in which Parker Posey, Carrie Coon, Aimee Lou Wood and Patrick Schwarzenegger were standouts, but no one was a weak link. (HM)\nAvailable on Max in the US and Now in the UK\u00a0\nIt's no wonder that this uncompromising British series about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl in his school has become a cultural flashpoint, praised by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, made available to be shown in schools and sparking conversations about young men and the toxic influence of social media. The social issue is wrapped in a drama brilliantly personalized and brought to life by the actors. Stephen Graham, who created the show with Jack Thorne, plays the boy's father and conveys the shock and grief of a parent forced to consider the unthinkable possibility that his son might be a killer. Owen Cooper gives a remarkably sophisticated performance as the accused boy, who seems guileless until he explodes in anger. And Ashley Waters plays a detective who struggles to understand his own teenage son, expanding the theme beyond one family. Each episode was shot in a single, real-time take, which sounds like a gimmick, but director Philip Barantini handles that approach so smoothly that it fades into the background, even while adding intensity to a piercing drama that offers no comfortable resolution. (CJ)\nAvailable on Netflix internationally\nFairly or not, Apple TV+ has become a streamer known for ploughing huge resources (\nover $20bn, reportedly\n) into a range of starry shows that not very many people watch \u2013 but with the second series of this dystopian workplace drama, it became clear it had a genuine watercooler hit on its hands. Which is even more surprising, when you consider just how strange Severance is. Its compelling high-concept premise \u2013 in which employees of the sinister Lumon corporation have their consciousness separated into office selves, or \"innies\", and home selves, or \"outies\" \u2013 is one thing, but beyond that, it is constantly taking the story down surreal rabbit holes, involving for example, mysterious \"macrodata refinement\" work or a herd of goats. In truth, as this series progressed through its second half, it felt a little too meandering for its own good, and its climactic payoff couldn't match that from the first season. But it's still an exquisite work in all areas, from the clever dual-identity acting (especially from shining star Britt Lower) to the stark visuals. Bring on season three, and perhaps a few more solid answers as to what's\n really\n going on at Lumon. (HM)\nAvailable on Apple TV+ internationally\u00a0\nIt might sound like just another medical drama, but this show about a trauma centre in Pittsburgh revitalises the genre with its attention to the psychological stress on caregivers. Noah Wyle gives a shattering performance as the department head, the dedicated, harried, emotionally wracked Dr Robbie, still traumatised after failing to save his mentor during the Covid-19 pandemic. He is surrounded by other doctors and a group of students and interns, each adding a different dimension, from Supriya Ganesh as a brilliant medical prodigy to Isa Briones as an abrasive intern and Taylor Dearden as the caring Dr Mel, whose neurodivergence makes her especially empathetic with her patients. Unlike most medical shows, The Pitt never lets their personal melodrama overwhelm the focus on their work. Each absorbing, fast-paced episode takes place in real time during one 15-hour-long shift, and each veers between the devastation of losing patients and the relief of saving them. You'd think a series so blunt about death would be depressing, but instead The Pitt is exhilarating in its focus on people for whom life and death are everyday events. (CJ)\nAvailable on Max in the US\nIt's difficult to discuss the power of this show without giving away the key twist that comes at the end of episode one. But safe to say, it turns what starts as a relatively conventional political thriller on its head. Sterling K Brown is the head of the US president's security detail, who finds himself accused of murder of his boss \u2013 but above and beyond the killing itself, not everything seems quite right with the world. Created by Dan Fogelman, the man behind the equally rug-pulling TV weepie This is Us, this is solid entertainment in the very best sense, with sharp plotting matched by some strong performances, from Brown\u2019s tortured hero to Julianne Nicholson as a sinister tech billionaire. Plus, later on in the series, one particular episode which deals with truly monumental matters is simply breathtaking \u2013 but again, that's all that can be said without spoiling things for those yet to watch. The good news for those that have is that it's already been recommissioned. (HM)\nAvailable on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally\u00a0\nThe sumptuous conclusion to this adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall trilogy blends a beautifully shot escape into the luxurious past of Henry VIII's court with an evergreen depiction of the high personal cost of manoeuvring for power and influence. Mark Rylance is poignant as the king's advisor, Thomas Cromwell, who questions his own decisions, while the mercurial Henry is losing confidence in him. And Damian Lewis's fresh interpretation of Henry is dazzling, his voice and manner chillingly subdued even as he issues the most ruthless commands. Henry's wives come and go, but the unravelling bond between these men, and their opposite trajectories \u2013 Cromwell's self-doubts and decline and Henry's iron will that eliminates anyone in his way \u2013 shape the story. Written by Peter Straughn, a recent Oscar winner for his screenplay of Conclave, The Mirror and the Light is more resonant today than the original Mantel book was when it was published in 2020. It feels entirely relevant in a world where creeping authoritarianism is a global concern. (CJ)\nAvailable on PBS in the US and BBC iPlayer in the UK\nSince breaking out in HBO teen drama Euphoria, rising star Jacob Elordi has chosen his roles well \u2013 but perhaps nothing has served him better so far than returning to his home country of Australia to play the protagonist in this searing war drama. An adaptation of Richard Flanagan's Booker Prize-winning novel, it explores the life of World War Two army surgeon Dorrigo Evans across three time periods: his stint stationed in Adelaide for military training, his hellish experiences as a prisoner of war in the Thai jungle, and then his existence as a professionally successful but emotionally deeply troubled veteran (now played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), still unable to truly process the events of decades ago. Brought to impactful visual life by Justin Kurzel, known for his visceral studies of male violence on the big screen like Snowtown and The Order, it is simply one of the best evocations of the horrors of conflict that has been committed to screen. But at the same time, it takes as much care in its exploration of passion as violence, with the chemistry between Elordi's young Dorrigo and his uncle's wife Amy (a superb Odessa Young) burning up the screen. Given some of the scenes of sadistic brutality, it is of course a difficult watch, as it should be, but also one whose sheer artistry offers a kind of transcendence. (HM)\u00a0\nAvailable on Prime Video in the US, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada\nJon Hamm has never been better, expertly mixing comedy and drama in this series about a hedge-fund manager called Coop, who loses his job. He schemes to keep up appearances in his wealthy community, only to discover a new sense of himself. The show has a broad comic element, as Coop turns cat burglar, solving his financial problems by stealing luxury items from his neighbours. But the series is best in its bold take on what he calls in one of his mordant voiceovers, \"the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men\", and in its depiction of his complicated relationships. He is still emotionally attached to his ex-wife (Amanda Peet), who left him for one of his friends, and struggles to connect with his two teenage children. He has a tender, supportive bond with his emotionally fragile sister (Lena Hall, a standout in the cast). Hamm hasn't had a role this rich since Don Draper in Mad Men, another flawed but sympathetic charmer who makes some wildly bad decisions, and defines the character so perfectly that it's hard to imagine anyone else at the centre of this sleek but penetrating series. (CJ)\nAvailable on AppleTV+ internationally\nIt might have created a little less noise than Adolescence, but here is another British show about masculinity that really deserves to be seen. Jack Rooke's semi-autobiographical show about two university students who form an odd-couple friendship \u2013 nerdy gay man Jack and straight jack-the-lad Dan \u2013 has been an incredibly deft mix of laugh-out-loud humour, complete with delightfully niche pop culture references, and poignant drama \u2013 covering sexual awakening, depression, dementia and more besides \u2013 since it started in 2022. But this third and final series was undoubtedly its most powerful, kicking off with a hilarious episode on a package holiday in Greece but getting more serious as it continued, and handling Danny's spiralling mental health problems with particular skill. And boy, does Rooke know how to shatter audience hearts \u2013 the final episode is an emotional masterclass, including a significant cameo from the man himself. Here's hoping that it launches its extremely talented creator into the big time.

        "article_text": "In a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it \u2013 and that's what makes it magical.\nIn the Sandhills region of North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.\nThe region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.\nPeople largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm \u2013 think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.\nThe prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the \"cradle of American golf\", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.\nHunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and \u2013 the star attraction \u2013 imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nBut travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.\n\"It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,\" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.\nBurns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.\nDon Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (\u00a313) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about \u00a358) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.\nPlan your trip\n- If you\u2019re looking to purchase your own jar of amethyst treasure, keep an eye out online for availability toward late July. Dees Bees Apiary tends to sell in smaller increments so more people have the chance to try it.\n- At other times of year, drop into local shops and farmers' markets to taste the distinct honey varieties grown here, from sourwood to apple blossom to tupelo, and if you\u2019re lucky, some of the purple stuff, too.\n- Visitors can also take a honey tour with Honeybee Bliss, where suited-up guests play honey sommelier and take a turn at pulling bee-laden frames oozing with golden goo.\nDees' take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.\nHowever, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, \"to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way\".\nBurns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. \"One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it.\" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. \"Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.\nThere's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers \u2013 who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff \u2013 can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets \u2013 and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance has responded to Pope Francis's death, acknowledging his meeting with the pontiff on Easter Sunday.\n\"My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,\" Vance wrote in a statement posted to social media platform X. \"I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill.\"\nVance, who converted to Catholicism as an adult, had diplomatic meetings with Vatican officials over the weekend before he left Rome for India. \nHe followed his statement with a link to his favourite homily by the late Pope - a March 2020 address on fear and faith that was given during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe White House also offered condolences on X, with an unsigned statement that read: \"Rest in Peace, Pope Francis.\"\nThe meeting with Pope Francis was not originally on Vance's schedule for the trip to Italy. But sources had said Vance was hoping he could secure even a brief moment with the Pope - a personal goal for him as a Catholic, as well as a political one. \nThe pontiff was a long-time critic of US President Donald Trump. In 2016, he questioned then-presidential candidate Trump's faith, saying \"a person who thinks only about building walls... and not of building bridges, is not Christian\". \nRecently, he referred to Trump's immigration views as \"an ugly thing\", and his plans to ramp up deportations as a \"disgrace\". Caring for migrants was a signature issue for the Pope. \nVance has defended Trump's policies, sometimes invoking his own religious beliefs in response to the criticism. Still, his visit was aimed at thawing relations, insiders said.\nOn Saturday, Vance also met the Vatican's secretary of state and secretary for relations with states and international organisation.\nIn a statement, the Vatican described \"cordial talks\" on Saturday that affirmed \"good existing bilateral relations\" and a \"common commitment\" to protect freedom of religion.\nOn Sunday, Vance's office confirmed a visit to the Pope that lasted about 15 minutes. Vance \"expressed his gratitude to Pope Francis for inviting him to meet on Easter Sunday and for the hospitality the Vatican has extended to his family\".  \nVance converted to Catholicism in 2019, then in his mid-30s. He wrote that he found the family and social values of the Catholic Church appealing and of a part with his view of conservative politics.\nStill, amid his disagreements with Pope Francis on immigration, he acknowledged that his faith was newer and may differ from Pope Francis's, even as he revered the Pope. The US Catholic Church has at times clashed with Pope Francis, taking a more conservative approach to social issues.\nAt the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington in February, Vance referred to himself as a \"baby Catholic\" and said there were \"things about the faith that I don't know\".\nThe death of Pope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church, was announced on Monday. He was 88.\n\"This morning at 07:35 local time (05:35 GMT) the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father,\" Cardinal Kevin Farrell said in the statement, which was published by the Vatican on its Telegram channel.\nAlso on Sunday, Francis appeared at the Vatican's St Peter's Square to wish thousands of worshippers a happy Easter.\nHe had been discharged from hospital last month, after five weeks of treatment for an infection that led to double pneumonia.",

        "article_text": "Stock markets around the world have been relatively settled this week after a period of chaos, sparked by US trade tariffs.\nBut investors are still closely watching a part of the market which rarely moves dramatically - the US bond market.\nGovernments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest.\nRecently, in an extremely rare move the rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell.\nThe volatility suggests investors were losing confidence in the world's biggest economy.\nYou may think it's too esoteric to bother you, but here's why it matters and how it may change President Trump's mind on tariffs.\nWhen a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - known as \"Treasuries\" in the US -  to investors on financial markets.\nSuch payments are made over a number of pre-agreed years before a full and final payment is made when the bond \"matures\" - in other words, expires. \nInvestors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks like the Bank of England.\nInvestors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.\nSo when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds. \nBut recently that hasn't happened.\nInitially, following the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds. \nHowever, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend, investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.\nThe so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.\nWhy the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them. \nThe higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.\nIf the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself. \nBut it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.\nJohn Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.\nBusinesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.\nMr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.\nFirst-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.\nFollowing the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to \"hang tough\", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.\nFollowing the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.\nIt proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.\n\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.\nAccording to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump. \nThe bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.\nSome analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.\nWhile bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.\n\"Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,\" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.\nBut unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.\nSince 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.\nJapan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally. \nQuestions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.\nHowever, this is unlikely as any fire sale \"would impoverish China more than it would hurt the US\", according to Capital Economics.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nCeltic hit five past St Johnstone to cruise into Scottish Cup final\nNearly two years ago, when Brendan Rodgers was mulling over a return to the role of Celtic manager, he caught up with captain Callum McGregor.\nDuring Rodgers first spell at the helm, the midfielder was learning from the armband-wearing Scott Brown while continually nudging his level up a notch. \nAll the ingredients were there when Rodgers left, but when he returned, the McGregor masterpiece was fully made and the pair, who previously enjoyed so much success together, vowed to make more. \nWith three trophies in the cabinet since the Northern Irishman came back, another Premiership title edging ever closer, and a Scottish Cup final against Aberdeen to come, the indomitable duo of Rodgers and McGregor are sticking to their word.\n\"We were talking about trying to win as many trophies as we can, be as dominant as we can, keep pushing the club,\" McGregor said of that chat with Rodgers after opening the scoring in Sunday's thumping cup semi-final win over St Johnstone.\n\"He's a manager that's done so much for my career and put so much trust and faith in me, so, every time I go on the pitch I try and repay that for him. \n\"The best way to do that is by winning trophies.\"\nCeltic thrash St Johnstone to reach Scottish Cup final\nCeltic's Scottish Cup dominance in numbers\nMore Celtic reaction, analysis & fan views\nWith 23 trophies in 11 years, former Scotland international McGregor knows a thing or two about doing just that. He's a serial winner. \nLevel on accolades with Lisbon Lions captain Billy McNeill, only Bobby Lennox and current team-mate James Forrest are ahead of him on the roll of honour.\nShould Celtic seal the Premiership title - they can do so on Saturday against Dundee United - Forrest will move ahead, on his own, as the most decorated Celt. \nRather than focus on his own player of the match performance, he was keen to heap praise on his long-time pal who has \"dedicated his life\" to the club. \nMcGregor, 31, is at the stage where reaching, and winning, finals is \"normal\".\nThe Celtic captain will now prepare for a 15th domestic cup final.

You just keep wanting more and that's what we're trying to instil in the team. \n\"When we get to these moments, they become normal.

The Northern Irishman is on the cusp of his own slice of history, as the first Celtic manager to oversee three trebles.\nHis first was secured in the most dramatic of fashions against Aberdeen in 2017, with Tom Rogic's extra-time goal clinching the Scottish Cup.\nSince then, what used to be a rare achievement has become a yearly target for Celtic, Rodgers and \"the glue\" to it all, McGregor.\nEven from afar, the understanding the pair have is evident. The manager fleetingly singles players out, but he's never shy to do so with his captain. \n\"He is such a unique player, the tempo setter for the team,\" Rodgers told BBC Scotland after the St Johnstone game. \"He's tactically so good, he really is a coach on the pitch. \n\"He sees all the pictures we want and he knows when to release himself to shoot or create goals. A wonderful player who is the glue for this team.\"\nWhen McGregor is missing - rare as that is - it's undeniably noticeable. See the defeat by Rangers last month for a recent example. \nBut with him, Celtic are a different animal.",

        "article_text": "The Fantasy Premier League season heads straight into a second straight double gameweek.\nWith only four teams playing twice in week 33 - Manchester City, Aston Villa, Arsenal and Crystal Palace - you'll probably see a lot of similar teams among your rivals and FPL experts at the moment, but there are still gains to be made if you play it smart.\nHere's BBC Sport's team of the week and the answers to some key questions for gameweek 33.\nThere is one standout option this week - Arsenal's Bukayo Saka.\nIf you knew Saka was going to play twice, he is the most exciting pick, with Ipswich away and Palace at home.\nDoes Mikel Arteta rest him? Arsenal have Newcastle breathing down their neck for second place and keep dropping points so the Gunners boss can't afford too much rotation.\nThey also have a six-day break between the Palace game and their Champions League semi-final against Paris St-Germain.\nI'm confident Saka plays at least 120 minutes this gameweek and probably more.\nGameweek 33 is the best chance to Bench Boost before the end of the season, even if we get another double in 36.\nIf you have 15 playing assets and you like the match-ups for most of them, then pull the trigger.\nThe main issue is game time - there are not a lot of nailed-on assets among Arsenal, City or Villa. Palace are a little more predictable but all four teams might have their minds on cup competitions.\nSo make your peace with the fact that there will be benchings and play that chip. \nDon't be going mad shipping out good single gameweek players to squeeze another double option into your team.\nLiverpool - face woeful Leicester so Mohamed Salah is a must and Virgil van Dijk has as good a clean sheet chance as any double gameweek defender.\nWest Ham - Jarrod Bowen jumps out as the Hammers host relegated Southampton. You should also be confident starting a West Ham defensive asset.\nManchester United - Wolves at home could be productive for Bruno Fernandes. Four of his five double-digit hauls this season have come against teams in the bottom five (at the time).\nI'd also advise against taking too many hits to bring in double gameweek players - a -4 can pay off. Any more and you are asking for a lot to go your way to make up that difference.\nIt's hard to go back to defender Daniel Munoz, who finished with -1 points in gameweek 32. He's still super attacking - with eight entries into the box in 32 - and was close to an assist, but Bournemouth and Arsenal are both likely to score against Palace.\nBut I'd still put your faith in attacking assets such as Eberechi Eze, Ismaila Sarr and Jean-Philippe Mateta, especially if they are already in your team. \nNo need to sell, hard to predict if any will be rested for the FA Cup and all three have haul potential. Eze could have had three goals last week, for example, but for a very tight offside call and missed penalty.\nDefence was nearly a debacle, with a combined four points from four players - but Kieran Trippier's 12-pointer saved the day.\nJacob Murphy (19 points) was the star man but 70 points is still disappointing for a double gameweek.\nListen to the latest Fantasy 606 podcast on BBC Sounds.\nDavid Raya, Arsenal, keeper, \u00a35.5m\nWilliam Saliba, Arsenal, \u00a36.5m\nBoth face Ipswich (a) and Crystal Palace (h)\nThe two most reliable Arsenal defensive assets in a week where they could easily get two clean sheets. Boring, I know, but very steady.\nVirgil van Dijk, Liverpool, \u00a36.6m - Leicester (a)\nLeicester scored last week but lost their previous eight games without scoring. The most nailed-on clean sheet shout this week.\nHe's a better pick than a double option from Palace - see above - and Villa who have three clean sheets in their past four games, but are unlikely to get one this week.\nJosko Gvardiol, Manchester City, \u00a36.2m - Everton (a), Villa (h)\nThe Croatian has 16 points in his past three games and you can't turn down this double gameweek. He's City's best defensive asset as we all know.\nThis video can not be played\nNo-shows & Bench Boost woes\nBukayo Saka (captain), Arsenal, \u00a310.5m - Ipswich (a), Palace (h)\nFor the reasons stated above, I'd be confident about Saka's minutes this week. Yes he is coming back from injury but he also needs game time to get his fitness up.\nFrom past experience, he could easily get double digits in both of these games so he gets the armband.\nMohamed Salah (vice-captain), Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - Leicester (a)\nLast gameweek was the first since week eight in which Salah's net transfers were negative. People are selling him but don't be one of them.\nAnd if you are risk averse, or worried about game time for your doublers, Salah would make a very safe captain choice.\nMorgan Rogers, Aston Villa, \u00a35.6m - Newcastle (h), Man City (a)\nTurns out it was daft to think Rogers might get a rest last week. He's become a player who starts every game for Villa. This double is not exciting for them but Rogers is the only Villa forward asset you can truly expect to start both matches and you do fancy them to score in both games.\nJarrod Bowen, West Ham, \u00a37.5m - Southampton (h)\nThis match-up is too juicy to pass up for West Ham's talisman. Bowen's having a 7/10 season so far, but he still has four double-digit hauls.\nIn his past six games he has had 17 shots, 12 in the box. Bowen usually overperforms his expected goals (xG) yet he has just one goal in that time from 1.4 xG, suggesting he might be due.\nEberechi Eze, Crystal Palace, \u00a36.9m - Bournemouth (h), Arsenal (a)\nAs the week draws closer, I'm becoming more and more convinced Palace boss Oliver Glasner rests some key players in the Arsenal match, with little to play for in the league and an FA Cup semi-final four days later.\nBut Eze is still worth a punt. As mentioned above, he could have hauled in week 32 and we'd then be looking at him very differently.\nHe's Palace's key player and could very well start both matches and get brought off with 20 minutes to go.\nWest Ham's Jarrod Bowen has 16 goal involvements this season\nOmar Marmoush, Manchester City, \u00a37.3m - Everton (a), Villa (h)\nThree goals in his past four games and a great differential Triple Captain shout if you don't own Saka.\nIf you've owned and watched Marmoush play in those four games, you'll be feeling like he could have scored more and his underlying statistics back that up.\nThe Egyptian has had 18 shots, 10 on target, 10 in the box, four big chances - he is a haul waiting to happen.\nEvanilson, Bournemouth, \u00a35.8m - Crystal Palace (a)\nSince the Brazilian made his first start on his return from injury five games ago, he has led the way among strikers in almost every category.\nWolves striker Jorgen Strand Larsen (5) is the only forward with more goals than Evanilson's four, but the Bournemouth man has had the most shots in the box (16), the most big chances (7) and the highest xG (4.44).\nHe can take advantage of a Palace defence that has conceded nine in the past two games.\nAlphonse Areola, West Ham, keeper, \u00a34.2m - Southampton (h)\nMax Kilman, West Ham, defender, \u00a34.3m - Southampton (h)\nIliman Ndiaye, Everton, striker, \u00a35.2m - Manchester City (h)\nJan Bednarek, Southampton, defender, \u00a34m - West Ham (a)\n\nTeal total cost: \u00a399.9m\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a \u00a3100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\nJust the 18 goals and three assists for Chris Wood this season.

Call it lost my bottle. You sometimes lose your nerve. Just to come here is an achievement for me.\n\"The kind of nerves I have [been] feeling off and on for the last two years have not been good nerves. I have just been not wanting to go out there - sometimes struggling to even take my eyes off the floor. The confidence has been draining away, so it has not been a great place to be.\"\nNext Tuesday's meeting with Carter, who at 18th in the world is the highest ranked qualifier, is a repeat of the 2008 and 2012 Crucible finals, which were both won by 'The Rocket'.\nThe pair also contested a Masters final in 2024, which O'Sullivan triumphed in, but there were genuine fears that he would not go for a record eighth world title in the modern era this year having been an ever-present at the sport's showpiece event since turning professional in 1992. \nHe pulled out of the Masters at Alexandra Palace on medical grounds, missed the German Masters in Berlin and apologised to fans after electing not to play at the Welsh Open.\nHe also withdrew from the World Grand Prix in Hong Kong in March and has not played in anything over a best-of-seven match since his first-round loss to Barry Hawkins at the UK Championship in November.\n\"Ali is a really good match player and I will have to play better than I have been just to give him a game,\" added O'Sullivan. \n\"I really have nothing to lose. I have done well to just get here to be honest. If it was any other tournament I probably wouldn't have come.\n\"I don't know how excited I am because the reason I stopped was because my game was suffering and I wasn't getting anything from it. Not much has changed but I thought at some point I have to try and play.\n\"I am always mentally ready, that has not been a problem. I always find a way to get through any situation but with my game technically I am at a loss with it and I have never been in this situation before in my life. I have never experienced this and it is hard especially at this stage in my career, you sometimes think 'is it worth trying to rebuild?'\" \nWilson, O'Sullivan, Trump, Selby - who will win World Snooker Championship?\nWorld Championship: Match schedule & BBC coverage\nWilson to face Lei, O'Sullivan v Carter at World Championship\nIn the build-up to the 17-day tournament, O'Sullivan said that he received \"a proper good hiding\" while practising with world number 11 Barry Hawkins. \nHowever, recent footage of him constructing a maximum 147 break in less than seven minutes in practice suggests he is acclimatising well to a new cue. \n\"It is the second time I broke my cue. The first time was a similar situation, I was struggling for maybe a year or two and you just get tired in the end and so frustrated,\" O'Sullivan added. \n\"That was kind of like the end of my tether. Obviously regretted it but that is how the game got me.\" \nO'Sullivan, who has won a record 41 ranking titles, also outlined that he is not ready to pack away his cue just yet.\n\"I'd like to do another two or three years playing so the aim is to try and just focus on this event,\" he continued.\n\"The longer term thing is to play another two or three years and finish semi-positive on a career that has been good to me. You need to find a cue you like and I have got one I am kind of happy with.\"\nMark Selby and Ronnie O'Sullivan contested the 2014 World Championship final\nO'Sullivan has previously stressed that he has had to take medication to deal with anxiety and also had a candid studio discussion on TNT Sports, external with Mark Selby earlier this season around the mental health pressures faced by snooker players. \nThat prompted some debate around the potential for players to be offered a counsellor at tournaments to help them deal with issues. \nAnd four-time world champion Selby, who has had well-documented struggles of his own to contend with, believes that service would be a valuable addition to the professional tour.\n\"I don't think we have carried on and progressed with it but I think something definitely needs to happen,\" Selby told BBC Sport. \n\"Ronnie hit the nail on the head. There are probably a lot more players on the tour going through it than you think that just don't speak out or feel strong enough to speak out. \n\"If you had someone like that there, who you could go in a room with for 20 minutes or half an hour to speak to, a neutral person, to get things off your chest, it would be a great addition to the tour for all the players. You would definitely use it for sure.\" \nSelby, 41, also believes that O'Sullivan did the right thing by taking some time away from snooker.\n\"He obviously wasn't in the greatest place to miss all these tournaments. He must be suffering a lot off the table. If I look back at how I was last year going into the World Championship, if I was in the same position now coming in as I was 12 months ago, there is no way I would be playing. \n\"I would pull out and I have learnt from that, and know if I am in the same position I won't make that mistake again.\n\"He's definitely done the right thing. At the end of the day it is a game of snooker and you have to put yourself first and be selfish. \n\"That is what he has done. If he feels as though he is in a better headspace to go and give himself a chance to win the tournament he is doing the right thing to play.\"",

These restrictions will rise incrementally over the following 22 years.\nThe announcement came as global trade is already being disrupted by Trump's trade tariffs, experts have said.\nCargoes originally destined for ports in the US from China are instead being redirected to European ports, a trade group said.\nBusinesses have warned this will raise prices for US consumers.\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.\nHis administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nThese tariffs have caused \"significant build ups\" of ships, especially in the European Union, but also \"significant congestion\" at UK ports, according to Marco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade.\nMore containers are coming to the UK, he said.\n\"We've seen a lot of diversion of ships from China, that were due to head to the US, diverting and coming to the UK and into the EU.\"\nIn the first three months of 2025, Chinese imports into the UK have increased by about 15% and into the EU by about 12%.\n\"That's a direct impact of what President Trump is doing,\" he said, adding that uncertainty and increased disruption pushes up prices for consumers.\nSanne Manders, president of logistics firm Flexport, said both tariffs and strikes at ports in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium in the first three months of the year had been \"clogging\" ports.\nCongestion in the UK \"is particularly severe in Felixstowe\", while in continental Europe Rotterdam and Barcelona are \"also pretty severe\".\n\"I do believe that if more cargo is going to be routed towards Europe, finding new buyers that will drive up the volumes even further, that could lead to more congestion,\" he said - although terminals would be open for more hours per day in the summer due to better weather.\nHe said shippers were looking for new markets, but that also there may be a surge of goods to the US to try to take advantage of that 90-day window for goods from some countries.\nHe said in the US, consumers would pay for the tariffs, but European consumers would not see \"much impact\".\nCompanies would also probably start redesigning their supply chains, he said.",

        "article_text": "From nightmares to severe backache, three people with Parkinson's have shared their symptoms and experiences to offer insight into what it is like to live a day in their shoes.\nThe progressive disorder affects the brain, nervous system, and muscle control. It is the fastest growing neurological condition in the world, with about 153,000 people in the UK living with the condition.\nAlison Anderson from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, is one of those people. Like many, she awakes at about 08:00 to the twinkling crescendo of her morning alarm. \nBut unlike many others, this sound shatters the silence six more times throughout her day, reminding her to take her medication. \nThe slightest delay in her dosage, known as off-time, risks her symptoms surfacing and her experiencing anything from tremors to memory difficulties or poor balance.\n\"When this happens, even the simplest of tasks becomes challenging,\" she said. \n\"I become mentally and physically slower, I can't think straight and struggle to speak without forgetting what I'm trying to say. \n\"It's frustrating, at times embarrassing, and it interferes with pretty much everything I'm trying to do,\" she said.\nMs Anderson was diagnosed with the condition in 2015, which at the time came as a \"devastating\" blow.\nBut over the years, she has gradually \"learned to adjust\" to her symptoms, and even discovered a \"slower pace of life\" has made her more appreciative.\nThe 54-year-old has found a close-knit community comprised of four other women with the disease, whom she meets with every week for coffee, cake and a catch-up.\n\"Because we are all facing similar challenges, we are uniquely placed to help and support each other,\" she said.\n\"We also encourage, and at times, coerce each other into trying new things and keeping active. I try to enjoy life and live it to the fullest.\"\nOther symptoms of Parkinson's can include sensory issues, voice changes, facial masking\u00a0- where people experience a reduced ability to express emotions through facial movements - and sleep difficulties. \nAs Glyn Evans from Lydney explains: \"You get distressing dreams most nights. I wake up every couple of hours, sometimes in a ball of sweat.\" \nMr Evans was diagnosed with Parkinson's tremor after noticing a slight shake in his right hand several years ago.\nThis quickly progressed to jaw and tongue tremors, stiffness, severe backache and loss of balance. \nThe 78-year-old said life continues regardless, and he has \"found ways to cope\" with the condition.\n\"What would I say to people about my condition? Don't feel sorry for me,\" he said.\n\"Try to understand that Parkinson's has changed my life but it won't kill me.\"\nMichael Pearce, from Hardwicke, told the BBC his symptoms manifest in the form of fatigue, mobility issues, tremors and urinary incontinence. \n\"I'm very self-conscious at times, frustrated and uncertain,\" he said. \"But only once or twice did I get angry about it. It's nobody's fault, it just is.\n\"The other big thing for me was I stopped being creative. I used to write songs and my sense of humour diminished. Thankfully, these are coming back.\"\nMr Pearce said prescribed medication has since improved his quality of life, but true acceptance of his diagnosis came from within. \n\"I endeavour not to worry about an unknown future,\" he explained.\n\"Parkinson's has been a wake up call about life's priorities, not taking people and things for granted.\n\"This definitely helped in my case, keeping me grounded and philosophical about the situation. I express gratitude for the things I can still do.\" \nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram. Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump and Giorgia Meloni talked up the chances of a trade deal between the US and Europe, as the Italian prime minister visited Washington.\n\"There will be a trade deal, 100%,\" Trump said, \"but it will be a fair deal\", while Meloni said she was \"sure\" they could reach an agreement, later adding that her aim was to \"make the West great again\".\nMeloni is the first European leader to visit Washington since Trump imposed, then paused, 20% tariffs on imports from the bloc.\nThe US president separately said on Thursday that he is confident of making \"a very good deal\" with China, adding that representatives from Beijing have reached out \"a number of times\". \nTrump and Meloni enjoy a good relationship and the Italian leader hopes to position herself as a bridge between the EU and the US amid fractured relations and mounting concerns about the global impact of Trump's tariffs.\nDespite his confidence in an eventual deal, Trump said he was in \"no rush\".\n\"Everybody wants to make a deal. And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them,\" he said, adding that he expects to cut deals with every country \"over the next three to four weeks\".\nTrump also suggested that he was reluctant to further raise tariffs on China - which currently stand at 145%. \n\"I may not want to go higher. I may want to go to less because you know, you want people to buy and, at a certain point, people aren't gonna buy,\" he told reporters at the White House.\nAt a press conference on Thursday following Trump's and Meloni's conversation, the leaders said they had discussed defence spending, immigration and tariffs.\nThe atmosphere in the Oval Office appeared relaxed and good-natured - similar to the reception UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received during his visit to the White House in February.\nHowever Meloni's aides had described the visit as a \"commercial peace mission\" following Trump's decision to impose a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US. \nHe has strongly criticised the European Union on trade, claiming it was \"formed to screw the United States\". A 20% \"retaliatory\" tariff on the EU has been temporarily suspended until July.\nMeloni previously called the tariffs \"absolutely wrong\" and said they would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".\nWhile she didn't score any tangible wins on tariffs during the meeting, she did convince Trump to accept an invitation to visit Rome, which she said would be an occasion for him to meet other European leaders.\nGiven the fraught relations between the EU and the US, Meloni will likely chalk that up as a significant win, particularly if Trump agrees to meet the president of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, during the visit.\nMeloni will return to Europe with stronger credentials as the so-called \"Trump whisperer\", something that will be reinforced when she meets US Vice President JD Vance in Rome tomorrow.\nThe Italian leader was careful to praise Trump and align herself with the US president's viewpoints.\nIn her statement following the meeting, she criticised \"woke ideology\" and championed the \"war against illegal migration\".\n\"The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together,\" she added.\nShe also seized the opportunity to tout the work of her own government. \"I'm proud of sitting here as prime minister of an Italy that today has a very good situation - a stable country, a reliable country,\" Meloni said. \nShe noted that her government had brought inflation down and improved employment, before gesturing towards Trump and adding with a broad smile: \"Forgive me if I promote my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me\". Trump grinned back.\nMeloni basked in the praise lavished on her by Trump - from compliments about her work as prime minister to gushing about her Italian sounding \"beautiful\".\nThe US president praised Meloni for taking a tough stance on immigration and said he wished more people were like her. Meloni said that change was happening, thanks to the example set by Italy, referring to yesterday's EU announcement on safe countries.\nIt was only occasionally that she showed a tinge of irritation when asked about Italy's low defence spending.\nMeloni said that she expects Italy to announce at the next Nato meeting in June that her country would be able to meet the alliance's requirement that each member nation spends 2% of GDP on defence.\nDefence spending has been a key sticking point for Trump, with the US leader repeatedly demanding that Nato allies increase spending. \nItaly is one of eight countries that currently does not meet the 2% threshold, spending 1.49% on defence.\nItalian opposition leader Carlo Calenda said there had been \"two very positive outcomes\" from the visit: that Meloni \"stayed on track on Ukraine and managed to convince Trump to meet EU figures in Italy\".\nCalenda said Meloni had \"gained credibility as a bridge between the US and the EU\" but criticised her praise of \"Trump's fight on woke culture\".",

        "article_text": "When US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in his first term, Vietnamese entrepreneur Hao Le saw an opportunity.\nHis company is one of hundreds of businesses that have emerged to compete with Chinese exports that have increasingly been facing restrictions from the West.\nLe's SHDC Electronics, which sits in the budding industrial hub of Hai Duong, sells $2m (\u00a31.5m) worth of phone and computer accessories every month to the United States.\nBut that revenue could dry up if Trump imposes 46% tariffs on Vietnamese goods, a plan that is currently on hold until early July.  That would be \"catastrophic for our business,\" Le says. \nAnd selling to Vietnamese consumers is not an option, he adds: \"We cannot compete with Chinese products. This is not just our challenge. Many Vietnamese companies are struggling in their own home market.\"\nTrump tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers. But they also opened new doors for other businesses, often into global supply chains that wanted to cut their dependence on China.   \nBut Trump 2.0 threaten to shut those doors, which it sees as an unacceptable loophole. And that's a blow for fast-growing economies like Vietnam and Indonesia that are gunning to be key players in industries from chips to electric vehicles.\nThey also find themselves stuck between the world's two biggest economies - China, a powerful neighbour and their biggest trading partner, and the US, a key export market, which could be looking to strike a deal at Beijing's expense.\nAnd so Xi Jinping's long-planned trip to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week took on fresh urgency.\nAll three countries rolled out the the red carpet for him, but Trump saw it as more evidence of them conspiring to \"screw\" the US.\nThe White House will use its upcoming negotiations with smaller nations to pressure them into limiting their dealings with Beijing, according to reports. \nBut that could be a fanciful ambition given the amount of money flowing between   China and South East Asia.   \nIn 2024, China earned a record $3.5tn from exports - 16% of those went to South East Asia, its biggest market. Beijing, in turn, has paid for railways in Vietnam, dams in Cambodia and ports in Malaysia as part of its \"Belt and Road\" infratructure programme that seeks to boost ties abroad. \n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC on Tuesday, ahead of Xi's visit.\n\"If the issue is about something that we feel is against our interest, then we will protect [ourselves].\"\nIn the days after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariffs, South East Asian governments scrambled into deal-making mode.\nIn what Trump described as a \"very productive call\" with Vietnamese leader To Lam, the latter offered to completely scrap tariffs on US goods. \nThe US market is crucial to Vietnam, an emerging electronics powerhouse where manufacturing giants like Samsung, Intel and Foxconn, the Taiwanese firm contracted to make iPhones, have set up shop.\nMeanwhile, Thai officials are headed to Washington with a plan that includes higher US imports and investments. The US is their largest export market, so they are hoping to avoid the 36% levy on Thailand that Trump may reinstate.\n\"We will tell the US government that Thailand is not only an exporter but also an ally and economic partner that the US can rely on in the long term,\" Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said.\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has ruled out retaliation against Trump's tariffs, instead choosing to emphasise their economic and political importance to the US.\n\"We understand the concerns of the US,\" Mr Zafrul told the BBC. \"That's why we need to show that actually we, Asean, especially Malaysia, can be that bridge.\"\nIt's a role that South East Asia's export-driven economies have played well - they have benefitted from both Chinese and US trade and investment. But Trump's paused levies could derail that.\nTake Malaysia, for instance. In recent years, chip manufacturers from the US and elsewhere have invested there, as Washington blocks the sale of advanced tech to China. Last year China imported $18bn worth of chips from Malaysia. These chips are used in Chinese-made electronics, such as iPhones, typically bound for the US. \nTrump's proposed tariffs on Malaysia - 24% - could cut off the multi-billion dollar US market. But that's not all. \n\"If this continues, then companies will have to rethink their investment commitments,\" Mr Zafrul says. \"This will have an impact not just on Malaysia's economy, but on the global economy.\"\nThen there is Indonesia, which could face 32% tariffs, and is home to vast nickel reserves and has its sights set on the global electric vehicle supply chain.\nCambodia, a Chinese ally, faces the steepest levies: 49%. One of the poorest countries in the region, it has thrived as a trans-shipment hub for Chinese businesses seeking to skirt US tariffs. Chinese businesses currently own or operate 90% of the clothes factories, which mainly export to the US.\nTrump may have hit pause on these tariffs but \"the damage is done,\" says Doris Liew, an economist at Malaysia's Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs.\n\"This serves as a wake-up call for the region, not only to reduce reliance on the US, but also to re-balance overdependence on any single trade and export partner.\"\nIn these uncertain times , Xi Jinping is trying to send a steadfast message: Let's join hands and resist \"bullying\" from the US.\nThat is no easy task because South East Asia also has trade tensions with Beijing. \nIn Indonesia, business owner Isma Savitri is worried that Trump's 145% tariffs on China means more competition from Chinese rivals who can no longer export to the US. \n\"Small businesses like us feel squeezed,\" says the owner of sleepwear brand Helopopy. \"We are struggling to survive against an onslaught of ultra-cheap Chinese products.\"\nOne of Helopopy's popular pyjamas sells for $7.10 (119,000 Indonesian rupiah). Isma says she has seen similar designs from China going for around half that price.\n\"South East Asia, being close by, with open trade regimes and fast-growing markets, naturally became the dumping ground,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"Politically, many countries are reluctant to confront Beijing, which adds another layer of vulnerability.\"\nWhile consumers have welcomed competitively-priced Chinese products - from clothes to shoes to phones - thousands of local businesses have not been able to match such low prices.\nMore than 100 factories in Thailand have closed every month for the last two years, according to an estimate from a Thai think tank. During the same period in Indonesia, around 250,000 textile workers were laid off after some 60 garment manufacturers shut, local trade associations say  - including Sritex, once the region's largest textile maker.\n\"When we see the news, there are lots of imported products flooding the domestic market, which messes up our own market,\" Mujiati, a worker who was laid off from Sritex in February after 30 years, tells the BBC.\n\"Maybe it just wasn't our luck,\" says the 50-year-old, who is still hunting for work. \"Who can we complain to? There's no-one.\"\nSouth East Asian governments responded with a wave of protectionism, as local businesses demanded to be shielded from the impact of Chinese imports.\nLast year Indonesia considered 200% tariffs on a range of Chinese goods and blocked e-commerce site Temu, popular among Chinese merchants. Thailand tightened inspections of imports and imposed additional tax on goods worth less than 1,500 Thai baht ($45; \u00a334).\nThis year Vietnam has twice imposed temporary anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel products. And after Trump's latest tariffs announcement, Vietnam is reportedly set to crack down on Chinese goods being trans-shipped via its territory to the US.\nAllaying these fears would have been on Xi's agenda this week. \nChina is concerned that channelling its US-bound exports to the rest of the world would \"end up really alienating and aggravating\" its trading partners, David Rennie, the former Beijing bureau chief for the Economist newspaper, told BBC's Newshour.\n\"If a tidal wave of Chinese exports ends up swamping those markets and damaging employment and jobs \u2026 that's a massive diplomatic and geopolitical headache for the Chinese leadership.\"\nChina has not always had an easy relationship with this region. Barring Laos, Cambodia and a war-torn Myanmar, the others are wary of Beijing's ambitions. Territorial disputes in the South China have soured ties with the Philippines. This is also an issue with others such as Vietnam and Malaysia, but trade has been a balancing factor. \nBut that might change now, experts say. \n\"South East Asia had to think about whether they really wanted to offend China. Now this complicates things,\" says Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore. \nChina's loss could be South East Asia's gain. \nHao Le, in Vietnam, says he has seen a surge in enquiries from American customers scouting for new electronics suppliers, outside of China: \"In the past, US buyers would take months to switch suppliers. Today, such decisions are made within days.\"\nMalaysia, with sprawling rubber plantations and the world's largest medical rubber glove maker, has nearly half the world's market for rubber gloves. But it is poised to grab a bigger share from its main competitor, China.   \nThe region still faces a 10% baseline tariff, like most of the world. And that is bad news, says Oon Kim Hung, president of the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association. \nBut even if the paused tariffs kick in, he says, customers will find paying an additional 24% on Malaysian gloves vastly preferable to the 145% levy they will have to cough up for Chinese-made gloves.\n\"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit our manufacturers, as well as those in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.\"\nAdditional reporting by Abhiram V Subramaniam",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer.\nThe controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages.\n\"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\"\nWhite House officials have played down the reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it.\nTrump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary.\n\"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media. That's an old one. Try finding something new,\" he said. \nTrump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea that was also floated by Hegseth himself earlier Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".\nHegseth did not directly respond to the story about the second Signal chat, which was initially reported by the New York Times.\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.\nThe messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nOfficials used the group to discuss information relating to upcoming strikes in Yemen. Goldberg left the original chat after the first attacks on 14 March, but the two group chats appeared to discuss the same military operation that took place over several weeks.\nThe White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, although critics of Hegseth - including former US defence officials - question that. They say discussing such information in Signal groups could jeopardise US personnel carrying out military operations.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only the sender of the message and its recipients can view its contents. \nThis is considered a high level of security for a messaging app. But it offers no protection if someone's phone is viewed by another person or falls into the wrong hands, or if the wrong person is added to a group chat.\nExperts say this is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on officials' private devices.\nThe existence of the second Signal group is the latest controversy surrounding the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth denounced the reporters, and said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\" before turning away from the cameras. \nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, a former top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, accused the \"Trump-hating media\" of \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nThe Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nUS air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The Houthi-led government said the attack constituted a \"war crime\".",

        "article_text": "Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.\nRice is a staple food for more than half of the global population. It is consumed on a daily basis by more people than either wheat or maize, also known as corn.\nSo it is with some concern that scientists have unveiled a recent finding: that as carbon emissions rise and the Earth continues to warm, so too will arsenic levels in rice.\nThe presence of arsenic in rice has long been known as a problem. Almost all rice contains arsenic. The harmful, naturally occurring chemical can accumulate in the soil of paddy fields, leaching into the grains of rice grown there. But the amounts found in rice grains can vary considerably from well below the recommended limits set by regulatory bodies to several times higher.\nYet, consuming even low amounts of inorganic arsenic through food or drinking water can lead to cancers and a range of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nResearchers around the world have been working on ways to reduce the levels of arsenic in rice \u2013 and in the meantime, there are ways of cooking it that can extract some of this harmful element from grains (see the box further down the story for more).\nBut a new study of inorganic arsenic accumulation has found it may become a greater problem due to climate change. The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.\nThey found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.\n\"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health \u2013 it's a long laundry list,\" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. \"And two metrics of climate change \u2013 the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures \u2013 are resulting in greater amounts.\"\nIt's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions \"business as usual\" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.\nWhile the researchers focused on locations in China for their experiments, they say such impacts are likely to be seen in rice grown in regions including Europe and the US too, as inorganic arsenic is common in rice grown around the world.\n\"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature \u2013 but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us,\" says Ziska.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 Saving Italy's polluted sea\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\nOf course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice \u2013 so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.\nStill, this is \"one of the most comprehensive studies\" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study. \"This is as robust as you\u2019re ever likely to get.\"\nHumans have known for hundreds of years that arsenic is toxic. Its tasteless, colourless, odourless nature even made it a preferred method for dispatching enemies in the courts of ancient Rome and medieval Europe. But in single doses at trace amounts, it does not cause poisoning.\nOver the last few decades scientists have discovered that even lower amounts of arsenic can cause health impacts when exposure happens chronically over a lifetime.\nThis is particularly true of inorganic arsenic, which is more readily able to attach to biomolecules in the human body where it can cause harm. While naturally occurring in rocks and soils, inorganic arsenic can be a byproduct of activities like mining, coal burning and other industrial processes. (Read more about why \"natural\" doesn\u2019t always mean better).\nThis means inorganic arsenic is particularly prevalent in the groundwater in a number of regions, including South America and parts of southern and central Asia. But people elsewhere are vulnerable too: in the US, for example, more than 7% of private well owners, or 2.1 million people, are drinking dangerous levels of inorganic arsenic. Worldwide, some 140 million people drink water with arsenic levels above the WHO-recommended guidelines.\u00a0\nAnd, outside of drinking water, the main source of dietary exposure to arsenic worldwide is rice. In regions that tend to have little arsenic in their groundwater, like Europe, rice is the single biggest source of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.\nLowering the arsenic in your rice\nIf you want to lower your arsenic exposure from rice, there are a few things you can do.\nFirst, some types of rice have more inorganic arsenic than others. White rice has a lower inorganic arsenic content than brown rice but has less nutritional value. Basmati rice has less inorganic arsenic than other varieties. And rice from certain areas, including east Africa, has less arsenic than rice from other areas, including parts of the US, Europe, and south-east Asia.\nResearchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK also recently discovered a way of cooking rice that can remove 50% of the arsenic in brown rice and 74% from white rice. They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.\nThe UK's Food Standard's Agency recommends rinsing your rice before cooking and then boiling it in six parts water to one part rice before draining and rinsing again.\nThe problem comes down to how around 75% of the world's supply of rice is grown, says Ziska \u2013 in irrigated paddy fields.\nRice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. \"That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe,\" Ziska says. \"But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil.\" In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate reactions with other minerals in the soil that make the arsenic more bioavailable and easier for the rice plants to absorb through their root systems.\n\"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own,\" Ziska says. It changes the microbiome of the soil in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.\nAnd this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. \"This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active,\" Ziska says. \"It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy.\"\nZiska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.\nWhat worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment of inorganic arsenic's \"cancer potency factor\", taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that \"arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed\", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the risk of skin cancer, but lung and bladder cancers.\nAside from cancer, inorganic arsenic raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes. When consumed by pregnant women, it also makes foetal or infant mortality more likely, as well as raises the risk that the infant will be born low birth weight \u2013 which can have lifelong health impacts such as cardiovascular disease \u2013 or have developmental neurocognitive effects.\nFor individuals, the risks are slight. For example, the latest EPA review found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day \u2013 or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person \u2013 would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.\nBut across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.\nInorganic arsenic\nIf everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, the EPA calculates that \u2013 compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic \u2013 an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.\nThe amount of inorganic arsenic in rice varies enormously. But one study found that the global median amount is 66 micrograms per kg of rice. The EU set a limit in 2023 on inorganic arsenic in rice at 200 micrograms per kg of rice.\nSo, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?\n\"We can't pretend that we're going to take rice off the table. That's not feasible,\" says Nachman. As well as an important food tradition, rice is important to people living in poverty, some of whom get up to half of their daily calories from rice alone. \"But we need to do something differently.\"\nResearchers have also been experimenting with whether different types of water management could reduce arsenic levels. One process \u2013 where, instead of flooding a field continuously, the field is partly flooded, drained and then flooded again \u2013 does seem to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic. \"But that just increases cadmium,\" Marham says. \"And cadmium is perceived as an even bigger threat.\" Cadmium can cause breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancers, as well as liver and kidney disease.\nThere is also interest in trying to breed varieties of rice that take up less inorganic arsenic, but this hasn't yet panned out, researchers say.\nBecause some types of rice accumulate less inorganic arsenic, there is interest in exploring their cultivation. Another solution might be adding sulphur to water, which can absorb electrons, like arsenic. Another way to shift the microbiome of fields could be adding certain types of fertiliser \u2013 one combination found to decrease arsenic content has been a mix of mountain thyme and bird manure. But more research on any of these approaches is needed.\nAnother approach may be to grow rice under rainwater-fed conditions, or where both the soil and irrigation water are lower in arsenic. Rice from East Africa, which tends to be rainwater- rather than irrigation-fed, has been found to be particularly low in inorganic arsenic, as has rice in Indonesia. Rice grown in the US, Central and South America, south-east Asia, Europe and Australia all have been found to have higher amounts of arsenic.\nThere also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say. \"Policymakers have been dragging their feet for decades on this,\" says Marham.\u00a0\nCurrently, the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate arsenic levels in rice but has set a limit of 0.1mg/kg of rice intended for consumption by children. In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.\n\"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown,\" Ziska says. \"It really needs attention, because it affects so many individuals globally.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Trading cryptocurrency was just a bit of fun for Tzoni Raykov, but losing $1,500 worth to an administrative error has left him with serious concerns about his treatment by the industry.\nThe oil engineer has held an account with Revolut for several years - using its app to split bills with friends after going out for dinner or drinks. They would pay each other using traditional currency, like the pound sterling or US dollar.\nBut after seeing the e-money firm advertise its cryptocurrency services, he decided to give it a try.\nWhat Tzoni thought would be a straightforward transfer of cryptocurrency coins has left the Bulgarian national angry and out of pocket.\nHis experience highlights some of the frustrations people have had using cryptocurrency where many of the customer safeguards which underpin standard online banking transactions, some mandated by law, do not apply.\n\"When they treat you like this, it makes you feel like you can't do anything,\" he told BBC News. \"Like you are powerless.\"\nWhile the cryptocurrency market is dominated by Bitcoin, there is a plethora of other digital currencies, including USDC - which Tzoni had already amassed in a separate crypto account.\nHis frustrations began in February when he decided to transfer some of his USDC coins to his Revolut account.\nAs a precaution - which Revolut suggests doing - he first sent 10 of the coins, worth $10. It was a success and the funds were credited to his Revolut account.\nDays later he tried to make a larger transfer of what he thought was 1,500 USDC. The transfer was completed but, this time, the funds were not credited to his account.\nTzoni says the problem occurred because Revolut's deposit instructions were unclear.\nWhen you transfer cryptocurrency from one account to another, you have to select a network to send it through - like choosing which courier service to use when sending a parcel.\nRevolut's deposit instructions say to transfer USDC to it, you have to use a network called Polygon. In his first, successful, deposit Tzoni selected one called \"Polygon PoS\".\nIn the second deposit, when he tried to transfer 1,500 USDC, he selected a different network - \"Polygon (bridged)\". \nHe thought it would work just as well but says instead it caused the coins to be converted into USDC.e - a different cryptocurrency. \nThis is what Revolut received. The company does not handle USDC.e coins.\nAfter seeing his Revolut account had not been credited with the 1,500 coins, Tzoni contacted the Revolut support team.\nIn messages seen by BBC News, they told him the issue seemed to be with \"the specific type of Polygon network used, which led to the conversion\".\nIn another, he was told: \"The app currently specifies 'Polygon' without differentiating between standard and bridged options. I'll note your feedback for future improvements.\"\nTzoni thinks if Revolut's deposit instructions had been more specific, his problem would have been avoided.\nWhen approached by BBC News about this case, Revolut gave a different answer.\nThe firm said the problem was not because Tzoni had used the wrong Polygon network - which he claimed turned his coins into USDC.e.\nThe deposit failure was \"not because the network itself had 'converted' the token\", it said, without explaining why its support team had suggested to Tzoni that it was.\nRevolut told us the deposit ultimately failed because the USDC.e coins it received were not supported by the company's technology.\nIt said: \"As is standard industry practice due to the significant technical challenges involved in supporting every combination of token and chain, the recovery of these unsupported assets does not sit within Revolut's scope.\"\nIt means the 1,500 USDC.e coins have not been credited to Tzoni's account or sent back to him.\nTo Tzoni's mind, this isn't acceptable treatment from a company of Revolut's size and reputation, which handles normal banking deposits as well as cryptocurrency, stocks and commodities.\nRevolut says it has 10 million users in the UK while last year it was granted a provisional banking licence, paving the way for it to become a fully fledged UK bank.\nWhen using a High Street bank, a mistaken transfer of traditional currency would usually be resolved with the money being reverted back to the customer.\nThis was established in 2014 in a voluntary code of practice that most UK banks signed up to. There is no such equivalent in the cryptocurrency industry.\nAfter contacting Revolut several times in recent weeks, Tzoni has been told the coins are effectively lost.\n\"They are waiting for me to get bored and give up, to accept the money is gone. But I won't,\" Tzoni said, pointing out the coins are in the Revolut system. \"It is ridiculous that they can behave like this.\"\nWhile Tzoni's loss of cryptocurrency is significant to him, the sum is tiny compared with the size of the industry, which has risen sharply in value over the past 18 months.\nThe global market peaked in value at $3.9tn last December, following the re-election of Donald Trump. Since then it has fallen by $1.1tn, according to tracking website CoinGecko.\nGovernment policies in the US and other countries are also changing to favour the cryptocurrency industry, even though it has suffered several scandals.\nFTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency firms, went bankrupt in 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried, its chief executive, was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year for defrauding customers of billions of dollars.\nInvestigators also found FTX was using QuickBooks, a popular accounting software designed for individuals and small businesses, to manage the money.\nJohn Ray III, a lawyer tasked with recovering funds from FTX for defrauded customers, told a bankruptcy court: \"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.\"\nHe later told a congressional hearing: \"Nothing against QuickBooks. It's a very nice tool, just not for a multibillion-dollar company.\"\nA couple of months ago Bybit, the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange by some estimates, was tricked out of $1.5bn worth of coins by hackers thought to be working for North Korea.\nThe firm had been using Safe, a free digital storage software popular with individuals who want to store cryptocurrency on their own devices, as part of their business operations.\nFollowing the theft, Bybit's chief executive said they \"should have upgraded and moved away from Safe\" earlier.\nOne of the problems with cryptocurrency firms, says Prof Mark Button, who researches cybercrime, is they can grow very quickly, which means they don't always keep up with the accounting and security challenges of managing so much money.\n\"For me it illustrates that if we are going to be serious about cryptocurrencies in the future\u2026 there needs to be some kind of regulation.\"\nIn Tzoni's case, it might have been easier for him to get his cryptocurrency back or be compensated if there were laws stating what firms need to do if they are sent a coin they don't handle.\nHigher industry standards might also have prevented him making such a transaction in the first place.\nMykhailo Tiutin is chief technology officer at AMLBot, a company that analyses how risky cryptocurrency transactions are.\nTheir service runs checks similar to those supported by banks, where details for a transfer, such as the account holder's name, sort code and account number, are verified.\nHe says cryptocurrency is safe enough for the average person to use but that they should be careful about which products and services they choose. He says he has also lost cryptocurrency after making an administrative mistake.\n\"You have to do your own research,\" he told us. \"The successes and the losses are ultimately at your own risk.\"",

        "article_text": "Pope Francis, who has died aged 88, made his final public appearance on Easter Sunday at the Vatican's St Peter's Square. \nAfter wishing the gathered crowd of more than 20,000 a happy Easter, he indicated that Archbishop Diego Ravelli, master of liturgical ceremonies, would read a message he had written.\nHere is the full text of his final public address, as released by the Vatican.\n\n\"Christ is risen, alleluia!\nDear brothers and sisters, Happy Easter!\nToday at last, the singing of the 'alleluia' is heard once more in the Church, passing from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart, and this makes the people of God throughout the world shed tears of joy.\nFrom the empty tomb in Jerusalem, we hear unexpected good news: Jesus, who was crucified, 'is not here, he has risen' (Lk 24:5). Jesus is not in the tomb, he is alive!\nLove has triumphed over hatred, light over darkness and truth over falsehood. Forgiveness has triumphed over revenge. Evil has not disappeared from history; it will remain until the end, but it no longer has the upper hand; it no longer has power over those who accept the grace of this day.\nSisters and brothers, especially those of you experiencing pain and sorrow, your silent cry has been heard and your tears have been counted; not one of them has been lost! \nIn the passion and death of Jesus, God has taken upon himself all the evil in this world and in his infinite mercy has defeated it. He has uprooted the diabolical pride that poisons the human heart and wreaks violence and corruption on every side. The Lamb of God is victorious! That is why, today, we can joyfully cry out: 'Christ, my hope, has risen!' (Easter Sequence). \nThe resurrection of Jesus is indeed the basis of our hope. For in the light of this event, hope is no longer an illusion. Thanks to Christ \u2014 crucified and risen from the dead \u2014 hope does not disappoint! Spes non confundit! (cf. Rom 5:5). That hope is not an evasion, but a challenge; it does not delude, but empowers us.\nAll those who put their hope in God place their feeble hands in his strong and mighty hand; they let themselves be raised up and set out on a journey. Together with the risen Jesus, they become pilgrims of hope, witnesses of the victory of love and of the disarmed power of Life.\nChrist is risen! These words capture the whole meaning of our existence, for we were not made for death but for life. Easter is the celebration of life! God created us for life and wants the human family to rise again! In his eyes, every life is precious! The life of a child in the mother's womb, as well as the lives of the elderly and the sick, who in more and more countries are looked upon as people to be discarded.\nWhat a great thirst for death, for killing, we witness each day in the many conflicts raging in different parts of our world! How much violence we see, often even within families, directed at women and children! How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalised, and migrants!\nOn this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!\nI would like us to renew our hope that peace is possible! From the Holy Sepulchre, the Church of the Resurrection, where this year Easter is being celebrated by Catholics and Orthodox on the same day, may the light of peace radiate throughout the Holy Land and the entire world.\nI express my closeness to the sufferings of Christians in Palestine and Israel, and to all the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. The growing climate of anti-Semitism throughout the world is worrisome. Yet at the same time, I think of the people of Gaza, and its Christian community in particular, where the terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.\nI appeal to the warring parties: call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace!\nLet us pray for the Christian communities in Lebanon and in Syria, presently experiencing a delicate transition in its history. They aspire to stability and to participation in the life of their respective nations. I urge the whole Church to keep the Christians of the beloved Middle East in its thoughts and prayers.\nI also think in particular of the people of Yemen, who are experiencing one of the world's most serious and prolonged humanitarian crises because of war, and I invite all to find solutions through a constructive dialogue.\nMay the risen Christ grant Ukraine, devastated by war, his Easter gift of peace, and encourage all parties involved to pursue efforts aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace.\nOn this festive day, let us remember the South Caucasus and pray that a final peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan will soon be signed and implemented, and lead to long-awaited reconciliation in the region.\nMay the light of Easter inspire efforts to promote harmony in the western Balkans and sustain political leaders in their efforts to allay tensions and crises, and, together with their partner countries in the region, to reject dangerous and destabilising actions.\nMay the risen Christ, our hope, grant peace and consolation to the African peoples who are victims of violence and conflict, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Sudan and South Sudan. May he sustain those suffering from the tensions in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region, as well as those Christians who in many places are not able freely to profess their faith.\nThere can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression and respect for the views of others.\nNor is peace possible without true disarmament! The requirement that every people provide for its own defence must not turn into a race to rearmament. \nThe light of Easter impels us to break down the barriers that create division and are fraught with grave political and economic consequences. It impels us to care for one another, to increase our mutual solidarity, and to work for the integral development of each human person.\nDuring this time, let us not fail to assist the people of Myanmar, plagued by long years of armed conflict, who, with courage and patience, are dealing with the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Sagaing, which caused the death of thousands and great suffering for the many survivors, including orphans and the elderly. We pray for the victims and their loved ones, and we heartily thank all the generous volunteers carrying out the relief operations. \nThe announcement of a ceasefire by various actors in the country is a sign of hope for the whole of Myanmar.\nI appeal to all those in positions of political responsibility in our world not to yield to the logic of fear which only leads to isolation from others, but rather to use the resources available to help the needy, to fight hunger and to encourage initiatives that promote development. These are the 'weapons' of peace: weapons that build the future, instead of sowing seeds of death!\nMay the principle of humanity never fail to be the hallmark of our daily actions. In the face of the cruelty of conflicts that involve defenceless civilians and attack schools, hospitals and humanitarian workers, we cannot allow ourselves to forget that it is not targets that are struck, but persons, each possessed of a soul and human dignity.\nIn this Jubilee year, may Easter also be a fitting occasion for the liberation of prisoners of war and political prisoners!\nDear brothers and sisters,\nIn the Lord's Paschal Mystery, death and life contended in a stupendous struggle, but the Lord now lives forever (cf. Easter Sequence). He fills us with the certainty that we too are called to share in the life that knows no end, when the clash of arms and the rumble of death will be heard no more. Let us entrust ourselves to him, for he alone can make all things new (cf. Rev. 21:5)!\nHappy Easter to everyone!\"",

        "article_text": "Leicester have been relegated from the Premier League after defeat to Liverpool \nThe banner flown over the King Power Stadium made its point. \n'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool.\nA second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwards as Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winner put the visitors within three points of the Premier League title.\nIt has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. \nThe drop had been coming - Leicester have won just once since December - and there was an air of resignation around the ground, even before Alexander-Arnold's strike. \nThere are unhappy and disconnected fans, players accused of giving up, and a manager in Ruud van Nistelrooy who, despite his pedigree as a player, has seen the Foxes get worse on his watch. \nThere were some boos at full-time, but the majority of home fans had already left. Those who stayed offered a smattering of applause, yet it was an empty gesture.\nIt reflected a club in need of a rebuild but how, and with who, are the biggest questions as Leicester - champions of England nine years ago - face one of their biggest crossroads.\nLeicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold moves Liverpool closer to title\n'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\n'My responsibility to lead the club in the best way' - Nistelrooy\nWhen the Foxes sacked Steve Cooper in October they were 16th, although the cracks were there.\nThe teething problems in moving away from Enzo Maresca's style - less expansive and working the ball quicker - were just part of the issue. \nThe departed Maresca, who led them to the Championship title last season before joining Chelsea, was well-liked by the squad and Cooper struggled to connect with players, even if some of the senior members of the squad - including Jamie Vardy - were onside. \nThere was growing concern from the club that any disconnect would impact their survival prospects, and one of the reasons why they dismissed Cooper. \nSo, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.\nFormer Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.\nYet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.\nThey have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.\nThe Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. \nThat is in stark contrast to the lack of goals under Van Nistelrooy - a revered striker for Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Netherlands - and they have scored just six times in the league since the draw with Brighton on 8 December.\nAnother goalless outing against Liverpool extended the home goal drought to nine league games and 810 minutes - the worst in top-flight history.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"They have some big decisions to make. It has been awful for them. They have been miles off it.\"\nSome players have recently raised concerns over the standard and intensity of training with the drop-off being connected to Leicester's impending relegation, which was becoming increasingly inevitable.\nThe fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks - Van Nistelrooy has dropped him for the last four games for refusing to agree to stay at the training ground one night a week - emphasises the growing tensions. \nWhen asked about whether he had been able to improve the standards and culture in his five months at the club, Van Nistelrooy was clear.\n\"When you don't combine them with results it's always hard. There's no negotiation on these standards and I hold everyone accountable on those,\" the Dutchman said this month. \n\"I know how I worked from a village of 5,000 people in the middle of nowhere to Manchester United and Real Madrid. I know what is necessary to stay at the highest level and I know there are so many people working at this football club who have the quality to do so. But not enough yet. \n\"In difficult moments you get to know people and characters very well. I speak about standards and what is needed to perform at the highest level and that's a culture which needs to be created in this club.\"\nDefender Conor Coady has been one trying to raise spirits at the club's Seagrave training base, but it has been an almost impossible task with results - and he admitted Leicester have not been good enough. \n\"We've took a bit of stick and we'll continue to take stick because it's deserved,\" said the former England centre-back. \"From minute one this season, we haven't been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it'll chew you up and spit you out.\"\nSusan Whelan, Jon Rudkin and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha watched Leicester's defeat to Liverpool\nAs the plane's banner suggested, director of football Jon Rudkin and the board have been the target for fans this season.\nThey see Rudkin as a root cause of their decline in recent seasons. He was, of course, in the same position when the Foxes stunned the world to win the Premier League in 2016, but supporters have made up their minds. \nIt does not help that the hierarchy rarely speak publicly, allowing supporters to understand and digest the situation.\nChief executive Susan Whelan twice met with the Foxes Trust and the club's Fan Advisory Board in February for candid and constructive meetings but the wider fanbase remain disconnected.\nDoes chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha decide to make a change at the top, does head of recruitment Martyn Glover's position come under more scrutiny following a number of poor transfer windows, regardless of financial constraints?\nVan Nistelrooy's position remains a doubt and it is hard to see a long-term future in the wake of damning statistics. \nDefeat against Liverpool leaves him with the unenviable record of having lost 17 of his 22 games, winning just three. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?\nVan Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.\n\"It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there.\n\"The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it. In a situation like this you have to sit very carefully with the club to discuss the matters.\"\nYet sacking a second manager of the season has financial consequences and with money tight, it will be a consideration. Can Leicester financially afford to sack Van Nistelrooy but, going forward, can they afford not to?\nThere is also an acceptance the squad needs a reset but only three players are out of contract - goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, and 38-year-old captain Jamie Vardy. \nWhat happens with Vardy - influential at the club as their last remaining title winner and the scorer of 198 goals - remains open, but it's the biggest decision the club has to make in terms of the squad given his reputation and achievements.\nIt means Leicester must shift big earners to make wholesale changes to a squad which has, in the main, brought them down twice.\nWilfred Ndidi signed a new three-year contract last summer but his appetite for another Championship campaign is likely to have waned and the same will go for defenders Ricardo Pereira and Wout Faes. Although, as part of Leicester's decline, they must find takers.\nGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been a rare bright spot and will have his admirers, as will Bilal El Khannouss, despite an underwhelming first season in England, while Winks' situation could depend on Van Nistelrooy's exit. \nLike every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.\nLeicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.\nYet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float.  \nFor now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with.\nThey made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. This time their short-term future is far less certain.",

'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool.A second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwards as Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winner put the visitors within three points of the Premier League title.It has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. So, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.Former Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.Yet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.They have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.The Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. Like every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.Leicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.Yet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?Van Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.",

Although the Australian was quicker in both the second and third sectors, the Dutchman had done enough to grab pole.\nVerstappen said: \"I definitely didn't expect to be on pole here but the car came alive in the night and it was a lot more enjoyable to drive. The grip was coming to me. Around here a qualifying lap is extremely difficult. It is really satisfying.\n\"Tomorrow in the race it will be tough to keep them behind but we are going to give it a good go.\"\nNorris did not want to speak about his crash in interviews after qualifying\nPiastri said: \"Max has done a good job, another high-speed circuit for them, where they seem to have a little more success. Our pace is good. It's going to be a tough race, the tyres are softer than last year and we'll see if that plays to our advantage.\"\nNorris will have to rely on the strong race pace of the McLaren to try to limit the damage to his championship position, as he starts the race three points clear of Piastri and eight in front of Verstappen.\nHis accident was caused by him misjudging the entry to the chicane at Turns Four and Five. The car oversteered on to the kerb at Five and was flicked into the wall on the exit, damaging the left-hand side of the car.\nHe swore over the radio that he was an \"idiot\", but was unhurt.\n\"Disappointed but I'm fine,\" Norris said. \"The team have a lot of work to do. It has been such a smooth positive weekend so far, so I'm disappointed to have such big setback. But have to take it on the chin, and try and go again tomorrow.\n\"The car is quick. It has been quick all weekend, so I have to work hard to overtake the cars tomorrow.\"\nRussell said he had \"mixed feelings\" because he felt there was more in his car, adding that he rued Mercedes' decision not to use the same strategy as Red Bull after the red flag.\nAt Ferrari, Hamilton's travails this season continued, underlined by the statistic that he has only once so far qualified higher than the seventh place he managed this weekend.\n\"I've been nowhere all weekend,\" Hamilton said. \"I am happier than I was yesterday. It really wasn't coming easy, so P7 is OK. I still have work to do to try to gel with this car.\"",

        "article_text": "From the latest season of the dystopian workplace drama to the UK miniseries that got the world talking and a new hit medical show, we pick the year's greatest programmes to stream right now.\nHollywood is an easy target, but this satire is so sharp, astute and sometimes absurd that it may be the funniest show of the year. Seth Rogen, who co-created the show, plays Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of Continental Studios, a lover of high-art films with a mandate to make commercial hits based on IP including Kool-Aid. A flood of actors and directors \u2013 including Ron Howard, Olivia Wilde and Zoe Kravitz \u2013 make cameo appearances, gleefully spoofing their own images, none funnier than Martin Scorsese in the hilarious opening episode. The series regulars are ideally cast, with Ike Barniholtz as Sal Saperstein, Matt's second-in-command, Catherine O'Hara as the previous studio head and Kathryn Hahn as the loud, wackily-dressed head of publicity. Taking us into the Golden Globes and marketing meetings, The Studio suggests that everyone is just bumbling along at a moment when the entire movie industry is in crisis. The industry might not know where it's going, but this behind-the-scenes comedy is a pure delight. (CJ)\nAvailable on Apple TV+ internationally\nOne thing's for sure: if Mike White's first-world-problems satire about rich holidaymakers was admired by many for its first two seasons, it broke out to become a true cultural phenomenon in its third, with a huge ratings boost. This time round, it sent its dysfunctional groupings \u2013 a corrupt financier and his family, three clashing female friends, a vengeful man and his younger girlfriend \u2013 to a Thai wellness retreat, and every week, you could not move online (metaphorically) for the discourse it generated and debate it stirred. Some complained that this season was too slow and lacked\u00a0suitable plot momentum, while others pointed out, sagely, that the problem was that it was a character-led drama that was never meant to be dissected like Game\u00a0of Thrones, but for its unexpected blockbuster popularity. Personally? I enjoyed it as both the darkest and most reflective series so far, but one which again thrived off a magisterially cast ensemble, in which Parker Posey, Carrie Coon, Aimee Lou Wood and Patrick Schwarzenegger were standouts, but no one was a weak link. (HM)\nAvailable on Max in the US and Now in the UK\u00a0\nIt's no wonder that this uncompromising British series about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl in his school has become a cultural flashpoint, praised by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, made available to be shown in schools and sparking conversations about young men and the toxic influence of social media. The social issue is wrapped in a drama brilliantly personalized and brought to life by the actors. Stephen Graham, who created the show with Jack Thorne, plays the boy's father and conveys the shock and grief of a parent forced to consider the unthinkable possibility that his son might be a killer. Owen Cooper gives a remarkably sophisticated performance as the accused boy, who seems guileless until he explodes in anger. And Ashley Waters plays a detective who struggles to understand his own teenage son, expanding the theme beyond one family. Each episode was shot in a single, real-time take, which sounds like a gimmick, but director Philip Barantini handles that approach so smoothly that it fades into the background, even while adding intensity to a piercing drama that offers no comfortable resolution. (CJ)\nAvailable on Netflix internationally\nFairly or not, Apple TV+ has become a streamer known for ploughing huge resources (\nover $20bn, reportedly) into a range of starry shows that not very many people watch \u2013 but with the second series of this dystopian workplace drama, it became clear it had a genuine watercooler hit on its hands. Which is even more surprising, when you consider just how strange Severance is. Its compelling high-concept premise \u2013 in which employees of the sinister Lumon corporation have their consciousness separated into office selves, or \"innies\", and home selves, or \"outies\" \u2013 is one thing, but beyond that, it is constantly taking the story down surreal rabbit holes, involving for example, mysterious \"macrodata refinement\" work or a herd of goats. In truth, as this series progressed through its second half, it felt a little too meandering for its own good, and its climactic payoff couldn't match that from the first season. But it's still an exquisite work in all areas, from the clever dual-identity acting (especially from shining star Britt Lower) to the stark visuals. Bring on season three, and perhaps a few more solid answers as to what's \nreally\n going on at Lumon. (HM)\nAvailable on Apple TV+ internationally\nIt might sound like just another medical drama, but this show about a trauma centre in Pittsburgh revitalises the genre with its attention to the psychological stress on caregivers. Noah Wyle gives a shattering performance as the department head, the dedicated, harried, emotionally wracked Dr Robbie, still traumatised after failing to save his mentor during the Covid-19 pandemic. He is surrounded by other doctors and a group of students and interns, each adding a different dimension, from Supriya Ganesh as a brilliant medical prodigy to Isa Briones as an abrasive intern and Taylor Dearden as the caring Dr Mel, whose neurodivergence makes her especially empathetic with her patients. Unlike most medical shows, The Pitt never lets their personal melodrama overwhelm the focus on their work. Each absorbing, fast-paced episode takes place in real time during one 15-hour-long shift, and each veers between the devastation of losing patients and the relief of saving them. You'd think a series so blunt about death would be depressing, but instead The Pitt is exhilarating in its focus on people for whom life and death are everyday events. (CJ)\nAvailable on Max in the US\nIt's difficult to discuss the power of this show without giving away the key twist that comes at the end of episode one. But safe to say, it turns what starts as a relatively conventional political thriller on its head. Sterling K Brown is the head of the US president's security detail, who finds himself accused of murder of his boss \u2013 but above and beyond the killing itself, not everything seems quite right with the world. Created by Dan Fogelman, the man behind the equally rug-pulling TV weepie This is Us, this is solid entertainment in the very best sense, with sharp plotting matched by some strong performances, from Brown\u2019s tortured hero to Julianne Nicholson as a sinister tech billionaire. Plus, later on in the series, one particular episode which deals with truly monumental matters is simply breathtaking \u2013 but again, that's all that can be said without spoiling things for those yet to watch. The good news for those that have is that it's already been recommissioned. (HM)\nAvailable on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally\u00a0\nThe sumptuous conclusion to this adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall trilogy blends a beautifully shot escape into the luxurious past of Henry VIII's court with an evergreen depiction of the high personal cost of manoeuvring for power and influence. Mark Rylance is poignant as the king's advisor, Thomas Cromwell, who questions his own decisions, while the mercurial Henry is losing confidence in him. And Damian Lewis's fresh interpretation of Henry is dazzling, his voice and manner chillingly subdued even as he issues the most ruthless commands. Henry's wives come and go, but the unravelling bond between these men, and their opposite trajectories \u2013 Cromwell's self-doubts and decline and Henry's iron will that eliminates anyone in his way \u2013 shape the story. Written by Peter Straughn, a recent Oscar winner for his screenplay of Conclave, The Mirror and the Light is more resonant today than the original Mantel book was when it was published in 2020. It feels entirely relevant in a world where creeping authoritarianism is a global concern. (CJ)\nAvailable on PBS in the US and BBC iPlayer in the UK\nSince breaking out in HBO teen drama Euphoria, rising star Jacob Elordi has chosen his roles well \u2013 but perhaps nothing has served him better so far than returning to his home country of Australia to play the protagonist in this searing war drama. An adaptation of Richard Flanagan's Booker Prize-winning novel, it explores the life of World War Two army surgeon Dorrigo Evans across three time periods: his stint stationed in Adelaide for military training, his hellish experiences as a prisoner of war in the Thai jungle, and then his existence as a professionally successful but emotionally deeply troubled veteran (now played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), still unable to truly process the events of decades ago. Brought to impactful visual life by Justin Kurzel, known for his visceral studies of male violence on the big screen like Snowtown and The Order, it is simply one of the best evocations of the horrors of conflict that has been committed to screen. But at the same time, it takes as much care in its exploration of passion as violence, with the chemistry between Elordi's young Dorrigo and his uncle's wife Amy (a superb Odessa Young) burning up the screen. Given some of the scenes of sadistic brutality, it is of course a difficult watch, as it should be, but also one whose sheer artistry offers a kind of transcendence. (HM)\u00a0\nAvailable on Prime Video in the US, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada\nJon Hamm has never been better, expertly mixing comedy and drama in this series about a hedge-fund manager called Coop, who loses his job. He schemes to keep up appearances in his wealthy community, only to discover a new sense of himself. The show has a broad comic element, as Coop turns cat burglar, solving his financial problems by stealing luxury items from his neighbours. But the series is best in its bold take on what he calls in one of his mordant voiceovers, \"the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men\", and in its depiction of his complicated relationships. He is still emotionally attached to his ex-wife (Amanda Peet), who left him for one of his friends, and struggles to connect with his two teenage children. He has a tender, supportive bond with his emotionally fragile sister (Lena Hall, a standout in the cast). Hamm hasn't had a role this rich since Don Draper in Mad Men, another flawed but sympathetic charmer who makes some wildly bad decisions, and defines the character so perfectly that it's hard to imagine anyone else at the centre of this sleek but penetrating series. (CJ)\nAvailable on AppleTV+ internationally\nIt might have created a little less noise than Adolescence, but here is another British show about masculinity that really deserves to be seen. Jack Rooke's semi-autobiographical show about two university students who form an odd-couple friendship \u2013 nerdy gay man Jack and straight jack-the-lad Dan \u2013 has been an incredibly deft mix of laugh-out-loud humour, complete with delightfully niche pop culture references, and poignant drama \u2013 covering sexual awakening, depression, dementia and more besides \u2013 since it started in 2022. But this third and final series was undoubtedly its most powerful, kicking off with a hilarious episode on a package holiday in Greece but getting more serious as it continued, and handling Danny's spiralling mental health problems with particular skill. And boy, does Rooke know how to shatter audience hearts \u2013 the final episode is an emotional masterclass, including a significant cameo from the man himself. Here's hoping that it launches its extremely talented creator into the big time.

I was just sliding around. It's pretty bad.\"\nHe is seventh in the drivers' championship with his best result in a full grand prix this season his fifth place in Bahrain a week ago.\nHamilton said that he was \"struggling to feel the car beneath me\" but that there was \"no particular thing, nothing to say: 'Hey, this is the issue.'\"\nAnd asked why he had been so good in the sprint race in China last month, where he won from pole position, and had struggled elsewhere, he said: \"I don't have an answer.\"\nBriton Hamilton, 40, said he expected to struggle at the next race in Miami, too, adding: \"I don't know how much longer I'll struggle for but it's definitely painful. Just going to try and improve from week to week.\"\n\"At the moment there is no fix so this is how it's going to be for the rest or the year. It's going to be painful.\n\"In qualifying it's me extracting performance and in the race I tried everything and the car just didn't want to go any quicker.\"\nVerstappen would not discuss penalty because 'people can't handle the full truth'\nPiastri wins in Saudi Arabia and takes title lead\nLeclerc, by contrast, drove an outstanding race with a long first stint on the medium tyres to catch and pass Mercedes' George Russell for the final podium place.\nHe said: \"I feel like we've maximised absolutely everything we could have this weekend. There wasn't anything more in the car.\n\"We need to focus on qualifying because it's been a very long time I haven't been as happy with the car balance.\n\"I feel very at ease with the car in a way that I know I can extract the maximum out of the car more often than not, but unfortunately, the car potential is just not good enough to fight for better in qualifying.\"\nFerrari just missed out on winning the constructors' championship last year and started this season hoping to compete for the title.\nBut McLaren and Red Bull have progressed more than the Italian team over the winter.\nLeclerc said: \"We are close on the race pace. Free air dictates a little bit who is going to win the race. That's always been the case. Maybe this year a little bit more than other years. And obviously when that is the case, qualifying is more important.\n\"But unfortunately, for two years, we are just struggling in qualifying to put everything together.\n\"The problem is it's not always the same issue. This time it was four tenths in the first three corners. For the rest of the lap, we were fast. And now today in the race, actually, the first sector was probably the best sector we had.\n\"So we've got to look at that. Obviously, there are answers in what we are doing, and we are doing something wrong, clearly. We've got to find it.\n\"We cannot lose too many races before finding it because we're already 50 points down in the drivers' championship.\n\"We're not looking at it too much, but 50 points is a big number. I don't want to be losing more points than that in the next few races.\"\nIt was Charles Leclerc's first time reaching the podium this season \nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions",

        "article_text": "A suspect accused of killing two people and injuring six others during a shooting spree at Florida State University did not know his victims, police said Friday. \nThe alleged gunman, 20-year-old FSU student Phoenix Ikner, began shooting around lunchtime on Thursday near the student union building in Tallahassee. The motive remains unclear.\nPolice said the gun was owned by his stepmother, Jessica Ikner, a veteran police officer. \nIn a video statement, Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell said: \"At this point, there does not appear to be any connection at all between the shooter and any of the victims.\"\nDetails about the victims began to emerge Friday. One of two people killed was an employee of food service provider Aramark, the company said on Friday. \nTiru Chabba, 45, of Greenville, South Carolina, was a married father of two, according to a statement from a law firm hired by his family. He was on the Florida campus working Thursday when the shooting began.\n\"We are heartbroken to confirm that an Aramark employee was among those killed at FSU yesterday in that senseless act of violence,\" the company, which manages Florida State University's on-campus dining programmes, said in a statement. \"We are absolutely shaken by the news and our deepest sympathies are with the family and our entire Aramark community.\"\nThe other dead victim, university dining worker Robert Morales, was identified by his sister, who posted a tribute online. His LinkedIn profile said he had been working at FSU as a university dining co-ordinator since 2015.\nAt a news conference on Friday, doctors at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare hospital said six people injured by gunshots were in stable condition, with one seriously injured. \nDoctors said two of the victims would be released from hospital on Friday, and all were expected to make full recoveries. \nAccording to a police timeline, officers responded to an active shooter call shortly before midday local time on Thursday. An alert was issued warning students and those on campus to \"seek shelter and await further instructions\".\n\"One of my classmates got an alert on her phone and announced it to the rest of the class,\" student Ava Arenado told CBS News Miami.\nAnother student, Blake Leonard, told CBS he initially heard roughly 12 shots fired.\n\"In my head, I thought it was construction at first, until I looked behind me and saw people running from the union towards my direction, and then I heard another 12 or 15 shots go off, so I started running away from there too,\" he said.\nThe incident ended less than five minutes later when police shot Mr Ikner after he did not comply with their commands, authorities said. He was undergoing treatment at a local hospital, police said.\nChief Revell said Mr Ikner had serious injuries and would be in hospital for a \"significant time\", after which he will face charges \"up to and including first-degree murder\". \nLeon County Sheriff Walt McNeil described the suspect's stepmother Mrs Ikner, who worked as a school resource officer, as a \"model employee\".\nHe said the gun used in the shooting was a police-issued firearm that Mrs Ikner kept for personal use after the force upgraded its weapons. A shotgun also was found at the scene, police said.\nThe suspect was a \"longstanding member\" of the sheriff office's youth advisory council and was engaged in a number of training programmes, Sheriff McNeil said.\n\"So it is not a surprise that he had access to weapons,\" he said.\nCourt documents indicate that the alleged gunman was largely raised by his father and stepmother.\nHe was previously known as Christian Eriksen and was the subject of a long-running custody dispute between his biological mother and father. He had health issues including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and a growth disorder, according to court documents.\nThe FSU student newspaper quoted the suspect commenting on an anti-Trump rally on campus in January.\nFSUNews.com said Mr Ikner, who was registered to vote as a Republican, commented about anti-Trump protesters: \"These people are usually pretty entertaining, usually not for good reasons.\"\nPresident Donald Trump, who said he was briefed on the incident, called the shooting \"a shame, a horrible thing\".\nWhen asked by reporters whether he wanted to change gun regulations in light of the shooting, he said he was a \"big advocate\" of the Second Amendment in the US Constitution, which protects gun rights.\n\"I have been since the beginning,\" he said. \"I have protected it. These things are terrible. We will have more to say about it later.\"",

        "article_text": "For the last few weeks, many foreign students living in the US have watched as a sequence of events has repeated itself on their social media feeds: plain-clothes agents appearing unannounced and hauling students off in unmarked cars to detention centres.\nThose taken into custody in a string of high-profile student detentions captured on video have not faced any criminal charges and instead appear to have been targeted for involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. \nThe Trump administration has said repeatedly that visas are a \"privilege\" and can be revoked at any time for a wide variety of reasons.\nBut the crackdown appears to be far wider than initially thought, with more than 1,000 international students or recent graduates at colleges across the US now having had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, according to a tracker from Inside Higher Ed, an online news site covering the sector.\nFor many, the precise reasons are unknown, and universities have often only learned of the changes when checking a government-run database that logs the visa status of international students.\nThe combination of targeted detentions and reports of wide-scale visa revocations have left campuses on edge, from the biggest public universities to elite Ivy League institutions, students and faculty told the BBC.\n\"I could be next,\" said one student visa-holder attending Georgetown University, who has written articles about Israel and the war in Gaza.\nHe's begun carrying around a card in his pocket that lists his constitutional rights, in case he is ever stopped by law enforcement.\nAnother student in Texas said he's afraid to leave his apartment, even to buy groceries.\nAnd at some colleges, departments are being hit as researchers abroad refuse to return to the US.\nMost students the BBC spoke to requested anonymity out of fear that having their names in the media could make them a target.\nThe BBC has contacted the Department of Education for comment.\nThe reasons for visa cancellations vary. In some cases, criminal records appear to be a factor. Other instances have reportedly included minor legal infractions like driving over the speed limit. But \"a lot\" of those targeted have been involved in pro-Palestinian protests, Secretary of State Marco Rubio himself has said.\nIt is part of a wider White House push to crack down on protesters whom officials say created an unsafe environment for Jewish students on many campuses. They also accuse demonstrators of having expressed support for Hamas, an officially designated terrorist group. \n\"Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,\" Rubio told reporters in late March. \"We do it every day.\"\nCivil liberties groups have protested against the detentions and moves to deport student demonstrators as a violation of constitutional rights. And the students themselves reject associations with Hamas, saying that they are being targeted for political speech about the war in Gaza and US support for Israel.\nAt Georgetown, signs that read \"protect our students\" have been taped to the doors of bathroom stalls, adding a sense of gloom to the cherry blossom trees and tulips that typically mark the arrival of spring on campus.\nA postdoctoral fellow from the university, Badar Khan Suri, was grabbed by federal agents outside his Virginia home in March. The Department of Homeland Security  accused the conflict resolution researcher of \"promoting antisemitism on social media\" and having links to a \"known or suspected terrorist\". \nThis was an apparent reference to the Palestinian father of his US-born wife, a former adviser to killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\nMr Suri's lawyers say he has only met his father-in-law a handful of times and is being targeted due to his wife's identity.\nHis detention followed that of Columbia University student protest organiser Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident arrested at home in New York but now awaiting deportation from a facility in Louisiana.\nTufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who co-authored a student newspaper op-ed about Gaza and was detained in Massachusetts, is also being held in Louisiana.\nLast Monday, Mohsen Mahdawi, another Columbia student protester, was detained in Vermont as he attended an interview to obtain US citizenship. Like Mr Khalil, he holds a green card, rather than a student visa.\n\"Based on the detentions that we're seeing, I think there is a possibility anyone who has been outspoken about Palestine can be detained,\" said the Georgetown student, who knew Mr Suri.\nThe White House says it is going after those who have been involved in activities that \"run counter\" to US national interests. In Mr Khalil's case, officials have cited a 1952 law that empowers the government to order someone deported if their presence in the country could pose unfavourable consequences for US foreign policy.\nIn a post on X, the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, calling him the \"ringleader of chaos\" at the university. \nPolling suggests that immigration is an issue where President Trump enjoys some of his highest approval ratings, with recent Reuters and AP-NORC surveys suggesting about half of US adults approve of action in that area, several points higher than his overall rating.\nUniversities are also being targeted at an institutional level. This week, the White House's task force on combating antisemitism froze over $2bn in funding for Harvard University, after the university refused to agree to a list of demands that it said would amount to \"surrendering its independence\".\nTrump officials have said that if Harvard doesn't comply with a request for information on certain student visaholders, it will stop granting visas to international students who want to study there.\nGeorgetown professor Nader Hashemi said he believes the government's main goal is \"silencing dissent\" by intimidating would-be protesters.\nThe Georgetown student says he has asked his parents not to fly from India to the US to see him graduate with a master's degree in just a few weeks. He is still unsure if he will even attend the ceremony.\nIn addition to checking his email daily to see if he is among the hundreds that have had their visas revoked recently, he has also prepared for the possibility of sudden arrest.\n\"I have cleared my chats across messaging apps, and I have learned how to quickly lock my phone in SOS mode,\" he said.\nGeorgetown professors have even begun offering spare rooms to students who worry about being visited by immigration agents at their residences, said Prof Hashemi.\n\"This is part of the trauma that I think students are facing,\" he said.\nAt Tufts University, outside of Boston, Massachusetts, students are waiting to see what happens to Ms Ozturk, who was detained outside her home.\nVideo shows her confused and shaking in fear as she is intercepted by agents while headed to a Ramadan dinner celebration. Last year, she had co-authored an op-ed supporting the boycott, divest and sanction (BDS) movement against Israel.\nTufts PhD student Anteri Mejr told the BBC that the actions have had a \"chilling effect\", and that international students she knows who have left the country to visit home or attend conferences are now afraid to return.\n\"There are students working remotely because they're afraid they can't get back in the country,\" he said.\nAt the University of Texas, rumours about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids on campus have some students terrified.\n\"I'm scared to be out. I'm scared to come to school. I'm scared to go grocery shopping,\" a master's student there said.\n\"I'm afraid that if I'm walking, I will be approached by agents in incognito clothes and plain disguise,\" he continued.\nDespite being a green card holder and having not played a role in pro-Palestinian protests on campus, he says he is still in \"crippling anxiety\" because he has written things that are critical of the president.\n\"How far does this administration dig through, like, an immigrant's history?\" he asked. \"What if I did say something and I'm not aware.\"",

Anxiety at US colleges as foreign students are detained and visas revoked3 days agoShareSaveBrandon Drenon and Robin Levinson-KingBBC News, Washington DC and BostonShareSaveBBCFor the last few weeks, many foreign students living in the US have watched as a sequence of events has repeated itself on their social media feeds: plain-clothes agents appearing unannounced and hauling students off in unmarked cars to detention centres.Those taken into custody in a string of high-profile student detentions captured on video have not faced any criminal charges and instead appear to have been targeted for involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. The Trump administration has said repeatedly that visas are a \"privilege\" and can be revoked at any time for a wide variety of reasons.But the crackdown appears to be far wider than initially thought, with more than 1,000 international students or recent graduates at colleges across the US now having had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, according to a tracker from Inside Higher Ed, an online news site covering the sector.For many, the precise reasons are unknown, and universities have often only learned of the changes when checking a government-run database that logs the visa status of international students.The combination of targeted detentions and reports of wide-scale visa revocations have left campuses on edge, from the biggest public universities to elite Ivy League institutions, students and faculty told the BBC.",

But today I think of him as my player. When he is ready he is facing the competition in the team because he is ready to play.\n\"You don't know. Amass did really well today. Chido when he played, did quite well. It is a difficult moment and not the right moment for the kids to play. But if we have to do it, we will.\"\nIt is not known yet whether senior defenders Noussair Mazraoui or Victor Lindelof will be involved against Wolves.\nMazraoui was taken off at half-time and Lindelof had a planned substitute appearance scrapped after they were alerted independently to medical issues at home.\n\"It was the same for both,\" he said. \n\"Sometimes you don't control these things but everything is OK now. I know football is really important but there are things that are more important. They will be ready to play the next game.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "Boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Girl fends off love rivals and boy - finally - declares his affection for her.\nIf you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor.\nBut in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention. \nContent creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.\nLatey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette). \nTen women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas. \nThroughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.\nBroadcast on YouTube, Lately is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.\nWinning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".\nOf course, not everyone feels the same way. \n\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.\n\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"\nMr Semere, aged 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.\nSeveral viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"\nAnother asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"\nMs Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.\n\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.\n\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"\nArguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.\nIn one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.\nVivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years. \n\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.\nElsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.\nBy baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.\nMs Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.\n\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.\n\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"\nShe says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\" \nAdapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"\nA second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"\nOff the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.\nThis time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.\n\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.\nAs for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.\n\"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says.\nBut Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\".\nShe is proud that Latey showcased \"the romantic side of Ethiopia\" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media.\n\"It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,\" she says.\n\"It is a new way of seeing.\"\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump and Giorgia Meloni talked up the chances of a trade deal between the US and Europe, as the Italian prime minister visited Washington.\n\"There will be a trade deal, 100%,\" Trump said, \"but it will be a fair deal\", while Meloni said she was \"sure\" they could reach an agreement, later adding that her aim was to \"make the West great again\".\nMeloni is the first European leader to visit Washington since Trump imposed, then paused, 20% tariffs on imports from the bloc.\nThe US president separately said on Thursday that he is confident of making \"a very good deal\" with China, adding that representatives from Beijing have reached out \"a number of times\". \nTrump and Meloni enjoy a good relationship and the Italian leader hopes to position herself as a bridge between the EU and the US amid fractured relations and mounting concerns about the global impact of Trump's tariffs.\nDespite his confidence in an eventual deal, Trump said he was in \"no rush\".\n\"Everybody wants to make a deal. And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them,\" he said, adding that he expects to cut deals with every country \"over the next three to four weeks\".\nTrump also suggested thathe was reluctant to further raise tariffs on China - which currently stand at 145%. \n\"I may not want to go higher. I may want to go to less because you know, you want people to buy and, at a certain point, people aren't gonna buy,\" he told reporters at the White House.\nAt a press conference on Thursday following Trump's and Meloni's conversation, the leaders said they had discussed defence spending, immigration and tariffs.\nThe atmosphere in the Oval Office appeared relaxed and good-natured - similar to the reception UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received during his visit to the White House in February.\nHowever Meloni's aides had described the visit as a \"commercial peace mission\" following Trump's decision to impose a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US. \nHe has strongly criticised the European Union on trade, claiming it was \"formed to screw the United States\". A 20% \"retaliatory\" tariff on the EU has been temporarily suspended until July.\nMeloni previously called the tariffs \"absolutely wrong\" and said they would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".\nWhile she didn't score any tangible wins on tariffs during the meeting, she did convince Trump to accept an invitation to visit Rome, which she said would be an occasion for him to meet other European leaders.\nGiven the fraught relations between the EU and the US, Meloni will likely chalk that up as a significant win, particularly if Trump agrees to meet the president of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, during the visit.\nMeloni will return to Europe with stronger credentials as the so-called \"Trump whisperer\", something that will be reinforced when she meets US Vice President JD Vance in Rome tomorrow.\nThe Italian leader was careful to praise Trump and align herself with the US president's viewpoints.\nIn her statement following the meeting, she criticised \"woke ideology\" and championed the \"war against illegal migration\".\n\"The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together,\" she added.\nShe also seized the opportunity to tout the work of her own government. \"I'm proud of sitting here as prime minister of an Italy that today has a very good situation - a stable country, a reliable country,\" Meloni said. \nShe noted that her government had brought inflation down and improved employment, before gesturing towards Trump and adding with a broad smile: \"Forgive me if I promote my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me\". Trump grinned back.\nMeloni basked in the praise lavished on her by Trump - from compliments about her work as prime minister to gushing about her Italian sounding \"beautiful\".\nThe US president praised Meloni for taking a tough stance on immigration and said he wished more people were like her. Meloni said that change was happening, thanks to the example set by Italy, referring to yesterday's EU announcement on safe countries.\nIt was only occasionally that she showed a tinge of irritation when asked about Italy's low defence spending.\nMeloni said that she expects Italy to announce at the next Nato meeting in June that her country would be able to meet the alliance's requirement that each member nation spends 2% of GDP on defence.\nDefence spending has been a key sticking point for Trump, with the US leader repeatedly demanding that Nato allies increase spending. \nItaly is one of eight countries that currently does not meet the 2% threshold, spending 1.49% on defence.\nItalian opposition leader Carlo Calenda said there had been \"two very positive outcomes\" from the visit: that Meloni \"stayed on track on Ukraine and managed to convince Trump to meet EU figures in Italy\".\nCalenda said Meloni had \"gained credibility as a bridge between the US and the EU\" but criticised her praise of \"Trump's fight on woke culture\".",

        "article_text": "Jen Troth has always wanted to be a mum, but a medical professional telling her she should not have children because of her sight loss has made the prospect \"terrifying\".\nThe 29-year-old social media influencer, who lives in Cardiff, has the hereditary condition retinitis pigmentosa and only has about 10% of her sight left.\nShe said there needed to be better awareness that disabled people \"exist in public life\".\nMeanwhile, other women with sight loss have said their children had become \"confident and caring\" people as a result of their experiences.\nThe Welsh government said it provided funding \"to help people with sight loss live confidently and safely\".\nMs Troth said she experienced \"generational trauma\" due to her father and grandmother having the same condition.\nHer dad Peter, 74, \"was basically told he was unemployable\" as a mechanic when he began to lose his sight, forcing him to move to Dubai to start his own business.\n\"Because of this, I was raised not to talk about my blindness and I didn't tell anyone until I was 24,\" she said. \n\"I was afraid to tell employers, to tell friends.\"\nShe said safety considerations faced by many women were heightened by sight loss, particularly regarding relationships.\nMs Troth added: \"You just have to trust that people in your life are going to be good people when, in a lot of cases, they're probably not.\n\"I had a previous partner lock me in a room once, to try and 'scare the blindness out of me' and prove I wasn't blind.\"\nShe said these issues extended to medical professionals and she was \"consistently\" told by an eye care consultant that she \"should not have children\".\n\"I have always wanted to be a mum.

How am I going to be allowed to look after a baby by myself?

This doesn't stop parenting from being a hugely rewarding and exciting experience,\" she said.\n\"RNIB Cymru is calling for everyone to support mothers with sight loss by making information accessible and dispelling harmful myths.\"\nThe Welsh government said the Wales Low Vision Service, provided by optometry practices, was the only service of its kind in the UK and provided more than 8,000 appointments for people with sight loss, of which almost 5,500 were women, in 2023-24.\n\"We fund a number of organisations to help people with sight loss live confidently and safely, and work with the Wales Vision Forum to improve access to services,\" it added.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer.\nThe controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages.\n\"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\"\nWhite House officials have played down reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it.\nTrump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary.\n\"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media,\" he said. \"Try finding something new,\" he said. \nTrump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea  also floated by Hegseth earlier on Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".\nHegseth did not directly respond to reports of a second Signal chat, which were initially covered by the New York Times.\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.\nThe messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times. But it too appeared to share details of military operations against Yemen.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nAlthough the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents. Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices.\nThe second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth criticised the media and denounced the reports. He also said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\".\nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, the top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said the \"Trump-hating media\" was  \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nUS air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.",

Relieved? There was no toolbox, I had no-one to talk to about how I was meant to feel \u2013 so I just felt angry.\n\"Angry with myself for maybe not pushing more \u2013 angry with the NHS for taking one look at me and dismissing me because of my age, my demographic.\"\nThe actor's symptoms had developed over a number of months in 2021, and when she returned from three months filming in Spain she spoke to her GP about back pain and bloating. \nShe was referred for a scan, which revealed a four inch (10cm) tumour on her right ovary.\nAfter further investigations, she said a multi-disciplinary team at the hospital in Nottingham talked her through the results.\n\"They said because of my age, and the sort of cells that were inside my tumour, times that by X, multiply this by Y and Z - you don't have cancer,\" she said. \n\nShalisha was told there was a six-month wait for surgery to remove the tumour.\nShe returned to the set of Casualty, relieved not to have cancer, but still with a distended stomach and \"excruciating pain\".\n\"Bless the costume department - I couldn't really tell anyone, so I asked if they could just make my scrubs a bit bigger, because I couldn't have people thinking I was pregnant,\" she said. \nNot even Shalisha's family knew cancer was a possibility, as she did not want to scare them without knowing the full facts.\n\"It was a very lonely experience because it was just me and my husband going through this,\" she said. \nThings came to a head in the spring of 2022.\n\"One morning in early March I woke the whole house up screaming - my tumour was twisting inside my abdomen,\" Shalisha said. \n\"I couldn't keep painkillers down so we had to call an ambulance.\"\nFollowing surgery, doctors discovered the 12 inch by 12 inch (30cm x 30cm) tumour was mucinous ovarian cancer.\n\"I didn't let anyone apart from my husband and my best friend come and visit me in hospital, because I didn't want to see in my mum's eyes how sick I looked,\" Shalisha said. \nShe said processing her diagnosis also came with challenges, adding: \"The pamphlets and websites never showed anyone younger than 40, let alone a black woman.\"\nShe credits the nurses volunteering with charity Black Women Rising with saving her life.\n\"There were times where I was at a point that if I didn't speak to someone right then, I was going to lose my mind and spiral \u2013 and I didn't know how to climb out of that,\" Shalisha said. \n\"But even within that community, I still haven't met a young woman with mucinous ovarian cancer who is of my Caribbean heritage.\n\"There's a lot of culture there \u2013 a rich history that is instilled into me \u2013 of having my own back and being strong, and I needed another woman to be like 'girl, I get it, I understand'.\"\nShalisha also praised the after-care she received from the oncology team in Cardiff, but said her cancer had changed \"every single facet of life\" including her attitude to her own body.\nWhen she awoke from surgery she had around 29 staples down her stomach.\n\"It took me a long time to look in the mirror, and a while before I started to see how incredible it is and what it represents,\" she said. \n\"Every time I get changed I'm reminded of what my body went through \u2013 but three years on I'm so proud of this tiny body that has got me to where I am now.\"\nSince leaving Casualty in 2024 Shalisha has taken on a number of theatre roles, presented Saying Yes to Life for BBC Radio wales, and also worked with charities to raise awareness of ovarian cancer, even though talking about it can still be difficult.\n\"People assume because I'm an actor I'm good at talking - but in work people write lines for me,\" she added.\n\"Speaking about my experience is completely new to me.\"\n\"Mucinous ovarian cancer is a rare form of cancer and the complexities of a case can make it challenging to diagnose,\" said Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust's director of nursing and professions Rachel Boardman.\n\"However, where there are concerns, various tests and scans are used to identify the cancer, which would be assessed at a multidisciplinary level, in order to maintain an accurate diagnosis and a treatment plan to be delivered as quickly as possible.\"\nAsk Eve nurse Helen Hyndman said: \"I speak to many young women who get in touch with Ask Eve for advice who struggled to get their diagnosis of one of the five gynaecological cancers.\n\"Women tell me that they felt that because of their age, they were seen as 'too young' for cancer to be investigated.\"\nThere are five gynaecological cancers - womb, ovarian, cervical, vulval and vaginal.\nMs Hyndman said: \"The symptoms of the five cancers include abnormal vaginal bleeding, unexplained pelvic pain, changes to bladder or bowel habits or vulva itching, all of which can be caused by other much more common and less serious conditions. \n\"This means it's usually appropriate to test for other conditions before checking for cancer in younger women and people with gynae organs. \n\"But if you can't find a cause, or your symptoms persist or worsen, don't be afraid to mention the word cancer to your doctor and ask for tests.\"",

        "article_text": "It may be set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but Tony Gilroy's Star Wars series takes a key plot from a real robbery masterminded by Stalin in an Imperial Russian city. And Andor has as much to do with our world as it has with Stalin's.\nIt has all the makings of the perfect heist.\nThe scheme takes place far from the imperial seat of power, on the wild fringes of an empire almost too vast to comprehend. Fuelled with revolutionary zeal, the plotters are a rag-tag outfit of men and women that includes thieves, murderers and turncoats. Their prize? A treasure chest of cash that can fund ever-more-ambitious missions against the hated ruling elite.\nIf you watched the first season of the Star Wars spin-off TV series Andor, you'll recognise this plot as one of the high points. Over three episodes, anti-hero Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and his band of accomplices hide out in mountain passes on the planet Aldhani, fine-tuning an audacious smash-and-grab from an Imperial garrison which is storing the wages of an entire sector.\u00a0\nThe real-life theft that inspired it was also a long, long time ago, just not quite so far away.\nIt took place in Yerevan Square in what was then the imperial Russian city of Tiflis, now the Georgian capital Tblisi, on 26 June 1907. A shipment of cash for the city's Russian state bank branch, amounting to some 300,000 roubles ($1m at the time), was stolen by a gang of robbers linked to the Bolshevik revolutionary movement. Using bombs and guns, the gang left a scene of utter devastation in their wake; some 40 people were killed and dozens more injured. The news of the brazen daylight attack made headlines across the world.\nThe heist was the brainchild of a charismatic cobbler's son-turned-revolutionary called Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili. He was a gifted public speaker, an ex-seminary student, a romantic poet rumoured to have left a string of broken hearts in his rakish wake. He often went by the name \"Soso\" (which he had used when writing poems for local publications), though in years to come he would become far better-known \u2013 and feared \u2013 as Joseph Stalin.\u00a0\nYes, the troubled outlaw beloved by Star Wars fans everywhere is based in part on one of history\u2019s most notorious mass murderers, as the series' creator, Tony Gilroy, has acknowledged. \"If you look at a picture of young Stalin, isn\u2019t he glamorous,\" Gilroy said in an interview in\u00a0Rolling Stone in 2022. \"He looks like Diego!\"\nStalin took Russia from its war-ravaged imperial decline to a nuclear-armed superpower in just three decades, but also presided over a reign of authoritarian terror that starved, executed or imprisoned millions of its own citizens. Countless books had been written on his cruel years in power, but very little on his early years. Writer Simon Sebag Montefiore saw a gap, and began rifling through archives in post-Soviet countries to try and separate the truth from myth, and tell the little-known story of Stalin's early life.\nIn 2007 \u2013 a century after the infamous heist in Tiflis \u2013 Young Stalin was published. It delved into the early life of the Soviet Union's dictatorial leader. \"Should the life of a black-hearted ogre, a mass murderer who was the wickedest of the 20th-Century's monsters, be quite so entertaining,\" asked a review in The Observer at the time.\nOne person who read Young Stalin was Gilroy. The writer and producer, who had scripted the first four Bourne films and the Andor-precursor film, Rogue One, was planning a TV series that would explore Cassian Andor's journey from casual thief to rebellious figurehead. The true story of a revolutionary movement on the far fringes of a real empire gave Gilroy his source material. \"Literally, I\u2019m the classic old white guy who just can\u2019t get enough history,\" Gilroy said in Rolling Stone. \"The last 15 years, I\u2019ve been reading all non-fiction.\" He added that Young Stalin was \"an amazing book\" and that its account of the Tiflis bank robbery was an \"incredible movie sequence\".\nDid Sebag Montefiore ever think to himself, 'Here's the perfect setting for a Star Wars spin-off,' when he was researching his book? \"No, I didn't ever think that when I was toiling in the archives in Moscow and Tbilisi,\" he tells the BBC. \"But I did think that there was something pretty elemental about the life of Stalin, especially before 1917. It was a fascinating story, partly because no one knew about it.\"\nThe Tiflis heist was reported around the world and funded the revolutionaries' movement for years, says Sebag Montefiore. \"Lenin and the whole Bolshevik Party lived off that money until the [1917] revolution.\"\nSebag Montefiore says that the young Stalin and the troubled Andor bear striking similarities: \"A young man from nowhere with a revolutionary ideology, and a fight against a huge empire,\" the writer says. \"I did think there was something interesting about the secret life of someone in that situation. That's basically what Tony Gilroy has focused on in Andor.\"\nStalin was, of course, not the only figure fomenting turmoil in Tsarist Russia, and Andor fleshes out other characters with attributes from the young Georgian's contemporaries. Among Andor's co-conspirators in the Aldanhi heist is Karis Nemik (Alex Lawther), an idealist writing a high-minded manifesto for the emerging resistance, similar to Bolshevik Leon Trotsky's polemics amid the opulent decline of Romanov rule.\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's character, Luthen Rael, is an analogue for Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader who was able to form a powerful movement from unlikely bedfellows. A wealthy art collector, Luthen's precise manners in front of his gilded customers hide an uncompromising hatred of the empire and a restless desire to fund a growing resistance. In Cassian's talented, taciturn thief he sees a useful tool; Lenin saw the same in Stalin. \"In 1911, people said to Lenin, 'Why are you using this guy? He's a gangster. He's had people killed. He was involved in all these bank robberies,'\" says Sebag Montefiore. \"And Lenin replies, 'He's exactly the type we need.' Stalin could edit a paper. He could write and could read. And he was also someone who could arrange a hit on somebody and arrange a bank robbery. That was what Lenin talked about: some people were tea drinkers, and other people were thugs, Stalin could do both, and that's why Stalin won in the end.\"\u00a0\nThe research into historical rebellions \u2013 Gilroy has said he studied other revolutions while writing Andor, as well \u2013 has no doubt helped create the show's oddly realistic feel. Andor feels more down to earth than anything the Star Wars universe has shown us before, if you'll excuse the occasional spaceship roaring overhead, or an alien or two sitting in the local bar. There are flashes of mundane detail rarely scene in big-budget sci-fi. People complain that Andor's mother Maarva's (Fiona Shaw) house is always too cold. Security officer Syril Karn's (Kyle Soller) petulant intensity even extends to tailoring his uniform to make him look smarter than his contemporaries. The Imperial Security Bureau hoping to root out the emerging rebellion is a nest of competing ambitions that feels as real as anything in a historical drama \u2013 or in everyday office politik. There are fewer blaster-toting Stormtroopers than there are in the Star Wars films, and more sadistic, trenchcoated officers who would have been right at home in the Tsarist secret police, the Okhrana, or its Soviet replacement, the Cheka.\n\"In the past, Star Wars movies drop us in at a very big moment,\" says Walter Marsh, an Australian writer who praised Andor's grown-up worldview in The Guardian in 2022. \"There's the big climactic battle, or Luke Skywalker's heroic journey, and they're these big themes of good versus evil. But as any historian will tell you, wars and empires and revolutions don't start and end overnight, and there's always this bigger backstory. There's this sort of long tail. It takes years for that kind of colonial rot, those systems of control, to set in.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Japanese film that Star Wars stole from\n\u2022 The truth about Henry VIII's right-hand man\n\u2022 Black Mirror's most 'devastating' episode ever\nAndor shows the corruption and brutal entitlement found at every layer of autocratic regimes: the guards drinking in a brothel while they're supposed to be on duty (and prepared to shake down anyone they don't like the look of); the prison industrial system that requires constant additions even if the new prisoners have done nothing wrong; the subtle sabotage of ethnic pilgrimages to sacred land that is earmarked for imperial development. And with authoritarianism on the rise around the globe, Andor has as much to say about today's world as it does about Stalin's.\u00a0\n\"When the show came out I think I was pleasantly surprised to see a story in that universe that was familiar, but which also approached this question of empire that's been so central to the whole franchise, but was never actually tackled in a really nuanced and human character-driven way,\" Marsh tells the BBC. \"It's all well and good to have a big, evil Sith Lord achieve global, universal domination. But how does power assert itself on the street level, from one human to another?\n\"The Empire is this huge grinding, unthinking machine, but it's also a very human thing,\" Marsh continues. \"Who are the people that find a place and thrive in those systems?\" He remarks that in the original films the Imperials were little more than blank-and-you-miss-them pantomime villains: \"British guys in suits getting choked by Darth Vader at some point, who are just fiddling with buttons in the background.\"\nAndor's strength is its \"three-episode arcs that showed us the kind of death by a thousand cuts that it takes to achieve this sort of social, political and economic dominance\", says Marsh. \"The converse of that is it shows all the ways in which that kind of oppression inspires pushback and resistance in all kinds of different ways.\"\nThe new season, which begins on Tuesday 22 April, will develop the rebellion's story as it rushes towards the events seen in Rogue One: the scenes of brutal Imperial reactions to a demonstration shown in the trailer evoke the Tsarist crackdown on a St Petersburg march in 1905, which was a\u00a0 slow-burning contributor to the Bolshevik revolution.\n\"The scavenger who becomes a passionate revolutionary leader is kind of fascinating,\" says Sebag Montefiore of the troubled Cassian Andor. \"That's a great trajectory, because that's exactly what Stalin did. And it'll be interesting to see how deep Gilroy uses that \u2013 how far he goes to create a character with both heroic and villainous features.\"\nGeorge Lucas's original film trilogy rooted the rebellion in the classic good-guys-versus-bad-guys dynamic of countless Saturday matinee cliffhangers, the resistance modelled after anti-Nazi opposition in occupied Europe. The rebels of Andor inhabit a much more compromised reality; like real-life revolutionary movements, they are much more complicated than the ones we usually see on screen. Luthen, Andor's Lenin proxy, considers it with chilling deliberation in one of the first season's standout scenes: \"I'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else's future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I\u2019ll never see.\"\nAs Sebag Montefiore notes, the revolutionaries themselves knew deep down that if they took power, they themselves would have to use repression as a tool; they would become what they once despised. \"Lenin himself said: 'A revolution without firing squads is meaningless.'\"\u00a0\nAndor season two is available on Disney+ from 22 April.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Before Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened its sovereignty, the Canadian psyche was consumed with another major issue: housing affordability. With an election on the horizon, voters are wondering if any party has a plan to fix what has become a generational problem. \nWillow Yamauchi says she was just a \"regular\" person when she and her husband bought their family home in Vancouver 25 years ago for a modest sum of C$275,000 - around C$435,000 ($312,000; \u00a3236,400) in today's dollars.\nThat same property is now worth several million. \nIn the city on Canada's west coast, Ms Yamauchi's story is as common as the rainy weather. The average price of a detached home in Vancouver in 2000 was around C$350,000. Now, it is more than C$2m.\n\"My husband and I were very privileged to be able to purchase a house when we did,\" the 52-year-old writer tells the BBC. As a member of Generation X, timing was on her side. \nThe same, she says, cannot be said for younger people, who - without \"the bank of mom and dad\" - are effectively priced out of the city they grew up in.\nVancouver, a cultural and economic hub with a population of less than one million, is often seen as the epicentre of Canada's housing crisis. A report by Chapman University in California last year listed it among the top \"impossibly unaffordable\" cities in the world. \nBut it is not the only Canadian city where the cost of homes is out of reach for many. Canada as a whole has one of the highest house-price-to-income ratios among developed nations.\nIn 2021, the average household income after taxes in Canada was around C$88,000, according to national data. That same year, the average home price hit C$713,500 - more than eight times higher. The gap is even larger in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.\nFor many Canadians, housing is one of the top issues in the federal election, eclipsed only recently by US President Donald Trump and his tariffs on Canada. \nBefore Trump, concerns on housing affordability had boosted the Conservative Party, which has consistently been seen as the best equipped to fix the crisis. \nBut then a trade war with the US came along and it catapulted the governing Liberal party to the top of the polls.\nEven with the Trump factor, the topic featured prominently in the two election debates this week. During the French language one, moderator and journalist Patrice Roy displayed figures showing how much home prices had increased in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in the last decade. \n\"I'm sure this won't come as a surprise,\" Mr Roy told the federal leaders, before asking for their plans on how they would fix the crisis.\nPolls show young people are especially worried about the housing crisis and what it means for their future. \nSpeaking to students at the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Vancouver campus, it quickly became clear that the issue was top of mind for many.\nMany said they have either opted to live at home during their studies to save on costs, or are paying anywhere from C$1,100 to C$1,500 for a single room near campus, often in a home shared with five or six others.\nEmily Chu, a 24-year-old who is in her final semester at UBC, says that she at one point had to delay her studies by two years in order to work, as she struggled to afford paying both tuition and rent.\nShe now shares an apartment with her older brother, who works full-time and pays the majority of the rent. Ms Chu considers herself one of the lucky ones.\nAs for home ownership in the future, she says \"that's not even possible\" for most people her age. \"Everybody kind of assumes that we can't ever own housing.\"\nYoung professionals with well-paying jobs, like Margareta Dovgal, are also priced out. The 28-year-old director at Vancouver-based non-profit Resource Works told the BBC that she has considered moving to the neighbouring province of Alberta due to its lower cost of living, despite being a lifelong and \"committed Vancouverite\".\nStill, Calgary, Alberta's largest city, saw house prices increase by 15% in 2024 from the previous year as the city experienced its highest population growth rate since 2001.\nThe root causes of Canada's housing affordability crisis are complex. One of the main issues is a supply that has not kept up with a growing population, which has driven up costs for both buyers and renters. \nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the national housing agency, estimates that more than 3.8 million homes need to be built in the next six years to address the shortage.\nConstruction of new housing, however, has been well below that target, raising questions on whether Canada will meet this goal. Experts say barriers to ramping up building include the high cost and scarcity of land in urban areas, where most Canadians tend to live and work.\nThere are also regional barriers, like city zoning laws that prevent the construction of more affordable, higher density housing - including apartment buildings or multiplexes - in some neighbourhoods.\nDaniel Oleksiuk, co-founder of the advocacy group Abundant Housing Vancouver, says his city is one example, where more than half of the land has historically been zoned for single-family homes.\n\"We've kept almost all of the land reserved,\" Mr Oleksiuk told the BBC. \"There are whole neighbourhoods where all you have is three to five million dollar homes.\"\nOn the campaign trail, each major federal party has put forward a plan to fix the crisis, all with the goal of building as many homes as quickly as possible.\nThe Liberals, led by Mark Carney, said their aim is to build 500,000 new homes a year with the help of a new government agency called Build Canada Homes that would oversee and finance the construction of affordable housing in Canada - a plan similar to one implemented after the Second World War to house veterans.\nCritics have questioned whether Carney's target is viable, as it would require Canada to more than double its current construction rate.\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, vowed to tie federal funding to housing starts by rewarding cities that build more homes and penalising those that block construction - a carrot-and-stick approach. \nPoilievre also promised to remove federal taxes on newly constructed homes in an effort to cut costs to would-be homebuyers. Critics, however, say this policy may have minimal effect, as most homes purchased in Canada are resold, rather than brand new.\nVoters who spoke to the BBC say they welcome any plan to ramp up housing construction in Canada.\nWhile much of housing is governed by provinces and cities, Ms Dovgal notes that the federal government has an ability \"to lead persuasively\" and implement measures that make it cheaper and easier to build across the country. \nBut others watching the issue closely caution that the steps proposed may not be enough. \nPaul Kershaw, a public policy professor at UBC and founder of think tank Generation Squeeze, argues that politicians have failed to address the elephant in the room: the wealth older homeowners have generated off the housing crisis.\n\"The political bargain has asked younger Canadians to suffer higher rents and mortgages in order to protect those higher home values,\" Kershaw notes.\n\"None of the parties are really naming that generational tension,\" he says, adding that politicians may privately feel there is a political risk in trying to stall the cost of housing, and thus, older Canadians' assets.\nProf Kershaw calls this a \"cultural problem\", and says that parties should also focus on reducing costs for younger people as a way to alleviate this generational burden.\nFixing the housing crisis, he argues, is just as integral as asserting sovereignty and prosperity in the face of threats posed by Trump's tariffs.\nThe \"dysfunction that has entered our housing market is disruptive to the well-being of the country\", he says. \nUntil a fix is found, the possibility of homeownership still looks bleak for many. \nMs Dovgal contends half-heartedly that, other than moving elsewhere, \"you have to win the lottery, or marry a multi-millionaire. These are kind of the options\".",

        "article_text": "Artists and creatives are pushing back against a recent trend using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate \"starter pack\" images of people as toys - which they say may be in danger of risking their livelihoods.\nSince the start of April, thousands of people have uploaded their photos to generate images of themselves as dolls, despite warnings of damaging the environment, giving away personal information, and devaluing creativity.\nNick Lavallee, who has made custom action figures for six years, told the BBC he was concerned his work may be at risk after \"AI images saturated social media\".\n\"People are sick of them,\" he said. \"It's an artistic aesthetic - AI-generated art diminishes that.\"\nNick has made figures of - and for - comedians, film directors, and artists such as Weezer and Tyler Childers, which sell for as much as $250 (\u00a3188) online on his Wicked Joyful website.\nHis success has led to a clothing brand and will soon be followed by a physical shop in his hometown of Manchester, New Hampshire.\nBut he's concerned action figure commissions could soon dry up, as well as the public perception of his work, from thousands of AI images mimicking his passion.\nThe feeling has been shared by other creatives with the rise of the #StarterPackNoAI movement, which has been used thousands of times since first appearing on Instagram in early April before spreading to X soon after.\nAfter Patouret's post, others quickly joined the counter-trend, with artist Maria Picass\u00f3 Piquer saying she chose to take part \"for fun, but also as a statement\".\n\"While AI pieces all looked more or less the same, I was amazed at the variety of the 'human' works,\" she said.\n\"Plus, self-portraits added an extra layer of, well, humanity.\"\nMaria, like many other artists, sees the dual risk of AI images threatening intellectual property rights by being \"fed on 'stolen' art\", and the possibility of reducing her finding new clients.\nIllustrator Dav le Dessineux, working in Bordeaux, France, said some in his industry had already lost contracts to AI design work.\nHe contributed his starter\u00a0pack because \"like many artists who use their real hands\", he was \"tired\" of the deluge of AI-generated doll images.\nDav's illustration featured only a pencil and sheet of white paper - tools he said are \"all you need to start being an artist\".\n\"People usually forget about it because of the technology surrounding us, but we really don't need more than basic stuff to create something and be original,\" he said.\nEli Dibitonto, an artist living in Barletta, Italy, agreed, describing the process of digitally illustrating his own starter pack as \"carefree and fun\".\n\"It doesn't have to be perfect - mine isn't,\" he said. \"Art isn't meant to be perfect or look flawless.\"\nAnd illustrator and student Evie Joyce said creating her own artwork meant being able to consider what to reflect of her personality during a process lasting several hours, rather than seconds.\n\"I think that what's so magical about it is you're seeing people put time and effort and their personality, all of their experiences, into pieces of art,\" she said.\n\"With AI, it can even steal from artists and steal their work and their style, it just loses that touch of personality.\"\nBack in New Hampshire, Nick understands the rebellion from illustrators, but says he believes there is use for AI.\n\"I don't necessarily want to say AI is bad when I know that it could be a useful tool,\" he said.\n\"I think all of us have experimented with it.\"\nAnd Henk van Ess, a global expert in using AI in investigative research, has proven how useful it can be - but it would be safe to say he does not believe it lies in starter packs.\n\"It's like watching a supercomputer calculate how many Hobnobs fit in a Sports Direct mug, while solving climate change sits on the 'to-do' list,\" he said.\n\"Technically impressive? Sure. But it's the technological equivalent of using the Large Hadron Collider to heat up your Pot Noodle.\n\"While everyone's busy generating these digital equivalents of small talk, they're missing the actually revolutionary stuff AI can do - it's just wasteful to put all that energy into creating digital fluff when we can use it for solving real-world problems.\"\nAnd Nick remains positive.\n\"The musicians who get my stuff, who are excited to hold a Wicked Joyful in their hands, they know it's my artwork, they know it's mine,\" he said.\nLikewise, Dav is confident in the worth of human work.\nDespite the rise of pre-fabricated furniture, he says, \"people still call on cabinetmakers\".\n\"I hope I'll be one of those artisans,\" he said.\nNick, who says he found his purpose \"in bringing joy to people\" with his creations, said he similarly wanted to remain hopeful about the future.\n\"I really hope people are totally sick of AI action figures,\" he said.\n\"But I hope that they are smart enough to understand the difference in something that I'm doing versus what is computer-generated.\"",

        "article_text": "Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.\nRice is a staple food for more than half of the global population. It is consumed on a daily basis by more people than either wheat or maize, also known as corn.\nSo it is with some concern that scientists have unveiled a recent finding: that as carbon emissions rise and the Earth continues to warm, so too will arsenic levels in rice.\nThe presence of arsenic in rice has long been known as a problem. Almost all rice contains arsenic. The harmful, naturally occurring chemical can accumulate in the soil of paddy fields, leaching into the grains of rice grown there. But the amounts found in rice grains can vary considerably from well below the recommended limits set by regulatory bodies to several times higher.\nYet, consuming even low amounts of inorganic arsenic through food or drinking water can lead to cancers and a range of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nResearchers around the world have been working on ways to reduce the levels of arsenic in rice \u2013 and in the meantime, there are ways of cooking it that can extract some of this harmful element from grains (see the box further down the story for more).\nBut a new study of inorganic arsenic accumulation has found it may become a greater problem due to climate change. The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.\nThey found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.\n\"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health \u2013 it's a long laundry list,\" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. \"And two metrics of climate change \u2013 the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures \u2013 are resulting in greater amounts.\"\nIt's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions \"business as usual\" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.\nWhile the researchers focused on locations in China for their experiments, they say such impacts are likely to be seen in rice grown in regions including Europe and the US too, as inorganic arsenic is common in rice grown around the world.\n\"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature \u2013 but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us,\" says Ziska.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 Saving Italy's polluted sea\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\nOf course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice \u2013 so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.\nStill, this is \"one of the most comprehensive studies\" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study. \"This is as robust as you\u2019re ever likely to get.\"\nHumans have known for hundreds of years that arsenic is toxic. Its tasteless, colourless, odourless nature even made it a preferred method for dispatching enemies in the courts of ancient Rome and medieval Europe. But in single doses at trace amounts, it does not cause poisoning.\nOver the last few decades scientists have discovered that even lower amounts of arsenic can cause health impacts when exposure happens chronically over a lifetime.\nThis is particularly true of inorganic arsenic, which is more readily able to attach to biomolecules in the human body where it can cause harm. While naturally occurring in rocks and soils, inorganic arsenic can be a byproduct of activities like mining, coal burning and other industrial processes. (Read more about why \"natural\" doesn\u2019t always mean better).\nThis means inorganic arsenic is particularly prevalent in the groundwater in a number of regions, including South America and parts of southern and central Asia. But people elsewhere are vulnerable too: in the US, for example, more than 7% of private well owners, or 2.1 million people, are drinking dangerous levels of inorganic arsenic. Worldwide, some 140 million people drink water with arsenic levels above the WHO-recommended guidelines.\u00a0\nAnd, outside of drinking water, the main source of dietary exposure to arsenic worldwide is rice. In regions that tend to have little arsenic in their groundwater, like Europe, rice is the single biggest source of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.\nLowering the arsenic in your rice\nIf you want to lower your arsenic exposure from rice, there are a few things you can do.\nFirst, some types of rice have more inorganic arsenic than others. White rice has a lower inorganic arsenic content than brown rice but has less nutritional value. Basmati rice has less inorganic arsenic than other varieties. And rice from certain areas, including east Africa, has less arsenic than rice from other areas, including parts of the US, Europe, and south-east Asia.\nResearchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK also recently discovered a way of cooking rice that can remove 50% of the arsenic in brown rice and 74% from white rice. They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.\nThe UK's Food Standard's Agency recommends rinsing your rice before cooking and then boiling it in six parts water to one part rice before draining and rinsing again.\nThe problem comes down to how around 75% of the world's supply of rice is grown, says Ziska \u2013 in irrigated paddy fields.\nRice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. \"That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe,\" Ziska says. \"But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil.\" In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate reactions with other minerals in the soil that make the arsenic more bioavailable and easier for the rice plants to absorb through their root systems.\n\"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own,\" Ziska says. It changes the microbiome of the soil in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.\nAnd this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. \"This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active,\" Ziska says. \"It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy.\"\nZiska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.\nWhat worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment of inorganic arsenic's \"cancer potency factor\", taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that \"arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed\", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the risk of skin cancer, but lung and bladder cancers.\nAside from cancer, inorganic arsenic raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes. When consumed by pregnant women, it also makes foetal or infant mortality more likely, as well as raises the risk that the infant will be born low birth weight \u2013 which can have lifelong health impacts such as cardiovascular disease \u2013 or have developmental neurocognitive effects.\nFor individuals, the risks are slight. For example, the latest EPA review found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day \u2013 or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person \u2013 would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.\nBut across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.\nInorganic arsenic\nIf everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, the EPA calculates that \u2013 compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic \u2013 an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.\nThe amount of inorganic arsenic in rice varies enormously. But one study found that the global median amount is 66 micrograms per kg of rice. The EU set a limit in 2023 on inorganic arsenic in rice at 200 micrograms per kg of rice.\nSo, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?\n\"We can't pretend that we're going to take rice off the table. That's not feasible,\" says Nachman. As well as an important food tradition, rice is important to people living in poverty, some of whom get up to half of their daily calories from rice alone. \"But we need to do something differently.\"\nResearchers have also been experimenting with whether different types of water management could reduce arsenic levels. One process \u2013 where, instead of flooding a field continuously, the field is partly flooded, drained and then flooded again \u2013 does seem to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic. \"But that just increases cadmium,\" Marham says. \"And cadmium is perceived as an even bigger threat.\" Cadmium can cause breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancers, as well as liver and kidney disease.\nThere is also interest in trying to breed varieties of rice that take up less inorganic arsenic, but this hasn't yet panned out, researchers say.\nBecause some types of rice accumulate less inorganic arsenic, there is interest in exploring their cultivation. Another solution might be adding sulphur to water, which can absorb electrons, like arsenic. Another way to shift the microbiome of fields could be adding certain types of fertiliser \u2013 one combination found to decrease arsenic content has been a mix of mountain thyme and bird manure. But more research on any of these approaches is needed.\nAnother approach may be to grow rice under rainwater-fed conditions, or where both the soil and irrigation water are lower in arsenic. Rice from East Africa, which tends to be rainwater- rather than irrigation-fed, has been found to be particularly low in inorganic arsenic, as has rice in Indonesia. Rice grown in the US, Central and South America, south-east Asia, Europe and Australia all have been found to have higher amounts of arsenic.\nThere also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say. \"Policymakers have been dragging their feet for decades on this,\" says Marham.\u00a0\nCurrently, the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate arsenic levels in rice but has set a limit of 0.1mg/kg of rice intended for consumption by children. In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.\n\"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown,\" Ziska says. \"It really needs attention, because it affects so many individuals globally.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In January, Lina went to the police.\nHer ex-partner had been threatening her at home in the Spanish seaside town of Benalm\u00e1dena. That day, he'd allegedly raised his hand as if to hit her.\n\"There had been violent episodes - she was scared,\" Lina's cousin Daniel recalls.\nWhen she got to the police station, she was interviewed and her case registered with VioG\u00e9n, a digital tool which assesses the likelihood of a woman being attacked again by the same man.\nVioG\u00e9n - an algorithm-based system - asks 35 questions about the abuse and its intensity, the aggressor's access to weapons, his mental health and whether the woman has left, or is considering leaving, the relationship.\nIt then records the threat to her as \"negligible\", \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\" or \"extreme\".\nThe category is used to make decisions about the allocation of police resources to protect the woman.\nLina was deemed to be at \"medium\" risk.\nShe asked for a restraining order at a specialist gender violence court in Malaga, so that her ex-partner couldn't be in contact with her or share her living space.  The request was denied.\n\"Lina wanted to change the locks at her home, so she could live peacefully with her children,\" says her cousin.\nThree weeks later, she was dead. Her partner had allegedly used his key to enter her flat and soon the house was on fire.\nWhile her children, mother and ex-partner all escaped, Lina didn't. Her 11-year-old son was widely reported as telling police it was his father who killed his mother.\nLina's lifeless body was retrieved from the charred interior of her home. Her ex-partner, the father of her three youngest children, was arrested.\nNow, her death is raising questions about VioG\u00e9n and its ability to keep women safe in Spain.\nVioG\u00e9n didn't accurately predict the threat to Lina.\nAs a woman designated at \"medium\" risk, the protocol is that she would be followed up again by a nominated police officer within 30 days. \nBut Lina was dead before that. If she had been \"high\" risk, the police follow-up would have happened within a week.  Could that have made a difference to Lina?\nTools to evaluate the threat of repeat domestic violence are used in North America and across Europe. In the UK, some police forces use DARA (Domestic Abuse Risk Assessment) - essentially a checklist. And DASH (Domestic Abuse, Stalking, Harassment and Honour-based Violence Assessment) may be employed by police or others, like social workers, to assess the risk of another attack.\nBut only in Spain is an algorithm woven so tightly into police practice. VioG\u00e9n was developed by Spanish police and academics.  It's used everywhere apart from the Basque Country and Catalonia (those regions have separate systems, although police co-operation is nationwide).\nThe head of the National Police's family and women's unit in Malaga, Ch Insp Isabel Espejo, describes VioG\u00e9n as \"super-important\". \n\"It helps us follow each victim's case very precisely,\" she says.\nHer officers deal with an average of 10 reports of gender violence a day. And every month, VioG\u00e9n classifies nine or 10 women as being at \"extreme\" risk of repeat victimisation. \nThe resource implications in those cases are huge: 24-hour police protection for a woman until the circumstances change and the risk decreases. Women assessed as \"high\" risk may also get an officer escort.\nA 2014 study found that officers accepted VioG\u00e9n's evaluation of the likelihood of repeated abuse 95% of the time. Critics suggest police are abdicating decision-making about women's safety to an algorithm.\nCh Insp Espejo says that the algorithm's calculation of risk is usually adequate. But she recognises  - even though Lina's case wasn't under her command - that something went wrong with Lina's assessment.\n\"I'm not going to say VioG\u00e9n doesn't fail \u2013 it does. But this wasn't the trigger that led to this woman's murder. The only guilty party is the person who killed Lina. Total security just doesn't exist,\" she says.\nBut at \"medium\" risk, Lina was never a police priority. And did Lina's VioG\u00e9n assessment have an impact on the court's decision to deny her a restraining order against her ex-partner?\nCourt authorities didn't give us permission to meet the judge who denied Lina an injunction against her ex-partner - a woman attacked on social media after Lina's death.\nInstead, another of Malaga's gender violence judges, Maria del Carmen Guti\u00e9rrez tells us in general terms that such an order needs two things: evidence of a crime and the threat of serious danger to the victim.\n\"VioG\u00e9n is one element I use to assess that danger, but it's far from the only one,\" she says.\nSometimes, the judge says, she makes restraining orders in cases where VioG\u00e9n has assessed a woman as at \"negligible\" or \"low\" risk.  On other occasions she may conclude there's no danger to a woman deemed at \"medium\" or \"high\" risk of repeat victimisation.\nDr Juan Jose Medina, a criminologist at the University of Seville, says Spain has a \"postcode lottery\" for women applying for restraining orders \u2013 some jurisdictions are much more likely to grant them than others.  But we don't know systematically how VioG\u00e9n influences the courts, or the police, because studies haven't been done.\n\"How are police officers and other stakeholders using this tool, and how is it informing their decision-making? We don't have good answers,\" he says.\nSpain's interior ministry hasn't often allowed academics access to VioG\u00e9n's data. And there hasn't been an independent audit of the algorithm. \nGemma Galdon, the founder of Eticas \u2013 an organisation working on the social and ethical impact of technology \u2013 says if you don't audit these systems, you won't know if they're actually delivering police protection to the right women.\nExamples of algorithmic bias elsewhere are well-documented.  In the US, analysis from 2016 of a recidivism tool found black defendants were more likely than their white peers to be incorrectly judged to be at higher risk of repeat offending. At the same time, white defendants were more likely than black defendants to be wrongly flagged as low risk.\nIn 2018, Spain's interior ministry didn't give a green light to an Eticas proposal to conduct a confidential, pro-bono, internal audit. So instead, Gemma Galdon and her colleagues decided to reverse-engineer VioG\u00e9n and do an external audit. \nThey used interviews with women survivors of domestic abuse and publicly available information - including data from the judiciary about women who, like Lina, had been killed.\nThey found that between 2003 and 2021, 71 women murdered by their partners or ex-partners had previously reported domestic abuse to the police.  Those recorded on the VioG\u00e9n system were given risk levels of \"negligible\" or \"medium\".\n\"What we'd like to know is, were those error rates that cannot be mitigated in any way? Or could we have done something to improve how these systems assign risk and protect those women better?\" asks Gemma Galdon.\nThe head of gender violence research at Spain's interior ministry, Juan Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez-Ossorio, is dismissive of the Eticas investigation: it wasn't done with VioG\u00e9n data. \"If you don't have access to the data, how can you interpret it?\" he says.\nAnd he is wary of an external audit, fearing it could compromise both the security of women whose cases are recorded and VioG\u00e9n's procedures.\n\"What we know is that once a woman reports a man and she's under police protection, the probability of further violence is substantially lowered - we've no doubts about that,\" says L\u00f3pez-Ossorio.\nVioG\u00e9n has evolved since it was introduced in Spain.  The questionnaire has been refined, and the \"negligible\" category of risk will soon be abolished. And even critics agree it makes sense to have a standardised system responding to gender violence.\nIn Benalm\u00e1dena, Lina's home has become a shrine.\nFlowers, candles and pictures of saints were left on the step. A small poster stuck on the wall declared: Benalm\u00e1dena says no to gender violence. The community fundraised for Lina's children.\nHer cousin, Daniel, says everyone's still reeling from news of her death.\n\"The family it's destroyed \u2013 especially Lina's mother,\" he says.\n\"She's 82 years old. I don't think there's anything sadder than to have your daughter killed by an aggressor in a way that could have been avoided. The children are still in shock \u2013 they'll need a lot of psychological help.\"",

        "article_text": "In a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it \u2013 and that's what makes it magical.\nIn the Sandhills region of North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.\nThe region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.\nPeople largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm \u2013 think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.\nThe prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the \"cradle of American golf\", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.\nHunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and \u2013 the star attraction \u2013 imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nBut travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.\n\"It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,\" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.\nBurns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.\nDon Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (\u00a313) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about \u00a358) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.\nPlan your trip\n- If you\u2019re looking to purchase your own jar of amethyst treasure, keep an eye out online for availability toward late July.

He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.\nHowever, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, \"to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way\".\nBurns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. \"One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it.\" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. \"Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.\nThere's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers \u2013 who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff \u2013 can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets \u2013 and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Leicester have been relegated from the Premier League after defeat to Liverpool \nThe banner flown over the King Power Stadium made its point. \n'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool.\nA second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwards as Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winner put the visitors within three points of the Premier League title.\nIt has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. \nThe drop had been coming - Leicester have won just once since December - and there was an air of resignation around the ground, even before Alexander-Arnold's strike. \nThere are unhappy and disconnected fans, players accused of giving up, and a manager in Ruud van Nistelrooy who, despite his pedigree as a player, has seen the Foxes get worse on his watch. \nThere were some boos at full-time, but the majority of home fans had already left. Those who stayed offered a smattering of applause, yet it was an empty gesture.\nIt reflected a club in need of a rebuild but how, and with who, are the biggest questions as Leicester - champions of England nine years ago - face one of their biggest crossroads.\nLeicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold moves Liverpool closer to title\n'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\n'My responsibility to lead the club in the best way' - Nistelrooy\nWhen the Foxes sacked Steve Cooper in October they were 16th, although the cracks were there.\nThe teething problems in moving away from Enzo Maresca's style - less expansive and working the ball quicker - were just part of the issue. \nThe departed Maresca, who led them to the Championship title last season before joining Chelsea, was well-liked by the squad and Cooper struggled to connect with players, even if some of the senior members of the squad - including Jamie Vardy - were onside. \nThere was growing concern from the club that any disconnect would impact their survival prospects, and one of the reasons why they dismissed Cooper. \nSo, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.\nFormer Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.\nYet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.\nThey have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.\nThe Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. \nThat is in stark contrast to the lack of goals under Van Nistelrooy - a revered striker for Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Netherlands - and they have scored just six times in the league since the draw with Brighton on 8 December.\nAnother goalless outing against Liverpool extended the home goal drought to nine league games and 810 minutes - the worst in top-flight history.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"They have some big decisions to make. It has been awful for them. They have been miles off it.\"\nSome players have recently raised concerns over the standard and intensity of training with the drop-off being connected to Leicester's impending relegation, which was becoming increasingly inevitable.\nThe fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks - Van Nistelrooy has dropped him for the last four games for refusing to agree to stay at the training ground one night a week - emphasises the growing tensions. \nWhen asked about whether he had been able to improve the standards and culture in his five months at the club, Van Nistelrooy was clear.\n\"When you don't combine them with results it's always hard. There's no negotiation on these standards and I hold everyone accountable on those,\" the Dutchman said this month. \n\"I know how I worked from a village of 5,000 people in the middle of nowhere to Manchester United and Real Madrid. I know what is necessary to stay at the highest level and I know there are so many people working at this football club who have the quality to do so. But not enough yet. \n\"In difficult moments you get to know people and characters very well. I speak about standards and what is needed to perform at the highest level and that's a culture which needs to be created in this club.\"\nDefender Conor Coady has been one trying to raise spirits at the club's Seagrave training base, but it has been an almost impossible task with results - and he admitted Leicester have not been good enough. \n\"We've took a bit of stick and we'll continue to take stick because it's deserved,\" said the former England centre-back. \"From minute one this season, we haven't been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it'll chew you up and spit you out.\"\nSusan Whelan, Jon Rudkin and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha watched Leicester's defeat to Liverpool\nAs the plane's banner suggested, director of football Jon Rudkin and the board have been the target for fans this season.\nThey see Rudkin as a root cause of their decline in recent seasons. He was, of course, in the same position when the Foxes stunned the world to win the Premier League in 2016, but supporters have made up their minds. \nIt does not help that the hierarchy rarely speak publicly, allowing supporters to understand and digest the situation.\nChief executive Susan Whelan twice met with the Foxes Trust and the club's Fan Advisory Board in February for candid and constructive meetings but the wider fanbase remain disconnected.\nDoes chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha decide to make a change at the top, does head of recruitment Martyn Glover's position come under more scrutiny following a number of poor transfer windows, regardless of financial constraints?\nVan Nistelrooy's position remains a doubt and it is hard to see a long-term future in the wake of damning statistics. \nDefeat against Liverpool leaves him with the unenviable record of having lost 17 of his 22 games, winning just three. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?\nVan Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.\n\"It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there.\n\"The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it. In a situation like this you have to sit very carefully with the club to discuss the matters.\"\nYet sacking a second manager of the season has financial consequences and with money tight, it will be a consideration. Can Leicester financially afford to sack Van Nistelrooy but, going forward, can they afford not to?\nThere is also an acceptance the squad needs a reset but only three players are out of contract - goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, and 38-year-old captain Jamie Vardy. \nWhat happens with Vardy - influential at the club as their last remaining title winner and the scorer of 198 goals - remains open, but it's the biggest decision the club has to make in terms of the squad given his reputation and achievements.\nIt means Leicester must shift big earners to make wholesale changes to a squad which has, in the main, brought them down twice.\nWilfred Ndidi signed a new three-year contract last summer but his appetite for another Championship campaign is likely to have waned and the same will go for defenders Ricardo Pereira and Wout Faes. Although, as part of Leicester's decline, they must find takers.\nGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been a rare bright spot and will have his admirers, as will Bilal El Khannouss, despite an underwhelming first season in England, while Winks' situation could depend on Van Nistelrooy's exit. \nLike every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.\nLeicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.\nYet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float.  \nFor now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with.\nThey made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. This time their short-term future is far less certain.",

His family and attorneys have fiercely denied he is a member of MS-13. \nVan Hollen said he was initially blocked from meeting Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by Salvadoran authorities. Later, he said government officials helped facilitate a meeting and Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was brought to the senator's hotel.\n\"His conversation with me was the first communication that he had with anybody outside of prison since he was abducted,\" Van Hollen said.\n\"He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes.\"\nVan Hollen added that conditions in the new prison, in the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana, were better.\n\"He still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world,\" Van Hollen said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's case is part of a simmering showdown between the Trump administration and the US courts system on the issue of immigration. \nA separate feud has been brewing after a judge said he could hold the Trump administration in contempt for its \"wilful disregard\" of his order barring deportation flights. \nMultiple judges - including a unanimous US Supreme Court ruling - said the government should facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return to the US.

His wife said he \"worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites\". \nAt the heart of the case, though, are the allegations of his involvement in MS-13, which the Trump administration used to expel him under the Alien Enemies Act.\nThe president has evoked the law to deport hundreds so far, by arguing the alleged gang members were terrorists. \nSen Van Hollen said the Trump administration wants to \"flat out lie about what this case is about\". \n\"If you want to make claims about \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, you should present them in the courts, not on social media,\" he said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was arrested by immigration authorities on 12 March in Baltimore, before being deported from Texas to El Salvador on 15 March.

        "article_text": "Leicester have been relegated from the Premier League after defeat to Liverpool \nThe banner flown over the King Power Stadium made its point. \n'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool.\nA second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwards as Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winner put the visitors within three points of the Premier League title.\nIt has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. \nThe drop had been coming - Leicester have won just once since December - and there was an air of resignation around the ground, even before Alexander-Arnold's strike. \nThere are unhappy and disconnected fans, players accused of giving up, and a manager in Ruud van Nistelrooy who, despite his pedigree as a player, has seen the Foxes get worse on his watch. \nThere were some boos at full-time, but the majority of home fans had already left. Those who stayed offered a smattering of applause, yet it was an empty gesture.\nIt reflected a club in need of a rebuild but how, and with who, are the biggest questions as Leicester - champions of England nine years ago - face one of their biggest crossroads.\nLeicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold moves Liverpool closer to title\n'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\n'My responsibility to lead the club in the best way' - Nistelrooy\nWhen the Foxes sacked Steve Cooper in October they were 16th, although the cracks were there.\nThe teething problems in moving away from Enzo Maresca's style - less expansive and working the ball quicker - were just part of the issue. \nThe departed Maresca, who led them to the Championship title last season before joining Chelsea, was well-liked by the squad and Cooper struggled to connect with players, even if some of the senior members of the squad - including Jamie Vardy - were onside. \nThere was growing concern from the club that any disconnect would impact their survival prospects, and one of the reasons why they dismissed Cooper. \nSo, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.\nFormer Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.\nYet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.\nThey have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.\nThe Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. \nThat is in stark contrast to the lack of goals under Van Nistelrooy - a revered striker for Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Netherlands - and they have scored just six times in the league since the draw with Brighton on 8 December.\nAnother goalless outing against Liverpool extended the home goal drought to nine league games and 810 minutes - the worst in top-flight history.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"They have some big decisions to make. It has been awful for them. They have been miles off it.\"\nSome players have recently raised concerns over the standard and intensity of training with the drop-off being connected to Leicester's impending relegation, which was becoming increasingly inevitable.\nThe fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks - Van Nistelrooy has dropped him for the last four games for refusing to agree to stay at the training ground one night a week - emphasises the growing tensions. \nWhen asked about whether he had been able to improve the standards and culture in his five months at the club, Van Nistelrooy was clear.\n\"When you don't combine them with results it's always hard. There's no negotiation on these standards and I hold everyone accountable on those,\" the Dutchman said this month. \n\"I know how I worked from a village of 5,000 people in the middle of nowhere to Manchester United and Real Madrid. I know what is necessary to stay at the highest level and I know there are so many people working at this football club who have the quality to do so. But not enough yet. \n\"In difficult moments you get to know people and characters very well. I speak about standards and what is needed to perform at the highest level and that's a culture which needs to be created in this club.\"\nDefender Conor Coady has been one trying to raise spirits at the club's Seagrave training base, but it has been an almost impossible task with results - and he admitted Leicester have not been good enough. \n\"We've took a bit of stick and we'll continue to take stick because it's deserved,\" said the former England centre-back. \"From minute one this season, we haven't been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it'll chew you up and spit you out.\"\nSusan Whelan, Jon Rudkin and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha watched Leicester's defeat to Liverpool\nAs the plane's banner suggested, director of football Jon Rudkin and the board have been the target for fans this season.\nThey see Rudkin as a root cause of their decline in recent seasons. He was, of course, in the same position when the Foxes stunned the world to win the Premier League in 2016, but supporters have made up their minds. \nIt does not help that the hierarchy rarely speak publicly, allowing supporters to understand and digest the situation.\nChief executive Susan Whelan twice met with the Foxes Trust and the club's Fan Advisory Board in February for candid and constructive meetings but the wider fanbase remain disconnected.\nDoes chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha decide to make a change at the top, does head of recruitment Martyn Glover's position come under more scrutiny following a number of poor transfer windows, regardless of financial constraints?\nVan Nistelrooy's position remains a doubt and it is hard to see a long-term future in the wake of damning statistics. \nDefeat against Liverpool leaves him with the unenviable record of having lost 17 of his 22 games, winning just three. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?\nVan Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.\n\"It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there.\n\"The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it. In a situation like this you have to sit very carefully with the club to discuss the matters.\"\nYet sacking a second manager of the season has financial consequences and with money tight, it will be a consideration. Can Leicester financially afford to sack Van Nistelrooy but, going forward, can they afford not to?\nThere is also an acceptance the squad needs a reset but only three players are out of contract - goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, and 38-year-old captain Jamie Vardy. \nWhat happens with Vardy - influential at the club as their last remaining title winner and the scorer of 198 goals - remains open, but it's the biggest decision the club has to make in terms of the squad given his reputation and achievements.\nIt means Leicester must shift big earners to make wholesale changes to a squad which has, in the main, brought them down twice.\nWilfred Ndidi signed a new three-year contract last summer but his appetite for another Championship campaign is likely to have waned and the same will go for defenders Ricardo Pereira and Wout Faes. Although, as part of Leicester's decline, they must find takers.\nGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been a rare bright spot and will have his admirers, as will Bilal El Khannouss, despite an underwhelming first season in England, while Winks' situation could depend on Van Nistelrooy's exit. \nLike every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.\nLeicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.\nYet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float.  \nFor now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with.\nThey made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. This time their short-term future is far less certain.",

The curious case of Swiatek's hex against Ostapenko - Second ServePublished21 April 2025, 11:31 BSTIn the latest edition of Second Serve, our new weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the key talking points.Usually Iga Swiatek is the one dishing out the bagels.In recent years, the five-time major champion has become known for the ruthless manner of her victories, subjecting many opponents to the ultimate embarrassment of losing a set without winning a game.Now 23-year-old Swiatek finds herself in the position of being on the wrong end of a 6-0 scoreline - having lost to Jelena Ostapenko for the sixth time in a row.Ostapenko extended her flawless head-to-head record against the world number two in the Stuttgart quarter-finals on Saturday.So what's behind the one-sided results?Having won the 2017 French Open, Ostapenko certainly has the pedigree and her explosive ball-bashing - when it works, and the winners outweigh the unforced errors - can have devastating consequences.Swiatek has encountered trouble against aggressive ball-strikers, too, so that adds further weight to the explanation.You also wonder whether there is a mental block against an opponent who a player knows has their number.Swiatek disputed that afterwards, saying her head \"was much more clear\" against Ostapenko in Stuttgart than her previous defeats.While the agony was prolonged, you can't imagine a player of Swiatek's quality will suffer a career-spanning hex.There is a long way to go until Swiatek enters the conversation of being on the receiving end of the most dominant head-to-head record.Gael Monfils has lost all 20 of his matches (so far) against Novak Djokovic, while Richard Gasquet's 18-0 record against Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer's 17-0 against Roger Federer are other notable lopsided match-ups in recent years.In fact, Swiatek could end the chastening run as early as next week, with Ostapenko slated to be a prospective last-16 opponent in Madrid.British number four Harriet Dart caused a stink by telling her French opponent to put on deodorant at the Rouen Open.Rafael Nadal might not be playing the French Open this year - a strange feeling indeed - but the 14-time men's singles champion will be honoured in a ceremony at Roland Garros.Serena Williams claims she would have been treated differently to Jannik Sinner if she had failed two doping tests.The two-year wait is over for Holger Rune.

        "article_text": "On the morning of 8 December 2024, I waited anxiously at the Lebanese border, hoping to get into Syria as soon as the crossing opened, not knowing what to expect.\nBashar al-Assad, the president of 24 years, was gone. Opposition fighters had advanced towards Damascus, taking major cities including Aleppo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing: Syria was free.\nLike many Syrians, I'd only ever known the country under the rule of Assad and his father Hafez, who had been in power from 1971 until 2000. Life under the Assads had meant more than 50 years of disappearances, incarceration - and the civil war that began in 2011 had claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Syrians.\nI'd been detained at the start of the uprising that year, and several times afterwards; I witnessed men lined up to be beaten and heard screams of torture. Even after I left the country in 2013, I learnt that security forces had broken into my apartment in Damascus and vandalised it.\nI assumed I'd lost my home country for good, then suddenly last year the dictatorship was toppled in just over a week. As I crossed the border into the country without fear of arrest, and watched rebel fighters shoot celebratory gunfire, while people rejoiced on the streets, I felt like laughing and crying at once.\nFor weeks, Damascus's main Umayyad Square became a hub of celebrations. Young and old talked freely about politics and everywhere Syria's future was debated openly; among street vendors and taxi drivers, boys cleaning shoes. All of this was unthinkable under Assad, as Syrians could never protest freely for fear of reprisals.\nOnly now, four months on, the situation is more complex. Though great strides have been made in gaining some social freedoms, there are growing concerns around what democracy will look like but also around the role of Islam in the new regime.\nSo, how long might these social freedoms remain \u2013 or could, as some fear, the newly won liberties be short-lived?\nAt Rawda Caf\u00e9 in central Damascus, just across the road from Parliament, intellectuals gather around long tables to smoke shisha and discuss culture. Under Assad, political activists were picked up and arrested there. Rumour had it that some waiters were regime informants.\nToday, it's a very different picture. The caf\u00e9 hosts talks and music plays. Prominent figures who once fled the country have returned too \u2013 many are greeted by a band playing traditional songs with a giant drum.\nSyrian journalist Mohammad Ghannam is one of them. He tells me that he spent months in prisons during Assad's regime and later moved to France; his euphoria at returning is palpable.\n\"I think everyone who can come back, should come back to rebuild the country,\" he declares. \"There is a window to do whatever you want now compared with before 8 December 2024.\"\nReflecting on the past, he adds: \"Even preachers in the mosques needed to get approval and know what they were going to preach. [Now] it's completely free. [At] Friday prayers the Imam was talking about how your personal freedom shouldn't step on other people's freedom.\"\nOdai al-Zobi has also recently returned to Syria after 14 years  \u2013 he left to study but says he was unable to come back before now because he was outspoken about the regime.\n\"My books were banned here,\" he tells me. \"Now there is no censorship, you can read whatever you want. I was very surprised that a lot of people want to read and want to know more.\"\n\"This is a big change,\" agrees Ali al-Atassi, a Syrian documentary-maker and son of former Syrian President Noureddine al-Atassi. (His father was deposed in a coup by Hafez al-Assad.)\n\"It changed the rules of the game, and opened a lot of perspectives for the country.\"\nSyria's vibrant arts and culture scene has long been a source of the country's pride: the Assads supported it, wanting to present a rich culture to the world yet some artists and writers were killed for their views on the regime.\nEven carrying certain books was once cause for arrest. Today, however, all kinds of books are on display in shops around the capital - even political titles. Cinema clubs screen films that were previously banned too.\nFor weeks after Assad's fall, the caretaker government didn't appoint a Minister of Culture, but musicians and artists grouped together to protect the culture scene. \nNow, however, there are fresh concerns: while Syria under Assad saw political debates repressed, some worry that repression by clerics could end up forbidding some forms of art seen as anti-religious.\nThere is no clear evidence of this. Dr Maher Al Sharaa, the brother of the interim president, has been seen at the city's Opera House with his family; Vivaldi was played by Syrian musicians. The family looked like any modern one who would go on a weekend for theatre.\nAnd after the fall of Assad, a cultural event with talks about cinema, music, theatre and performances was held at Beit Farhi, a historic house in the heart of Damascus's Jewish quarter. An all-female orchestra played songs that praised revolutions and martyrs. Some in the audience were left in tears.\n\"It is great to have this opportunity to talk among us about how to protect and support the art scene in Syria,\" says Noura Murad, a choreographer.\nMr al-Atassi also chooses to be optimistic. \"I believe the Syrians won't allow this regime to enter in their private lives, to create rules on how to behave in the public space.\"\nWhen Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad, was appointed by a military council on 29 January, he delivered a speech in which he stressed that the priority was to \"fill the power vacuum in a legitimate and legal way\".\nBut months on, there is concern among some around the likelihood of building a lasting democracy. And there is no system in place to hold officials, including the president, accountable until a permanent constitution is adopted and elections are held.\n\"The past few months, the regime has not been ready to share power and allow other political and social forces to find their place in society,\" argues Mr Al-Atassi. \"Without opening up the political arena to other forces, I don't think Sharaa can bring Syria back to the international community.\"\nIn February, hundreds gathered at the People's Palace in Damascus for a two-day national dialogue about Syria's future. Some critics argued that the meeting was organised in haste and was too short to cover all the key topics.\nAccording to Abdulhay Sayed, a Syrian legal expert and managing partner at Sayed and Sayed law firm, it was neither representative nor truly reflective of consensus.\n\"Large segments of Syrian society felt excluded or unrepresented,\" he argues. \"[It] was conceived as a mechanism to simulate wider assent.\"\nHowever, he concedes: \"It does reflect a certain willingness on the part of the new authorities to expand the scope of consultation.\"\nSharaa, who was leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the former al-Qaeda affiliate and Islamist group that dominated the rebel alliance, has clearly stated his commitment to establishing a country with \"free and impartial elections\".\nHe has also appointed a committee to work on a constitutional declaration, which laid out Syria's future over a five-year transitional period. However, the subsequent declaration didn't enshrine the separation of powers.\n\"He needs to show that he's more serious about political participation from all groups,\" says Mr Al-Atassi.\nThere are some examples of this: a Christian female minister was appointed minister for social affairs, while head of the White Helmet civil defence group, became minister of emergencies and disasters. But some have raised questions about the appointment of Sharaa's brother as head of presidential affairs.\n\"High-ranking former HTS members now occupy key sovereign positions,\" adds Mr Sayed.\nMr Al-Atassi also claims that \"highly qualified people in international law were not asked to participate in the Cabinet. They were overlooked.\"\nThe Minister of Justice holds a degree in Sharia law (Islam's legal system, derived from the Quran), and is not an expert on Syria's Civil Code, which draws heavily on French and Ottoman law. One question being asked is whether codes based on Sharia law could be applied rather than civil ones.\n\"The new authorities have so far made no attempt to replace the existing legal codes with Sharia-inspired legislation,\" says Mr Sayed. However, he adds, \"this remains an area we continue to monitor closely.\n\"The most pressing concern is whether judicial independence will be restored and effectively safeguarded. This represents a major challenge.\n\"There is little indication that the new authorities are genuinely committed to re-establishing an independent judiciary.\"\n\nUnder Assad's regime, women had relatively equal rights and had been represented in parliament since the 1950s, as well as being present in society at all levels. There are no new written rules that might point to how that could change \u2013 but there are some worrying signs.\nOnly one woman was appointed in the interim government. According to research by University College London and McGill University, women's rights advocates have raised concerns over HTS enforcing an interpretation of Islamic law, which could for example severely restrict women's mobility, dress and public participation.\n\"One important area to watch is whether women judges \u2013 who make up approximately 35 to 40 per cent of the judiciary \u2013 will face marginalisation or dismissal,\" says Mr Sayed. \"So far, we have seen no signs of such a trend, but continued vigilance is essential.\"\nAs for religious freedoms, there have been no new laws or rulings restricting social life, but some Syrians report that they have seen what appear to be attempts to enforce Islamic rule.\nThe Ministry of Justice has begun separating entry for men and women, plus there have been reports of men distributing flyers on buses and in Umayyad Mosque in Damascus asking women to wear full-faced veils.\nIn Christian neighbourhoods in the capital, cars have been filmed driving through the streets with preachers advocating for Islam over loudspeakers. An order to shut down bars and restaurants in the old city's Christian quarter was only revoked after a public outcry.\nSome observers of Islam tell me they are worried. Damascus is known for its tolerance but there are fears in some quarters that the new authorities have a Salafi background (a strict, orthodox Sunni Muslim sect). \n\"There is an increasing call for a return to religious values,\" says Mr Sayed. \"This presents a profound challenge for those who still believe in democracy, the rule of law, and equal citizenship.\"\nHowever Husam Jazmati, a Syrian academic who researches Islamic movements at the civil society research organisation Impact, claims that Sharaa \"opposes both Islamist and non-Islamist political movements [and] neither wants to establish an Islamic state nor believes it's possible.\n\"They don't want to, and they can't\".\nEven if the government wanted to instil hardline practices, the question is whether they could? Alaa El Din Al Sayyek, an imam based in Damascus, thinks not. He argues that Syrians would reject any attempt to do so.\n\"It is impossible, our society will not accept it,\" he tells me. \"We have lived in harmony with different sects for years even during difficult times. The Quran says it clearly: no compulsion in religion.\"\nToday there are growing tensions: violence in coastal cities has left more than 1,400 people dead, many of them Alawites (part of Assad's minority sect). They were said to be revenge for attacks on Syrian security forces.\nElsewhere, in the north east of the country, even though the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in 2019, camps still hold about 56,000 people, many of them the family members of Islamic State group (IS) suspects, more than five years after the jihadists' territorial defeat in Syria.\nThe main question now facing the country, however, is how Syrians see their future. There are some tensions around this, which have seeped into a push-pull between the leadership and HTS, according to Mr Jazmati. \nHe claims that while Sharaa's top circle wants to build \"a conservative, economically liberal\" state, \"they can't stop many of their members \u2013 those they've appointed in various positions and rely on because they're trusted \u2013 from trying to Islamise public life in Syria.\"\nThe think tank International Crisis Group has similar concerns. It has said that it believes Syria is living \"on borrowed time\".\n\"The interim government is running out of funds, security forces are overstretched, poverty is deepening and insurgency is brewing at the periphery. Outsiders are meddling. Western sanctions deprive leaders of what they need to rebuild, while preventing fragmentation or a return to civil war.\"\nFor Mr Al-Atassi, the solution is straightforward: He believes Sharaa needs to open up the political arena. \"There are no elections today in Syria, there are only nominations,\" he says. \"This is very dangerous.\"\nWith a pause, he adds: \"It could be that a new dictatorship is in the making - but I don't believe that the Syrian people are ready, after five decades, to accept a new dictatorship.\"\nAnd as for the prospect of lasting democracy? \"We need to wait to see,\" he says. \"But I'm not at all optimistic.\"\nHowever there is a wider issue too. That is, could there be a wider loss of faith in the very idea of democracy given the country's recent history? \nMr Sayed thinks so. \"Though the Assad-era constitutions formally proclaimed political freedoms\u2026 our experience of political modernity came in the form of shells falling on our heads, while our bodies were laid bare in detention camps,\" he tells me.\n\"Large segments of the Syrian population have lost faith in the promises of political modernity.\"\nOf the many challenges facing the new leadership, perhaps it is this that they would be wise to address first as they continue to carve out a new path for the future of Syria.\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

His family and attorneys have fiercely denied he is a member of MS-13. \nChris Van Hollen said he was initially blocked from meeting Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by Salvadoran authorities. Later, he said government officials helped facilitate a meeting and Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was brought to the senator's hotel.\n\"His conversation with me was the first communication that he had with anybody outside of prison since he was abducted,\" Van Hollen said.\n\"He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes.\"\nVan Hollen added that conditions in the new prison, in the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana, were better.\n\"He still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world,\" Van Hollen said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's case is part of a simmering showdown between the Trump administration and the US courts system on the issue of immigration. \nA separate feud has been brewing after a judge said he could hold the Trump administration in contempt for its \"wilful disregard\" of his order barring deportation flights. \nMultiple judges - including a unanimous US Supreme Court ruling - said the government should facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return to the US.

His wife said he \"worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites\". \nAt the heart of the case, though, are the allegations of his involvement in MS-13, which the Trump administration used to expel him under the Alien Enemies Act.\nThe president has evoked the law to deport hundreds so far, by arguing the alleged gang members were terrorists. \nSen Van Hollen said the Trump administration wants to \"flat out lie about what this case is about\". \n\"If you want to make claims about \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, you should present them in the courts, not on social media,\" he said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was arrested by immigration authorities on 12 March in Baltimore, before being deported from Texas to El Salvador on 15 March.

        "article_text": "It may be set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but Tony Gilroy's Star Wars series takes a key plot from a real robbery masterminded by Stalin in an Imperial Russian city. And Andor has as much to do with our world as it has with Stalin's.\nIt has all the makings of the perfect heist.\nThe scheme takes place far from the imperial seat of power, on the wild fringes of an empire almost too vast to comprehend. Fuelled with revolutionary zeal, the plotters are a rag-tag outfit of men and women that includes thieves, murderers and turncoats. Their prize? A treasure chest of cash that can fund ever-more-ambitious missions against the hated ruling elite.\nIf you watched the first season of the Star Wars spin-off TV series Andor, you'll recognise this plot as one of the high points. Over three episodes, anti-hero Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and his band of accomplices hide out in mountain passes on the planet Aldhani, fine-tuning an audacious smash-and-grab from an Imperial garrison which is storing the wages of an entire sector.\u00a0\nThe real-life theft that inspired it was also a long, long time ago, just not quite so far away.\nIt took place in Yerevan Square in what was then the imperial Russian city of Tiflis, now the Georgian capital Tblisi, on 26 June 1907. A shipment of cash for the city's Russian state bank branch, amounting to some 300,000 roubles ($1m at the time), was stolen by a gang of robbers linked to the Bolshevik revolutionary movement. Using bombs and guns, the gang left a scene of utter devastation in their wake; some 40 people were killed and dozens more injured. The news of the brazen daylight attack made headlines across the world.\nThe heist was the brainchild of a charismatic cobbler's son-turned-revolutionary called Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili. He was a gifted public speaker, an ex-seminary student, a romantic poet rumoured to have left a string of broken hearts in his rakish wake. He often went by the name \"Soso\" (which he had used when writing poems for local publications), though in years to come he would become far better-known \u2013 and feared \u2013 as Joseph Stalin.\u00a0\nYes, the troubled outlaw beloved by Star Wars fans everywhere is based in part on one of history\u2019s most notorious mass murderers, as the series' creator, Tony Gilroy, has acknowledged. \"If you look at a picture of young Stalin, isn\u2019t he glamorous,\" Gilroy said in an interview in\u00a0Rolling Stone in 2022. \"He looks like Diego!\"\nStalin took Russia from its war-ravaged imperial decline to a nuclear-armed superpower in just three decades, but also presided over a reign of authoritarian terror that starved, executed or imprisoned millions of its own citizens. Countless books had been written on his cruel years in power, but very little on his early years. Writer Simon Sebag Montefiore saw a gap, and began rifling through archives in post-Soviet countries to try and separate the truth from myth, and tell the little-known story of Stalin's early life.\nIn 2007 \u2013 a century after the infamous heist in Tiflis \u2013 Young Stalin was published. It delved into the early life of the Soviet Union's dictatorial leader. \"Should the life of a black-hearted ogre, a mass murderer who was the wickedest of the 20th-Century's monsters, be quite so entertaining,\" asked a review in The Observer at the time.\nOne person who read Young Stalin was Gilroy. The writer and producer, who had scripted the first four Bourne films and the Andor-precursor film, Rogue One, was planning a TV series that would explore Cassian Andor's journey from casual thief to rebellious figurehead. The true story of a revolutionary movement on the far fringes of a real empire gave Gilroy his source material. \"Literally, I\u2019m the classic old white guy who just can\u2019t get enough history,\" Gilroy said in Rolling Stone. \"The last 15 years, I\u2019ve been reading all non-fiction.\" He added that Young Stalin was \"an amazing book\" and that its account of the Tiflis bank robbery was an \"incredible movie sequence\".\nDid Sebag Montefiore ever think to himself, 'Here's the perfect setting for a Star Wars spin-off,' when he was researching his book? \"No, I didn't ever think that when I was toiling in the archives in Moscow and Tbilisi,\" he tells the BBC. \"But I did think that there was something pretty elemental about the life of Stalin, especially before 1917. It was a fascinating story, partly because no one knew about it.\"\nThe Tiflis heist was reported around the world and funded the revolutionaries' movement for years, says Sebag Montefiore. \"Lenin and the whole Bolshevik Party lived off that money until the [1917] revolution.\"\nSebag Montefiore says that the young Stalin and the troubled Andor bear striking similarities: \"A young man from nowhere with a revolutionary ideology, and a fight against a huge empire,\" the writer says. \"I did think there was something interesting about the secret life of someone in that situation. That's basically what Tony Gilroy has focused on in Andor.\"\nStalin was, of course, not the only figure fomenting turmoil in Tsarist Russia, and Andor fleshes out other characters with attributes from the young Georgian's contemporaries. Among Andor's co-conspirators in the Aldanhi heist is Karis Nemik (Alex Lawther), an idealist writing a high-minded manifesto for the emerging resistance, similar to Bolshevik Leon Trotsky's polemics amid the opulent decline of Romanov rule.\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's character, Luthen Rael, is an analogue for Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader who was able to form a powerful movement from unlikely bedfellows. A wealthy art collector, Luthen's precise manners in front of his gilded customers hide an uncompromising hatred of the empire and a restless desire to fund a growing resistance. In Cassian's talented, taciturn thief he sees a useful tool; Lenin saw the same in Stalin. \"In 1911, people said to Lenin, 'Why are you using this guy? He's a gangster. He's had people killed. He was involved in all these bank robberies,'\" says Sebag Montefiore. \"And Lenin replies, 'He's exactly the type we need.' Stalin could edit a paper. He could write and could read. And he was also someone who could arrange a hit on somebody and arrange a bank robbery. That was what Lenin talked about: some people were tea drinkers, and other people were thugs, Stalin could do both, and that's why Stalin won in the end.\"\u00a0\nThe research into historical rebellions \u2013 Gilroy has said he studied other revolutions while writing Andor, as well \u2013 has no doubt helped create the show's oddly realistic feel. Andor feels more down to earth than anything the Star Wars universe has shown us before, if you'll excuse the occasional spaceship roaring overhead, or an alien or two sitting in the local bar. There are flashes of mundane detail rarely scene in big-budget sci-fi. People complain that Andor's mother Maarva's (Fiona Shaw) house is always too cold. Security officer Syril Karn's (Kyle Soller) petulant intensity even extends to tailoring his uniform to make him look smarter than his contemporaries. The Imperial Security Bureau hoping to root out the emerging rebellion is a nest of competing ambitions that feels as real as anything in a historical drama \u2013 or in everyday office politik. There are fewer blaster-toting Stormtroopers than there are in the Star Wars films, and more sadistic, trenchcoated officers who would have been right at home in the Tsarist secret police, the Okhrana, or its Soviet replacement, the Cheka.\n\"In the past, Star Wars movies drop us in at a very big moment,\" says Walter Marsh, an Australian writer who praised Andor's grown-up worldview in The Guardian in 2022. \"There's the big climactic battle, or Luke Skywalker's heroic journey, and they're these big themes of good versus evil. But as any historian will tell you, wars and empires and revolutions don't start and end overnight, and there's always this bigger backstory. There's this sort of long tail. It takes years for that kind of colonial rot, those systems of control, to set in.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Japanese film that Star Wars stole from\n\u2022 The truth about Henry VIII's right-hand man\n\u2022 Black Mirror's most 'devastating' episode ever\nAndor shows the corruption and brutal entitlement found at every layer of autocratic regimes: the guards drinking in a brothel while they're supposed to be on duty (and prepared to shake down anyone they don't like the look of); the prison industrial system that requires constant additions even if the new prisoners have done nothing wrong; the subtle sabotage of ethnic pilgrimages to sacred land that is earmarked for imperial development. And with authoritarianism on the rise around the globe, Andor has as much to say about today's world as it does about Stalin's.\u00a0\n\"When the show came out I think I was pleasantly surprised to see a story in that universe that was familiar, but which also approached this question of empire that's been so central to the whole franchise, but was never actually tackled in a really nuanced and human character-driven way,\" Marsh tells the BBC. \"It's all well and good to have a big, evil Sith Lord achieve global, universal domination. But how does power assert itself on the street level, from one human to another?\n\"The Empire is this huge grinding, unthinking machine, but it's also a very human thing,\" Marsh continues. \"Who are the people that find a place and thrive in those systems?\" He remarks that in the original films the Imperials were little more than blank-and-you-miss-them pantomime villains: \"British guys in suits getting choked by Darth Vader at some point, who are just fiddling with buttons in the background.\"\nAndor's strength is its \"three-episode arcs that showed us the kind of death by a thousand cuts that it takes to achieve this sort of social, political and economic dominance\", says Marsh. \"The converse of that is it shows all the ways in which that kind of oppression inspires pushback and resistance in all kinds of different ways.\"\nThe new season, which begins on Tuesday 22 April, will develop the rebellion's story as it rushes towards the events seen in Rogue One: the scenes of brutal Imperial reactions to a demonstration shown in the trailer evoke the Tsarist crackdown on a St Petersburg march in 1905, which was a\u00a0 slow-burning contributor to the Bolshevik revolution.\n\"The scavenger who becomes a passionate revolutionary leader is kind of fascinating,\" says Sebag Montefiore of the troubled Cassian Andor. \"That's a great trajectory, because that's exactly what Stalin did. And it'll be interesting to see how deep Gilroy uses that \u2013 how far he goes to create a character with both heroic and villainous features.\"\nGeorge Lucas's original film trilogy rooted the rebellion in the classic good-guys-versus-bad-guys dynamic of countless Saturday matinee cliffhangers, the resistance modelled after anti-Nazi opposition in occupied Europe. The rebels of Andor inhabit a much more compromised reality; like real-life revolutionary movements, they are much more complicated than the ones we usually see on screen. Luthen, Andor's Lenin proxy, considers it with chilling deliberation in one of the first season's standout scenes: \"I'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else's future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I\u2019ll never see.\"\nAs Sebag Montefiore notes, the revolutionaries themselves knew deep down that if they took power, they themselves would have to use repression as a tool; they would become what they once despised. \"Lenin himself said: 'A revolution without firing squads is meaningless.'\"\u00a0\nAndor season two is available on Disney+ from 22 April.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "In a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it \u2013 and that's what makes it magical.\nIn the Sandhills region of North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.\nThe region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.\nPeople largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm \u2013 think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.\nThe prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the \"cradle of American golf\", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.\nHunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and \u2013 the star attraction \u2013 imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nBut travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.\n\"It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,\" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.\nBurns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.\nDon Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (\u00a313) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about \u00a358) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.\nPlan your trip\n- If you\u2019re looking to purchase your own jar of amethyst treasure, keep an eye out online for availability toward late July. Dees Bees Apiary tends to sell in smaller increments so more people have the chance to try it.\n- At other times of year, drop into local shops and farmers' markets to taste the distinct honey varieties grown here, from sourwood to apple blossom to tupelo, and if you\u2019re lucky, some of the purple stuff, too.\n- Visitors can also take a honey tour with Honeybee Bliss, where suited-up guests play honey sommelier and take a turn at pulling bee-laden frames oozing with golden goo.\nDees' take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.\nHowever, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, \"to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way\".\nBurns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. \"One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it.\" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. \"Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.\nThere's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers \u2013 who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff \u2013 can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets \u2013 and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions.

This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

I think I was 3-0 up and then I didn't pot a ball for three or four frames. Some of the balls he potted were incredible,\" Williams told BBC Sport. \n\"He's got the potential to win this tournament, there's absolutely no question. His long-potting was unbelievable and I just had to go back to my old break-off because every single time he potted a long red.\n\"I thought that I had to do something because I can't outscore him or outpot him, but I could still try to outwit him I suppose.

Article 2 said the sides \"respect each other's territorial integrity and confirm the inviolability of existing borders between them\".\nThe war has been rife with accusations of treachery from the very beginning. \nGen Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of Ukraine's General Staff at the time, accuses Russia of going back on agreements allowing Ukrainian troops to pull out from the eastern town of Ilovaysk in August 2014. \nAs a result, withdrawing convoys came under fire, and at least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed.\nThe first major ceasefire agreement, signed on 5 September 2014 in Minsk, was broken within hours of being signed, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport. Attacks on other Ukrainian towns in the region, such as Debaltseve, continued, too.\nThis prompted the second attempted truce, known as Minsk-2, but it was even shorter. \nWithin minutes of it going into effect on 15 February 2015, observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported mortar and artillery fire in Donetsk. They were deployed to the war zone at Ukraine's request to monitor the security situation including any ceasefire violations, but they did not explicitly say who committed them.\nWhat followed was a string of other failed ceasefire attempts. Again, some were broken within minutes of coming into force.\nThey included Easter truces in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the \"school ceasefires\" of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 which were meant to allow schoolchildren near the frontline to go back to school in September, Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the \"bread ceasefires\" of 2017, 2018 and 2019 to allow the harvesting of grain, and others.\nA \"comprehensive ceasefire\" that went into effect on 27 July 2020 only lasted 20 minutes, according to Kyiv. Still, it had an effect on the fighting, halving the number of fatalities among Ukrainian soldiers in the following year.\nMatthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, argues that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith.\n\"Russia has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives,\" he says.\nBecause of various ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and Russia, \"the level of fighting has ebbed and flowed, and Ukraine bears some responsibility for part of that\", he tells the BBC. \n\"But the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat, and that informs things.\"\nJohn Herbst, a former US ambassador to Kyiv who now works for the Washington-based think-tank Atlantic Council, argues that Russia, not Ukraine was the \"serial violator\" of the Minsk ceasefire accords, the first and still one of the most comprehensive attempts to broker a truce in Ukraine.\nVerifying claims of ceasefire violations is not easy because almost all independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.\nBBC journalist Olga Ivshina, who was on the ground in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region reporting about the earlier stages of the war, says there were reports of Ukraine retaking villages in 2016-19, a successful Ukrainian offensive outside Mariupol, and Ukrainian tanks were spotted too close to the frontline, where they should not have been under the ceasefire deals.\n\"All of these were proclaimed as violations by Moscow. But of course they forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all,\" Ivshina says. \nDespite the Minsk accords, Russian-controlled forces launched an offensive against the town of Debaltseve, claiming that it was not covered by the ceasefire deal.\nZelensky has described the Minsk accords as a \"trap\" for Ukraine which allowed Russia to prepare for the full-scale invasion. \nPutin says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers had intended to implement the Minsk deals. Their fate was sealed when Russia declared the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" - separatist entities it had helped to set up - as independent states.\nPutin's \"Easter truce\" was never more than a lull, but President Trump said \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\".\nSo far there has been no indication that the Kremlin will accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, agreed to by Ukraine. \nTrump has already warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, \"we're just gonna take a pass\" and walk away.\nRussia's demand for \"the underlying causes of the conflict\" to be resolved suggest it has not moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty - through negotiations as well as military means.\nVladislav Surkov, a former close adviser to Vladimir Putin who was known as the \"grey cardinal\" of Russian politics, celebrates the Minsk accords last year as a way of \"legitimising\" Ukraine's initial partition.\nThe very idea of peace, he said, wass \"nothing but a continuation of war by other means\".",

        "article_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of creating an \"impression\" of a ceasefire while still taking military actions in some places in Ukraine.\nIn the first six hours of the \"Easter truce\" - as ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin - Zelensky said there had been 387 shellings and 19 assaults by Russian forces, and drones used 290 times. There are no reports of casualties.\nPutin ordered his forces to \"stop all military activity\" in Ukraine from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday. Kyiv said it would also adhere.\nRussia's defence ministry insisted all Russian forces had been adhering to the truce and accused Ukraine's army of breaking it.\nRussia said Ukrainian units fired at the positions of Russian troops 444 times, carried out 900 strikes with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), 12 shellings, 33 strikes by UAVs and seven drops of munitions. The ministry said there were dead and wounded among the civilian population. It did not give any details.\nZelensky on Sunday morning said Moscow was \"trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine.\"\nAccusing Russia of specific military actions, Zelensky added that \"everywhere our warriors are responding as the enemy deserves, based on the specific combat situation.\"\nBecause Putin's ceasefire was announced minutes before it was due to take effect, an immediate, complete pause was always unlikely, but the BBC in Ukraine reports it has been quieter on the front lines.\nBefore Zelensky said there had been continued attacks in some areas, at midnight on Saturday there were no reported Russian drones or fighter jets in Ukrainian skies. \nThat is very rare.\nThe only report was that a Russian ship with missile launchers had been deployed to the Black Sea. \nIn the southern city of Odesa, it was silent. On Friday, before Moscow's announcement, air defences crackled throughout the night as Russian drones flew in from the direction of occupied Crimea.\nLate on Saturday - hours into the truce - Zelensky had said: \"If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russia's actions.\" \n\"Our actions are and will be symmetrical. The proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table \u2014 the answer to it must come from Moscow,\" he wrote on X. \nZelensky said Ukraine would be ready to extend a truce beyond 20 April, seemingly referring to an earlier proposal from the US for a 30-day ceasefire which Ukraine had already agreed to. \nIt seems now both Moscow and Kyiv want to show Washington they are serious about peace. The question of whether the Kremlin accepts Zelensky's offer to turn this truce from a 30-hour one to a 30 day one is central to any potential path to peace.\nFew Ukrainians think that is remotely possible.\nPutin had announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov.\n\"Based on humanitarian considerations... the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period,\" Putin told Gerasimov.\n\"We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.\"\nThe Russian defence ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was \"mutually respected\" by Ukraine.\nIt is not the first time a pause in fighting has been suddenly announced - a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 fell apart after both sides failed to agree on a proposal. \nReacting to the recent truce announcement, a UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for - not just a one day pause for Easter.\"\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides. \nThe US has been directly talking to Russia as part of its efforts to end the war, but has struggled to make major progress. \nLast month, Moscow came up with a long list of conditions in response to a full and unconditional ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine.\nUS President Donald Trump on Friday warned Washington would \"take a pass\" on brokering further talks on ending the war in Ukraine unless there was quick progress.\nHe was speaking after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not \"going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end\", as it had \"other priorities to focus on\".\n\"We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable,\" he added. \n\"If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on.\"",

        "article_text": "It was once the Indian start-up world's shining star, but Ola is now battling a multitude of crises.\nFounded in 2010, it quickly became a household name, expanding from ride-hailing to electric vehicles and battery cells, challenging Uber along the way.\nThe company jumped on the AI bandwagon in 2023 with Krutrim, India's first AI company valued at over $1bn.\nMarquee global investors such as Japan's SoftBank, US-based Tiger Global and Singapore's Temasek bankrolled this expansion. Last year, Ola's electric vehicles (EV) arm raised close to $734m (\u00a3567m) in a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO), India's biggest in 2024. \nBut this ambitious rise has been accompanied by a series of controversies lately, particularly at its EV arm.\nOla Electric has lost close to 70% of its value in the seven months since the IPO was launched. It is facing competition from more established two-wheeler giants, along with mounting regulatory scrutiny.\nSales of Ola's scooters are down to less than half from April last year and the company's losses have widened. Customers have posted videos on social media of Ola scooters going up in flames or breaking down mid-ride.\nThere's a government inquiry under way at hundreds of newly-opened Ola showrooms regarding licences and registrations. One of its vendors also filed an insolvency plea against the company, which Ola said in a statement to stock exchanges that it had settled.\nThe BBC has learnt from former employees and industry sources that delayed payments have led to many major suppliers and logistics partners ending ties with them.\nOla has been cutting jobs, restructuring operations and automating functions in a bid to reduce costs and trim losses. Media reports say it has undertaken a second round of layoffs since November, with over 1,000 roles axed.\nThe BBC sent detailed questions to Ola about these issues. The company shared links to some of its earlier press statements, not responding specifically to all the queries.\nSo, what's gone wrong?\nOla CEO Bhavish Aggarwal positioned the company as Tesla's two-wheeler equivalent, solving the emissions problem for the price-sensitive Indian market.\nHe poured in millions of marketing dollars, opening Ola showrooms across India, even delivering scooters at the doorstep of people who'd made online bookings.\nBut Ola has struggled to read the market well, says Rohit Paradkar, an analyst with the auto magazine Overdrive. \nIts scooter is modelled on the AppScooter from Etergo, a Dutch start-up that Ola Electric acquired in 2020. \nSeveral former employees told the BBC that Ola's first EV scooter was launched without many changes to Etergo's version. A former employee who worked in the compliance department told the BBC that clearances were rushed through to meet unrealistic launch deadlines. \nIn response to queries, Ola referred to an October 2023 blog post where it addressed the \"myth\" that the vehicle had \"not been engineered and tested for India\". It said it had \"fully re-engineered\" Etergo's scooter and tested it for \"Indian conditions\". \n\"The whole vehicle has been tested at three levels [for India] - digital simulations, component tests and vehicular lab tests, and vehicular field tests,\" it said in the post.\nBut several safety-related incidents reported by customers have raised questions.\nSome scooters began catching fire which, auto experts say, was likely due to short-circuits or faulty battery management system. \nOla recalled more than 1,400 first-generation scooters in 2022 to investigate the fires, but the report was not publicly released. It had then said the battery systems were compliant for Indian and European standards but didn't explain what caused the fires.\nSome riders also reported the front suspension - which holds the wheel in place - breaking mid-ride, causing injuries. \nIn early 2023, after such an accident, Ola called it a rare case, noting there were only a few such issues among 150,000 scooters. \nThe front fork arm, they said, had a significant safety margin for accidents and was designed to handle 80% more load than what it would typically experience during daily use.\nMeanwhile, Ola's rivals - mostly established automakers - have rolled out electric scooters smoothly, adding to the pressure on the company.\nTheir entry shook the market. Ola's share had plunged from 52% to 19% by December, then recovered to 25% in January. \nOla aims to sell 50,000 units monthly to turn profitable, but analysts doubt the target, despite the company saying recent restructuring has helped it achieve $10m monthly savings and faster deliveries.\nGovernment data shows that less than 10,000 scooters were sold in February, but Ola claims 25,000, blaming registration delays due to vendor contract changes. The federal transport ministry has issued notices over the discrepancy. Ola said it had registered over 23,000 scooters sold in March and held a 30% market share for the fiscal year.\nBut competing scooters with fewer features are now outselling Ola simply because they come from trusted, well-established brands, said Jay Kale, executive vice-president and auto analyst at Elara Capital.\nTo push sales, Ola has offered deep discounts, launching newer models at cheaper price points. But losses have widened to $65m in the October-December quarter from $43.6m a year ago.\nBesides product issues, the reliability of its customer service has been another major issue, says Kale.\nWhen angry customers flooded social media and consumer helplines with complaints about the fires and front suspension, their service requests were reportedly unanswered for days.\nAt one point, thousands of complaints were piling up monthly, a former employee at Ola told the BBC. India's consumer rights agency, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), also sent a notice to Ola after it got 10,000 complaints over the period of a year.\nBut since Ola had eschewed the established dealer route in a bid to sell directly to buyers and had just a few service centres, aggrieved consumers had few places to turn to.\nLate last year, Ola wrote to the CCPA that it had a \"robust mechanism to address complaints\", and that most raised with the regulator had been satisfactorily resolved.\nAggarwal was initially dismissive of the problems on social media but later announced that Ola would be opening nearly 4,000 stores with service facilities, following a heated public exchange on X with a stand-up comedian who took up the customers' cause.\nA majority of these new centres, however, came under the government's scanner for lacking relevant licences to store and sell vehicles.\nOn 21 March, Ola confirmed investigations in four states and said it was responding to authorities.\nThe sharp turn in Ola's fortunes is making investors - especially those who bought in at high IPO valuations - nervous.\nOla has been a key player in India's push to cut carbon emissions and expand manufacturing.\nIt benefits from two separate state subsidies, one to make scooters and the second to set up its own 20 gigawatt EV battery plant. But Reuters has reported that the costly gigafactory project is delayed and has missed a key milestone, potentially leading to penalties.\nCritics say Ola's troubles emanate from typical culture issues that plague many start-ups - including CEO-driven decision-making, constant pivots and unrealistic, high-pressure deadlines.\n\"Software mindsets don't work with hardware products, which need time to build,\" said Deepesh Rathore, who used to head product strategy at Ola Electric and now runs consultancy firm Insight EV.\nSome top executives across the wider company have quit recently, including a former Ola Cab CEO who quit within months. Key leaders in tech, marketing, sales and business also left last year. \nExperts say the exits have also affected Ola's efforts to fix product and service issues.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

Victories at the British Open and Welsh Open have importantly restored the confidence of one of the game's greats.Selby comes into the tournament in the sort of form that indicates he could add to his four world titles, with thumping wins over Neil Robertson and Ding Junhui at the Tour Championship earlier this month.Having already lifted one Triple Crown trophy this term at the Masters, the 2005 winner Shaun Murphy will fancy his chances too.Meanwhile, Australia's Robertson, who won the world crown in 2010, will hope to go deep after failing to qualify 12 months ago, and Northern Ireland's Mark Allen comes in under the radar in his quest for a first Crucible title.The Chinese challenge?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, A record 10 Chinese players are appearing at the CrucibleFour consecutive first-round exits at the Crucible certainly do not bode well for world number 10 Ding Junhui's chances.Yet China's hopes of a having a first world champion far from rest on the 38-year-old's shoulders.He is just one of a record 10 Chinese players at the tournament with Zhang Anda, Xiao Guodong and Si Jiahui seeded, and Zhao Xintong, Zhou Yuelong, Fan Zhengyi, Pang Junxu, Lei Peifan and Wu Yize coming through qualifying.

The strikes came one after the other, then everything was on fire,\" one man who said he worked there told the channel.\nOn Thursday afternoon, Houthi health ministry spokesman Anees al-Asbahi said the death toll had reached 74, adding that rescue teams were still searching for casualties.\nAl-Masirah had earlier cited local health authorities as saying many of the dead were workers at Ras Isa. It also reported that five paramedics were killed in secondary US strikes as they arrived at the scene.\nThe casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but graphic footage from Al-Masirah appeared to show at least 10 charred bodies near the burning tankers, including one driver, as well as men being treated for serious burns in hospital.\n\"We affirm that the targeting of the Ras Isa oil port is a full-fledged war crime, as the port is a civilian facility and not a military one,\" the Houthi-run government said in a statement.\n\"We hold the US administration fully responsible for the consequences resulting from its escalation in the Red Sea,\" it warned.\nThe US military's Central Command said in a statement that the \"objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen\".\n\"The Houthis, their Iranian masters, and those who knowingly aid and abet their terrorist actions should be put on notice that the world will not accept illicit smuggling of fuel and war material to a terrorist organisation,\" it added.\nIran's foreign ministry said it strongly condemned the strikes as \"barbaric\".\nOn Thursday, the Houthis' leader gave a defiant speech in which he claimed the recent US strikes failed to stop their attacks.\nAbdul Malik al-Houthi said the group's forces had carried out almost 80 operations involving around 170 missiles and drones since mid-March, including 30 attacks targeting the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman and 26 attacks on Israel.\nYemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated 10 years ago, when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.\nThe fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nThe Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nThe Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.\nAfter taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - something the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.\nLast month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be \"completely annihilated\". He has also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.\nHouthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians in recent weeks, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.\nEarlier this month, Trump posted a black-and-white video from an aircraft that showed a strike targeting about 70 people gathered in a circle whom he identified as Houthis. But the Houthi-run Saba news agency cited a source as saying it was \"a social Eid visit\" in Hudaydah province.\nIsrael has also carried out air strikes against the Houthis since last July in retaliation for the hundreds of missiles and drones that the Israeli military says have been launched at the country from Yemen, most of which have been shot down.",

        "article_text": "Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold planted his shirt on the corner flag after scoring his winner at Leicester\nThe sight of Trent Alexander-Arnold celebrating bare chested with arms outstretched, his red shirt hoisted on a corner flag at King Power Stadium, will become an iconic image of Liverpool's march to the Premier League title.\nAmid the wild elation that followed his late winner at relegated Leicester City, it left Liverpool's big questions still hanging in the air.\nWill Alexander-Arnold leave his home city club behind in pursuit of new glory with Real Madrid in Spain? Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated.

        "article_text": "Construction, alcohol and food sponsors are no longer visible on any Premier League shirts, while gambling is more common than ever\nThere was once a time when the shirts of English football's leading clubs were adorned with household brands - but those days are long gone.\nThe Premier League's prestige and global audience is bigger than ever - and lots of the companies who now sponsor shirts don't even operate in the UK, and aren't really even trying to sell anything to fans.\nSo how have shirts sponsorships in the Premier League changed over the decades, and why are gambling firms more prevalent?\nPremier League clubs' self-imposed ban on front-of-shirt gambling sponsors is set to come into effect before the 2026-27 season. But as things stand, 11 teams feature a gambling sponsor on the front of their shirts, an increase of three from last season.\nAccording to figures from GlobalData, the combined value of shirt sponsorship deals involving Premier League clubs and gambling companies in the 2024-25 season is $135.43m (\u00a3101.1m).\nThe other nine clubs are sponsored by companies from four industries - air travel, entertainment, financial services and technology.\nRewind three decades to the foundation of the Premier League and none of its 22 clubs had a shirt sponsorship deal with a gambling company.\nJust over half of the companies which sponsored teams in the 1992-93 campaign were headquartered in the UK, and the majority sold physical products in Britain.\nNowadays, none of the front-of-shirt sponsor companies are aiming to sell physical products that fans can buy directly, and only one is headquartered in the UK. Even that one, Liverpool partner bank Standard Chartered, does not allow UK customers to open a current account with it.\nIndustries such as technology, construction and clothing have almost completely disappeared from shirts.\nFive of the 1992-93 shirt sponsors - Commodore, Fisons, ICI, Mita Copiers and Tulip Computers - have since gone out of business.\nIn the inaugural Premier League season, seven Premier League shirt sponsors companies were based within 100 miles of their club. Of those, four were based within 10 miles, and two - Sheffield United and Ipswich - were located less than a mile away.\nNow, only one club - Liverpool - are based within 1,000 miles of their shirt sponsor's main base.\nThe average distance between a club and their shirt sponsor's main office in 1992-93 was 1,859 miles. Now it is 4,431 miles.\nGlobalisation and advances in technology have also played a role in shifting the dynamic of modern sponsorships - big business and wider influence is increasingly what sponsor companies are aiming for, rather than the cash from the pockets of the fans in the stands.\n\"In the UK there around 70 million people, but worldwide you're talking about a marketplace of billions,\" says Dr Joe Piggin, senior lecturer in sports management and policy at the University of Loughborough. \"So the economic incentives are there for the companies.\"\nAs the global financial picture has changed, companies in countries which enjoyed booming economies in the early 90s that have now weakened - such as Japan - have become less common shirt sponsors.\nMeanwhile, newer money in modern financial strongholds such as the Middle East is being spent on sponsorship deals.\nSponsor companies gain far more from partnerships with clubs than just advertising \u2013 access to private boxes can be used to host clients, photoshoots with superstar players can be used in corporate material, and relationships can in some cases be used for political leverage.\n\"The Premier League should look after itself,\" Piggin says. \"Not just in terms of the economic sustainability, but in terms of connecting with their local communities.\"\nThe Premier League itself does not have an official gambling partner, but Uefa announced its first formal gambling sponsor last summer.\nAccording to data from Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report, gambling firms are also the most common sponsors of top division clubs in Belgium, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Russia.\nThe top industries for shirt sponsorships across top divisions in Europe are:\nGambling (15%)\nRetail (12%)\nAir travel; automotive; financial services; food and drink (all 10%)\nIn the Championship, gambling is also the most popular category of shirt sponsor with six clubs - Burnley, Middlesbrough, QPR, Stoke, Sunderland, and Watford.\nThere are no gambling sponsors on shirts in League One and League Two. The most common industries in those divisions are energy, automotive, and food and drink.\nThree Scottish Premiership clubs - Celtic, Dundee United and Rangers - are sponsored by gambling firms.\nResearch shows that gambling advertisements were shown more than 29,000 times in the UK during the first weekend of this Premier League season, almost trebling the previous campaign's figure.\n\"Gambling advertising has become almost inextricably linked to football and the industry makes a concerted effort to target young men, which is the profile most likely to develop problems with gambling,\" says Matt Zarb-Cousin, co-founder of Gamban, software which aims to help users quit online gambling.\n\"There's a generation that's growing up in an environment that associates watching football with betting - they've been conditioned to believe it's a normal thing to do as part of enjoying sport.\"\nAccording to the UK Gambling Commission's latest figures, gambling firms earned revenue of \u00a315.1bn between April 2022 and March 2023. That income has given them plenty to spend on advertising. And even with the front-of-shirt ban looming, some believe they will move their advertising into other areas like pitchside hoardings and maybe even shirt sleeves.\n\"The front-of-shirt sponsorship withdrawal appears symbolic,\" Piggin says. \"I'm quite sceptical about the significance of that move beyond public relations.\nUnder-18s are not allowed to wear shirts with gambling sponsors - meaning young players have featured in games with sponsor-free jerseys.\nLeicester City's 15-year-old winger Jeremy Monga played wearing a shirt without the club's gambling sponsor on the front when he made his debut against Newcastle United earlier in April\nNone of the Premier League's six wealthiest clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur - feature a gambling firm on the front of their shirts.\nTargeting clubs lower down the league, who face a much higher threat of relegation and the potential economic insecurity that comes with that, is a way for gambling firms to associate themselves with the Premier League without having to fork out top-end sums.\n\"It is cheaper than sponsoring any of the top six,\" Piggin says. \"And they also get their brand on shirts in photos of these teams playing the top six anyway. So there would be that legitimacy of 'look, we're in the Premier League, who cares who we're sponsoring?'\"\nSome of the gambling sponsors are based in tax havens such as Curacao and Malta, allowing them to keep more of the profits they make from customers.\nUK customers are not even able to bet with some of the gambling companies which feature on the front of shirts. \nThese so-called 'white label' firms instead use sponsorship of Premier League clubs to target customers in other markets.\nThe gambling companies which sponsor Nottingham Forest and Wolves are among those targeting customers in Asia\nA lot of those companies are based in East Asia, and are aimed at customers in China, even though gambling is illegal there.\n\"There are ways around China's gambling ban using VPNs and so on,\" says Dr Raffaello Rossi, lecturer in marketing at the University of Bristol. \"They're advertising in the UK, not China, so the Chinese government can't do anything about it. But still they're reaching the Chinese population because the Premier League is a global phenomenon.\"\nThe fact that UK customers can't gamble with some of these companies doesn't necessarily mean the advertisement has zero impact on British spectators, however.\n\"It can still trigger someone to start betting because you recognise it's a betting sponsor,\" Rossi adds.",

But language barriers quickly pose a challenge.\nSo who's competing this year? The teams include sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, former married couple Yin and Gaz, and teenage couple Fin and Sioned.\nCompleting the line up, we have brothers Brian and Melvyn, and mother and son Caroline and Tom.\nRace Across the World is as much about its contestants as the race and travelling. I'm mostly excited for the inevitable moving moments, as we see the teams pushed to their absolute limits.\nBy Mark Savage, music correspondent\n\"This album is going to get terrible reviews,\" Self Esteem predicted when I caught up with her last Christmas.\nWhy? \"Because people hate women doing well,\" she laughed. \"I'm very ready for a male journalist to say it doesn't make sense, because it's a lot.\"\nThat's kind of the point, though. Out on Friday, A Complicated Woman is an attempt to capture womanhood in all its complexities and contradictions \u2013 and that means moving through musical genres, modes and attitudes with almost whiplash-inducing speed.\nBut Self Esteem, aka Rebecca Lucy Taylor, is too clever to mess it up. Her trademark wit and sincerity are firmly in place, as she talks candidly about social anxiety, crises of confidence, infantilised men, her least favourite sexual positions and being beaten down for speaking up.\nHighlights include The Curse, a stadium-sized ballad about using alcohol as an emotional crutch; and closing track The Deep Blue Okay, where she eventually finds a modicum of inner peace. Along the way, there are guest appearances from Nadine Shah, Moonchild Sanelly and even Coronation Street's Julie Hesmondhalgh.\nShe launched the album with a flashy West End residency last week \u2013 where fans were delighted to discover that A Complicated Woman was an uncomplicated delight.\nLuigi Mangione's case went viral after he was charged with killing healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in New York City in December.\nHe has pleaded not guilty to state charges, and has yet to enter a plea for separate federal charges.\nSome on social media have celebrated the 26-year-old, and shared anger at America's private health insurers.\nSo what are the facts, and what are the conspiracies?\nThe Mangione Trial, on BBC Sounds, aims to unpick this. The latest episode drops on Wednesday, and looks at how the US healthcare system works.\nIt hears from a mother who says she spent $40,000 (\u00a330,000) on her daughter's treatment while also battling for her insurance to cover it.\nFuture episodes will dive into what conspiracy theories are, and why people become so obsessed with them.\nBy Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter\nDark fantasy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, out Thursday for PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Game Pass, quite literally caught people's eyes when it was first revealed at last year's Summer Game Fest.\nAs video games go, it's a stunner, with gorgeous art direction heavily inspired by France's 19th century Belle \u00c9poque era.\nPlayers control a crew of characters on a quest to destroy the Paintress \u2013 a being who emerges once a year and scrawls a number onto a monolith. If someone's age matches the digits, they die (hence the 33 in the title).\nSomehow, the 30-person team at French developer Sandfall Interactive has also managed to attract some top-tier acting talent to the role-playing game (RPG) project, including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Gollum actor Andy Serkis, Final Fantasy XVI's Ben Starr and Baldur's Gate 3's Jennifer English.\nBut the thing that's arguably generated most excitement is the game's focus on old-school turn-based combat. It was a staple of classic 1990s and early 2000s RPG series such as Final Fantasy that's fallen out of fashion in the blockbuster space of late. If the studio sticks the landing with their debut title, expect to hear about Expedition 33 when Game of the Year season rolls around.\nIf that doesn't take your fancy, video game adaptation Until Dawn is out in cinemas on Friday. Passionate fans of the 2015 \"interactive horror movie\" were concerned when the first trailer revealed the film's makers had swapped the game's trademark choose-your-own-adventure device for a Happy Death Day-style time loop.\nBut with Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation director David F Sandberg and prolific horror writer Gary Dauberman on board, and a buzzy cast including Love, Victor star Michael Cimino and up-and-comer Ella Rubin, Until Dawn's fate isn't necessarily sealed yet.",

        "article_text": "A Guernsey headteacher has changed the school curriculum to include Artificial Intelligence (AI) because of its potential impact on the futures of students.\nDaniele Harford-Fox said The Ladies College used a custom-made AI agent to help Year 7 students set themselves targets.\nShe said staff also used an internal version of Microsoft Copilot with added restrictions to ensure safe learning.\n\"There are fundamental questions about whether [the education system] is going to still be relevant to this industrial revolution,\" she said.\nMs Harford-Fox said recent AI models, such as Chat GPT-4, were capable of writing work better than most A-level students and Guernsey teachers were concerned about verifying their work.\nShe said: \"If AI can write a better essay than most students, the real question is why are we spending seven years of a student's life teaching them how to write essays?\"\nThe States does not have a specific policy which covers AI use in schools, but its online safety guidance refers users to Guernsey's data protection laws. \n\nAs data protection rules are laws, and not States' guidelines, independent schools are also expected to follow them. \nHowever, States-maintained schools are also required to follow UK AI rules from examination boards. \nKieran James, headteacher at Les Varendes, said each exam board had different rules about appropriate AI use.\nAs schools may use different exam boards for different subjects, this could be challenging, as the definition of acceptable AI use could alter depending on which class a student was taking, he said. \nHe said education gave students \"transferable skills\" and felt that AI was \"not threatening the current system\".\nMr James compared using AI to using a calculator, saying parents were originally concerned about the use of those devices, but in reality using the tool correctly still required learning.\n\"It's the same with AI... it's a tool and it can be used really effectively as long as it's used appropriately, and not, for example, to pass off AI's work as a student's own.\"\nMr James added that if used responsibly, AI had the power to support students outside the classroom when teachers were not available. \nHe explained students could use AI as a \"personal tutor\" to practise questions and mark exams. \nEd Gregson, a media teacher at Les Varandes, said he used AI to support his marking workload. \nHe said using AI for administrative and more repetitive tasks freed up time, and allowed him to focus on tasks that required more attention and creativity. \nHowever, the development of AI also made him concerned about his future role in teaching.\n\"I'm terrified to say that I think it marks better than I do. Humans are tired... you kind of know that your personal bias is entering in to your marking,\" he added.\nDave Costen, digital lead for Elizabeth College, said AI was not yet able to substitute for teaching.\nMr Costen said one difference was AI gave \"too much [information] to students straight away\" whereas teachers \"develop the learning [of students] gradually\".\nStudents generally have a poor understanding of AI, he said.\nDespite this, some Elizabeth College students had experimented with the technology, he said. \nOne student explained to the BBC that AI was not good at adjusting the difficulty of example questions. \nAnother student said some of their peers over-relied on AI, and used it to complete work for them, which was not helping them learn.\nAI was also better at some subjects than others, a third explained. It was very strong at coding, but in subjects that required reasoning it \"really struggled\".\nParent Gazz Barbe said he uses parental controls to restrict his daughter's phone use, and added that he did not allow the use of AI technology. \n\"I worry that if I give my daughter unrestricted access to this technology, she will use it to complete homework assignments. \n\"And if she does this in a subject that she really struggles with, she could easily become over-reliant on the technology,\" he said.\n\"The positive potential is absolutely massive... so long as it's used as a tool to assist teachers instead of doing the teaching,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

At 1-0 he clattered an effort against the underside of the crossbar, and at 1-1 had a thumping header hit the post.\nThe England international set up Villa's second with a driving dart forward before slipping in Ian Maatsen with a perfectly weighted pass.\nAnd he otherwise impressed with tireless runs, fine hold-up play and continual pressing.\nWatkins was substituted in the 82nd minute, by which point Villa were already 4-1 up and Villa Park was chanting his name.\nFormer Liverpool and England midfielder Jamie Redknapp said Watkins' performance was \"dynamite\" and believes the striker \"has turned a massive negative into a positive\".\n\"He has played with anger. I have been here, you are fuming and want to knock the manager's door down. He channelled that in the right way,\" Redknapp added.\nWatkins' goal means he is the first Villa player to score 15 or more times in three consecutive Premier League seasons.\nSince the start of last season he has both scored and assisted in eight Premier League games, with only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah doing so on more occasions.",

        "article_text": "The best thing about Coachella is that it happens twice - so if you missed the first weekend, don't worry! \nLady Gaga, Travis Scott, Charli XCX and everyone else will return to the Colorado Desert on Friday for a second dose of musical mayhem, and punishing gusts of wind.\nBetter yet, the opening weekend let us know who was worth watching (Lady Gaga), who we can safely avoid (Travis Scott) and who might be this year's breakout star (Benson Boone).\nWith that in mind, here's a guide to this weekend's sets - and when you can watch them on Coachella's comprehensive YouTube livestream.\nLady Gaga's elaborate stage performances have been known to collapse under the weight of their own ambition. Not this time.\nHer second visit to Coachella, after stepping in as a last-minute replacement for Beyonc\u00e9 in 2017, was one of the greatest pop performances ever. Two hours full of energy and presence and pounding synth hooks.\nStaged in a crumbling gothic opera house, the two-hour show depicted the star's  inner angels and demons wrestling for her soul.\nDuring Poker Face, the two sides faced off in a deadly game of chess; while Perfect Celebrity - a song about her tabloid commodification in the 2000s - saw her buried in a shallow grave, singing to a skeleton.\nIt was bold and audacious and over the top, in all the best ways, with celebratory, nine-minute performance of Bad Romance to cap it all off. \nIf you only watch one performance, make it this one.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 11:10pm on Friday (local time), or 7:10am on Saturday (UK time).\nDespite a career that's lasted three decades, Missy Elliot only staged her first ever tour last year. \nLuckily, tracks like Get Ur Freak On, Lose Control and Pass That Dutch still sound as fresh and futuristic now as they did first time around - and Missy's relative lack of stage experience was never apparent.\nShe arrived onstage inside a giant car exo-skeleton, like a hip-hop Transformer, and sped through her set with pin-sharp choreography and boundless good humour.\nThe only downside was that her set had to end after just 55 minutes.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 9:00pm on Friday (local time), or 5:00am on Saturday (UK time).\n\n\"I'm either going to faint or throw up,\" declared Lola Young near the start of her set last weekend. \"One of the two is about to happen\".\nThe British singer, whose song Messy has been embraced by fans worldwide, was battling sickness and heatstroke throughout her set. But she powered through, leading a mass singalong to Messy, and debuting a new single called Spiders.\nWith her health back on track, her second weekend performance should erase any bad memories from her debut.\nWatch on the Mojave Stage at 4:50pm on Friday (local time), or 12:50am on Saturday (UK time).\nAlthough Travis Scott closed the main stage on Saturday, Green Day were technically the headliners - and the California band delivered a thrilling, cathartic set worthy of their billing.\nThey plunged head-first into a furious rendition of American Idiot, keeping up their recent tradition of changing the lyrics, so that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong sang: \"I'm not part of the MAGA agenda\".\nThat aside, politics were kept to a minimum, as the group delivered a high-voltage blast of their greatest hits, from the bratty pop-punk of Basket Case to the more reflective Boulevard of Broken Dreams.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 9:05pm on Saturday (local time), or 5:05am on Sunday (UK time).\n\"Post-ee, Post-ee, Post-ee.\"\nIt might have been the end of the weekend, but fans still had energy to spare for Post Malone's headline slot on Sunday night.\nHe rewarded them with a laid-back set, that repurposed some of his earlier pop/rap hits with the \"yee-haw\" twang of his recent album F-1 Trillion.\nIt all worked surprisingly well, although the eight-piece band occasionally overpowered his voice, and some fans were disappointed by the lack of hip-hop beats - saying the show would have been better suited to Coachella's sister festival Stagecoach (which is where Post launched his country phase last year).\nSurprisingly, the set was devoid of special guests, leading to speculation that the 29-year-old was holding fire for weekend two. \nAs someone who's recently collaborated with Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Dolly Parton, that could definitely be worth staying up for.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 10:25pm on Sunday (local time), or 6:25am on Monday (UK time).\nIn 2019, Blackpink made history by becoming the first Korean group to headline Coachella. This year, two of its members - Lisa and Jennie - were back with dazzling solo sets, before the band reconvenes for a stadium tour in the summer.\nLisa was up first, on Friday night, with a slick, highly-choreographed set that combined hard-edged rap cuts like Money and Lifestyle, with the softer sounds of Moonlit Floor and Dream.\nAfter her appearance in the third series of The White Lotus, she clarified that music is, in fact, her main job. Backstage, she held a post-mortem on the performance with her bandmate Ros\u00e9 (Conclusion: The desert wind makes it hard to sing).\nJennie packed the Outdoor Theater on Sunday evening, for a set of clubby disco anthems that don't sound a million miles away from her friend and collaborator Dua Lipa.\nHighlights included the bombastic Like Jennie - produced by Diplo, and boasting it's own viral dance break -  and the swoonsome pop of Love Hangover, which showcased her vocal abilities.\nThe 29-year-old has never been the most precise performer, but it somehow works to her advantage - making her more \"real\" than the imperious perfection of her peers. \nWatch Lisa on the Sahara Stage at 7:45pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45am on Saturday (UK time). Jennie plays the Outdoor Theatre at 7:45pm on Sunday (local time), or 3:45am on Monday (UK time).\nCharli XCX drew one of the weekend's biggest crowds, for a sleazy, hedonistic run-through of her sleazy, hedonistic breakout album, Brat.\nPerforming entirely on her own, the star was in constant motion - a mesmerising blur of hip-rolls, hair tosses, stomach crunches and knee-drops, as she turned Coachella's main stage into sweat-drenched, laser-lit club night.\nCompared to the maximalism of other sets, it was a lesson in how one person can hold a stage on their own... Well, almost.\nAt several points, she brought out her collaborators from Brat's companion album - Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Lorde. It was, one excitable fan commented, \"like The Avengers for gay people\".\nWhether the guest-list will be the same on Coachella's second weekend remains to be seen.

        "article_text": "From nightmares to severe backache, three people with Parkinson's have shared their symptoms and experiences to offer insight into what it is like to live a day in their shoes.\nThe progressive disorder affects the brain, nervous system, and muscle control. It is the fastest growing neurological condition in the world, with about 153,000 people in the UK living with the condition.\nAlison Anderson from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, is one of those people. Like many, she awakes at about 08:00 to the twinkling crescendo of her morning alarm. \nBut unlike many others, this sound shatters the silence six more times throughout her day, reminding her to take her medication. \nThe slightest delay in her dosage, known as off-time, risks her symptoms surfacing and her experiencing anything from tremors to memory difficulties or poor balance.\n\"When this happens, even the simplest of tasks becomes challenging,\" she said. \n\"I become mentally and physically slower, I can't think straight and struggle to speak without forgetting what I'm trying to say. \n\"It's frustrating, at times embarrassing, and it interferes with pretty much everything I'm trying to do,\" she said.\nMs Anderson was diagnosed with the condition in 2015, which at the time came as a \"devastating\" blow.\nBut over the years, she has gradually \"learned to adjust\" to her symptoms, and even discovered a \"slower pace of life\" has made her more appreciative.\nThe 54-year-old has found a close-knit community comprised of four other women with the disease, whom she meets with every week for coffee, cake and a catch-up.\n\"Because we are all facing similar challenges, we are uniquely placed to help and support each other,\" she said.\n\"We also encourage, and at times, coerce each other into trying new things and keeping active. I try to enjoy life and live it to the fullest.\"\nOther symptoms of Parkinson's can include sensory issues, voice changes, facial masking\u00a0- where people experience a reduced ability to express emotions through facial movements - and sleep difficulties. \nAs Glyn Evans from Lydney explains: \"You get distressing dreams most nights. I wake up every couple of hours, sometimes in a ball of sweat.\" \nMr Evans was diagnosed with Parkinson's tremor after noticing a slight shake in his right hand several years ago.\nThis quickly progressed to jaw and tongue tremors, stiffness, severe backache and loss of balance. \nThe 78-year-old said life continues regardless, and he has \"found ways to cope\" with the condition.\n\"What would I say to people about my condition? Don't feel sorry for me,\" he said.\n\"Try to understand that Parkinson's has changed my life but it won't kill me.\"\nMichael Pearce, from Hardwicke, told the BBC his symptoms manifest in the form of fatigue, mobility issues, tremors and urinary incontinence. \n\"I'm very self-conscious at times, frustrated and uncertain,\" he said. \"But only once or twice did I get angry about it. It's nobody's fault, it just is.\n\"The other big thing for me was I stopped being creative. I used to write songs and my sense of humour diminished. Thankfully, these are coming back.\"\nMr Pearce said prescribed medication has since improved his quality of life, but true acceptance of his diagnosis came from within. \n\"I endeavour not to worry about an unknown future,\" he explained.\n\"Parkinson's has been a wake up call about life's priorities, not taking people and things for granted.\n\"This definitely helped in my case, keeping me grounded and philosophical about the situation. I express gratitude for the things I can still do.\" \nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram. Send your story ideas to us on email or via WhatsApp on 0800 313 4630.",

        "article_text": "It was once the Indian start-up world's shining star, but Ola is now battling a multitude of crises.\nFounded in 2010, it quickly became a household name, expanding from ride-hailing to electric vehicles and battery cells, challenging Uber along the way.\nThe company jumped on the AI bandwagon in 2023 with Krutrim, India's first AI company valued at over $1bn.\nMarquee global investors such as Japan's SoftBank, US-based Tiger Global and Singapore's Temasek bankrolled this expansion. Last year, Ola's electric vehicles (EV) arm raised close to $734m (\u00a3567m) in a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO), India's biggest in 2024. \nBut this ambitious rise has been accompanied by a series of controversies lately, particularly at its EV arm.\nOla Electric has lost close to 70% of its value in the seven months since the IPO was launched. It is facing competition from more established two-wheeler giants, along with mounting regulatory scrutiny.\nSales of Ola's scooters are down to less than half from April last year and the company's losses have widened. Customers have posted videos on social media of Ola scooters going up in flames or breaking down mid-ride.\nThere's a government inquiry under way at hundreds of newly-opened Ola showrooms regarding licences and registrations. One of its vendors also filed an insolvency plea against the company, which Ola said in a statement to stock exchanges that it had settled.\nThe BBC has learnt from former employees and industry sources that delayed payments have led to many major suppliers and logistics partners ending ties with them.\nOla has been cutting jobs, restructuring operations and automating functions in a bid to reduce costs and trim losses. Media reports say it has undertaken a second round of layoffs since November, with over 1,000 roles axed.\nThe BBC sent detailed questions to Ola about these issues. The company shared links to some of its earlier press statements, not responding specifically to all the queries.\nSo, what's gone wrong?\nOla CEO Bhavish Aggarwal positioned the company as Tesla's two-wheeler equivalent, solving the emissions problem for the price-sensitive Indian market.\nHe poured in millions of marketing dollars, opening Ola showrooms across India, even delivering scooters at the doorstep of people who'd made online bookings.\nBut Ola has struggled to read the market well, says Rohit Paradkar, an analyst with the auto magazine Overdrive. \nIts scooter is modelled on the AppScooter from Etergo, a Dutch start-up that Ola Electric acquired in 2020. \nSeveral former employees told the BBC that Ola's first EV scooter was launched without many changes to Etergo's version. A former employee who worked in the compliance department told the BBC that clearances were rushed through to meet unrealistic launch deadlines. \nIn response to queries, Ola referred to an October 2023 blog post where it addressed the \"myth\" that the vehicle had \"not been engineered and tested for India\". It said it had \"fully re-engineered\" Etergo's scooter and tested it for \"Indian conditions\". \n\"The whole vehicle has been tested at three levels [for India] - digital simulations, component tests and vehicular lab tests, and vehicular field tests,\" it said in the post.\nBut several safety-related incidents reported by customers have raised questions.\nSome scooters began catching fire which, auto experts say, was likely due to short-circuits or faulty battery management system. \nOla recalled more than 1,400 first-generation scooters in 2022 to investigate the fires, but the report was not publicly released. It had then said the battery systems were compliant for Indian and European standards but didn't explain what caused the fires.\nSome riders also reported the front suspension - which holds the wheel in place - breaking mid-ride, causing injuries. \nIn early 2023, after such an accident, Ola called it a rare case, noting there were only a few such issues among 150,000 scooters. \nThe front fork arm, they said, had a significant safety margin for accidents and was designed to handle 80% more load than what it would typically experience during daily use.\nMeanwhile, Ola's rivals - mostly established automakers - have rolled out electric scooters smoothly, adding to the pressure on the company.\nTheir entry shook the market. Ola's share had plunged from 52% to 19% by December, then recovered to 25% in January. \nOla aims to sell 50,000 units monthly to turn profitable, but analysts doubt the target, despite the company saying recent restructuring has helped it achieve $10m monthly savings and faster deliveries.\nGovernment data shows that less than 10,000 scooters were sold in February, but Ola claims 25,000, blaming registration delays due to vendor contract changes. The federal transport ministry has issued notices over the discrepancy. Ola said it had registered over 23,000 scooters sold in March and held a 30% market share for the fiscal year.\nBut competing scooters with fewer features are now outselling Ola simply because they come from trusted, well-established brands, said Jay Kale, executive vice-president and auto analyst at Elara Capital.\nTo push sales, Ola has offered deep discounts, launching newer models at cheaper price points. But losses have widened to $65m in the October-December quarter from $43.6m a year ago.\nBesides product issues, the reliability of its customer service has been another major issue, says Kale.\nWhen angry customers flooded social media and consumer helplines with complaints about the fires and front suspension, their service requests were reportedly unanswered for days.\nAt one point, thousands of complaints were piling up monthly, a former employee at Ola told the BBC. India's consumer rights agency, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), also sent a notice to Ola after it got 10,000 complaints over the period of a year.\nBut since Ola had eschewed the established dealer route in a bid to sell directly to buyers and had just a few service centres, aggrieved consumers had few places to turn to.\nLate last year, Ola wrote to the CCPA that it had a \"robust mechanism to address complaints\", and that most raised with the regulator had been satisfactorily resolved.\nAggarwal was initially dismissive of the problems on social media but later announced that Ola would be opening nearly 4,000 stores with service facilities, following a heated public exchange on X with a stand-up comedian who took up the customers' cause.\nA majority of these new centres, however, came under the government's scanner for lacking relevant licences to store and sell vehicles.\nOn 21 March, Ola confirmed investigations in four states and said it was responding to authorities.\nThe sharp turn in Ola's fortunes is making investors - especially those who bought in at high IPO valuations - nervous.\nOla has been a key player in India's push to cut carbon emissions and expand manufacturing.\nIt benefits from two separate state subsidies, one to make scooters and the second to set up its own 20 gigawatt EV battery plant. But Reuters has reported that the costly gigafactory project is delayed and has missed a key milestone, potentially leading to penalties.\nCritics say Ola's troubles emanate from typical culture issues that plague many start-ups - including CEO-driven decision-making, constant pivots and unrealistic, high-pressure deadlines.\n\"Software mindsets don't work with hardware products, which need time to build,\" said Deepesh Rathore, who used to head product strategy at Ola Electric and now runs consultancy firm Insight EV.\nSome top executives across the wider company have quit recently, including a former Ola Cab CEO who quit within months. Key leaders in tech, marketing, sales and business also left last year. \nExperts say the exits have also affected Ola's efforts to fix product and service issues.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them,\" he said, adding that he expects to cut deals with every country \"over the next three to four weeks\".\nTrump also suggested thathe was reluctant to further raise tariffs on China - which currently stand at 145%. \n\"I may not want to go higher. I may want to go to less because you know, you want people to buy and, at a certain point, people aren't gonna buy,\" he told reporters at the White House.\nAt a press conference on Thursday following Trump's and Meloni's conversation, the leaders said they had discussed defence spending, immigration and tariffs.\nThe atmosphere in the Oval Office appeared relaxed and good-natured - similar to the reception UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer received during his visit to the White House in February.\nHowever Meloni's aides had described the visit as a \"commercial peace mission\" following Trump's decision to impose a 10% baseline tariff on almost all foreign imports to the US. \nHe has strongly criticised the European Union on trade, claiming it was \"formed to screw the United States\". A 20% \"retaliatory\" tariff on the EU has been temporarily suspended until July.\nMeloni previously called the tariffs \"absolutely wrong\" and said they would end up damaging the EU \"as much as the US\".\nWhile she didn't score any tangible wins on tariffs during the meeting, she did convince Trump to accept an invitation to visit Rome, which she said would be an occasion for him to meet other European leaders.\nGiven the fraught relations between the EU and the US, Meloni will likely chalk that up as a significant win, particularly if Trump agrees to meet the president of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen, during the visit.\nMeloni will return to Europe with stronger credentials as the so-called \"Trump whisperer\", something that will be reinforced when she meets US Vice President JD Vance in Rome tomorrow.\nThe Italian leader was careful to praise Trump and align herself with the US president's viewpoints.\nIn her statement following the meeting, she criticised \"woke ideology\" and championed the \"war against illegal migration\".\n\"The goal for me is to make the West great again, and I think we can do it together,\" she added.\nShe also seized the opportunity to tout the work of her own government. \"I'm proud of sitting here as prime minister of an Italy that today has a very good situation - a stable country, a reliable country,\" Meloni said. \nShe noted that her government had brought inflation down and improved employment, before gesturing towards Trump and adding with a broad smile: \"Forgive me if I promote my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me\". Trump grinned back.\nMeloni basked in the praise lavished on her by Trump - from compliments about her work as prime minister to gushing about her Italian sounding \"beautiful\".\nThe US president praised Meloni for taking a tough stance on immigration and said he wished more people were like her. Meloni said that change was happening, thanks to the example set by Italy, referring to yesterday's EU announcement on safe countries.\nIt was only occasionally that she showed a tinge of irritation when asked about Italy's low defence spending.\nMeloni said that she expects Italy to announce at the next Nato meeting in June that her country would be able to meet the alliance's requirement that each member nation spends 2% of GDP on defence.\nDefence spending has been a key sticking point for Trump, with the US leader repeatedly demanding that Nato allies increase spending. \nItaly is one of eight countries that currently does not meet the 2% threshold, spending 1.49% on defence.\nItalian opposition leader Carlo Calenda said there had been \"two very positive outcomes\" from the visit: that Meloni \"stayed on track on Ukraine and managed to convince Trump to meet EU figures in Italy\".\nCalenda said Meloni had \"gained credibility as a bridge between the US and the EU\" but criticised her praise of \"Trump's fight on woke culture\".",

These were 10-year-olds,\" one teacher said.\nAnother teacher said: \"In a secondary English class last year, a group of boys opted, despite discouragement, to write a persuasive essay on why Andrew Tate is the GOAT (greatest of all time) which included praise of his view that women are a man's property... all of the parents were contacted and were appalled.\"\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2023, when pushed on whether his controversial views on women harmed young people, Tate claimed he was a \"force for good\". \nPatrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said \"there is an urgent need for concerted action involving schools, colleges and other agencies to safeguard all children and young people from the dangerous influence of far-right populists and extremists\".\n\"Teachers cannot be left alone to deal with these problems,\" he added.\nBut the founder of a group which trains professionals in how to work with boys and young men said the access young people have to pornography is \"way more impactful\" than the influence of people like Tate.\nMichael Conroy, who launched Men at Work in 2019, told BBC Breakfast: \"Without porn, Andrew Tate would not be a known name.\n\"Our boys, sadly, are learning about sex through porn, and it is usually representing to them a difference of power between men and women. \n\"That chimes when they see work from people like Andrew Tate.

With doctors struggling to cope, the BBC followed one GP through her shift at a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) clinic.\nBy 07:30, a slight figure in a pink headscarf, Dr Wissam Sukkar, is picking her way through the devastated streets of Gaza City.\n\"I was walking for around 50 minutes to reach our clinic,\" she explains when she is met by a local BBC journalist who helped us log her day. With virtually no fuel left in Gaza, few taxis are running.\n\"With our limited resources we're still trying to be here in northern Gaza through these difficult times,\" adds Dr Sukkar.\nThe UN's World Health Organization (WHO) says that only 21 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are currently partially functional. Medical supplies are running critically low due to Israel's ongoing blockade of Gaza.\nThe GP points out what is left of her former workplace, an MSF burns clinic that came under fire in the early weeks of the war, during street battles between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters.\nHer team has now converted an office towards the west of Gaza City into a clinic - and by 09:30, as Dr Sukkar is putting on her white robe, there are already some 150 people waiting outside in a tented reception area.\n\"Most of our patients are displaced people,\" Dr Sukkar says. \"They live in shelters, they even live in tents in the streets.\"\nSince a ceasefire collapsed a month ago, thousands of Gazans have once again left their homes and fled to this neighbourhood, seeking safety.\nWith little food and clean water, there is a rise in malnutrition and diseases - from stomach bugs to scabies. The elderly and young are worst affected, and the first patients of the day are babies with viral infections.\n\"We receive a lot of children who suffer from upper respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea. In the shelters, there are a lot of children in the same place and a virus can spread very quickly,\" the doctor explains.\nOne toddler has his face dotted with mosquito bites and Dr Sukkar administers some soothing cream. As cooking gas has run out, families have taken to using open fires to heat food and this has also led to an increase in serious burns.\nWithin an hour, Dr Sukkar and three other physicians have seen dozens of patients. But there are many whom they struggle to help.\n\"We have more and more challenges with the huge number of patients with less and less medical supplies,\" Dr Sukkar says wearily.\n\"Also, we receive complicated cases, and we don't know where to refer these patients because the health system in Gaza has collapsed.\"\nThere has been an influx in seriously wounded patients arriving at the clinic since last Sunday, when Israeli warplanes attacked al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City.\nIsrael accused Hamas of using a hospital building as a \"command and control centre\"; something the armed group denied.\nAl-Ahli - which was the main medical site for treating trauma in northern Gaza - can no longer accept patients. The WHO says the emergency room, laboratory, X-ray machines and pharmacy were destroyed.\n\"I started my treatment at al-Shifa hospital, then I got transferred to al-Ahli and they bombed it,\" says Saeed Barkat, an older man with a fractured thigh bone, who arrives at the MSF clinic on crutches.\nHe had surgery after he was wounded by Israeli artillery fire on the shelter where he was staying late last year. He has pins in his leg, and it is swollen.\n\"I came here for any treatment and to follow-up,\" says Mr Barkat, as nurses change his dressing and give new painkillers.\nAt midday, when Dr Sukkar checks on the small pharmacy at the clinic, she looks worried. Many of the shelves are bare.\nIsrael closed all crossings to Gaza at the start of March, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages it is holding. Since then, no aid has entered.\n\"For diabetes, we don't have insulin, we don't have treatments for epilepsy, we don't have basic medicines like anti-fever drugs,\" Dr Sukkar says.\n\"It's the season for skin infections and we don't have creams or ointments for bacterial infections, no medicines to treat scabies and head lice.\"\nThe doctors are rationing the supplies that remain.\n\"We are doing our best so that it will be enough for the coming week,\" sums up Dr Sukkar, \"but we expect that our stock will run out in more or less two weeks.\"\nSoon Dr Sukkar is back in her consultation room. The rush of patients continues with many more sick children. They have coughs, fevers and stomach upsets.\nBy 15:30, it is time to close up the clinic for the day. The four doctors here calculate that they have seen nearly 390 patients.\nAfter a long, tiring day, there is the long, tiring walk home for Dr Sukkar.\nAs she leaves the clinic she telephones her family. Her thoughts turn to looking after her own children, who have been displaced with her nine times in the past year and a half.\n\"Like every Gazan, I have a daily struggle to secure clean water, food for my kids,\" says Dr Sukkar. \"We don't have electricity, so it's really hard even to charge the battery of my mobile.\"\n\"Most of all, it's really hard to have any hope,\" she goes on. \"I feel I live in a nightmare that doesn't end. When will this war end?\"\nFor now, there is no answer, and no respite.",

        "article_text": "It was once the Indian start-up world's shining star, but Ola is now battling a multitude of crises.\nFounded in 2010, it quickly became a household name, expanding from ride-hailing to electric vehicles and battery cells, challenging Uber along the way.\nThe company jumped on the AI bandwagon in 2023 with Krutrim, India's first AI company valued at over $1bn.\nMarquee global investors such as Japan's SoftBank, US-based Tiger Global and Singapore's Temasek bankrolled this expansion. Last year, Ola's electric vehicles (EV) arm raised close to $734m (\u00a3567m) in a blockbuster initial public offering (IPO), India's biggest in 2024. \nBut this ambitious rise has been accompanied by a series of controversies lately, particularly at its EV arm.\nOla Electric has lost close to 70% of its value in the seven months since the IPO was launched. It is facing competition from more established two-wheeler giants, along with mounting regulatory scrutiny.\nSales of Ola's scooters are down to less than half from April last year and the company's losses have widened. Customers have posted videos on social media of Ola scooters going up in flames or breaking down mid-ride.\nThere's a government inquiry under way at hundreds of newly-opened Ola showrooms regarding licences and registrations. One of its vendors also filed an insolvency plea against the company, which Ola said in a statement to stock exchanges that it had settled.\nThe BBC has learnt from former employees and industry sources that delayed payments have led to many major suppliers and logistics partners ending ties with them.\nOla has been cutting jobs, restructuring operations and automating functions in a bid to reduce costs and trim losses. Media reports say it has undertaken a second round of layoffs since November, with over 1,000 roles axed.\nThe BBC sent detailed questions to Ola about these issues. The company shared links to some of its earlier press statements, not responding specifically to all the queries.\nSo, what's gone wrong?\nOla CEO Bhavish Aggarwal positioned the company as Tesla's two-wheeler equivalent, solving the emissions problem for the price-sensitive Indian market.\nHe poured in millions of marketing dollars, opening Ola showrooms across India, even delivering scooters at the doorstep of people who'd made online bookings.\nBut Ola has struggled to read the market well, says Rohit Paradkar, an analyst with the auto magazine Overdrive. \nIts scooter is modelled on the AppScooter from Etergo, a Dutch start-up that Ola Electric acquired in 2020. \nSeveral former employees told the BBC that Ola's first EV scooter was launched without many changes to Etergo's version. A former employee who worked in the compliance department told the BBC that clearances were rushed through to meet unrealistic launch deadlines. \nIn response to queries, Ola referred to an October 2023 blog post where it addressed the \"myth\" that the vehicle had \"not been engineered and tested for India\". It said it had \"fully re-engineered\" Etergo's scooter and tested it for \"Indian conditions\". \n\"The whole vehicle has been tested at three levels [for India] - digital simulations, component tests and vehicular lab tests, and vehicular field tests,\" it said in the post.\nBut several safety-related incidents reported by customers have raised questions.\nSome scooters began catching fire which, auto experts say, was likely due to short-circuits or faulty battery management system. \nOla recalled more than 1,400 first-generation scooters in 2022 to investigate the fires, but the report was not publicly released. It had then said the battery systems were compliant for Indian and European standards but didn't explain what caused the fires.\nSome riders also reported the front suspension - which holds the wheel in place - breaking mid-ride, causing injuries. \nIn early 2023, after such an accident, Ola called it a rare case, noting there were only a few such issues among 150,000 scooters. \nThe front fork arm, they said, had a significant safety margin for accidents and was designed to handle 80% more load than what it would typically experience during daily use.\nMeanwhile, Ola's rivals - mostly established automakers - have rolled out electric scooters smoothly, adding to the pressure on the company.\nTheir entry shook the market. Ola's share had plunged from 52% to 19% by December, then recovered to 25% in January. \nOla aims to sell 50,000 units monthly to turn profitable, but analysts doubt the target, despite the company saying recent restructuring has helped it achieve $10m monthly savings and faster deliveries.\nGovernment data shows that less than 10,000 scooters were sold in February, but Ola claims 25,000, blaming registration delays due to vendor contract changes. The federal transport ministry has issued notices over the discrepancy. Ola said it had registered over 23,000 scooters sold in March and held a 30% market share for the fiscal year.\nBut competing scooters with fewer features are now outselling Ola simply because they come from trusted, well-established brands, said Jay Kale, executive vice-president and auto analyst at Elara Capital.\nTo push sales, Ola has offered deep discounts, launching newer models at cheaper price points. But losses have widened to $65m in the October-December quarter from $43.6m a year ago.\nBesides product issues, the reliability of its customer service has been another major issue, says Kale.\nWhen angry customers flooded social media and consumer helplines with complaints about the fires and front suspension, their service requests were reportedly unanswered for days.\nAt one point, thousands of complaints were piling up monthly, a former employee at Ola told the BBC. India's consumer rights agency, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), also sent a notice to Ola after it got 10,000 complaints over the period of a year.\nBut since Ola had eschewed the established dealer route in a bid to sell directly to buyers and had just a few service centres, aggrieved consumers had few places to turn to.\nLate last year, Ola wrote to the CCPA that it had a \"robust mechanism to address complaints\", and that most raised with the regulator had been satisfactorily resolved.\nAggarwal was initially dismissive of the problems on social media but later announced that Ola would be opening nearly 4,000 stores with service facilities, following a heated public exchange on X with a stand-up comedian who took up the customers' cause.\nA majority of these new centres, however, came under the government's scanner for lacking relevant licences to store and sell vehicles.\nOn 21 March, Ola confirmed investigations in four states and said it was responding to authorities.\nThe sharp turn in Ola's fortunes is making investors - especially those who bought in at high IPO valuations - nervous.\nOla has been a key player in India's push to cut carbon emissions and expand manufacturing.\nIt benefits from two separate state subsidies, one to make scooters and the second to set up its own 20 gigawatt EV battery plant. But Reuters has reported that the costly gigafactory project is delayed and has missed a key milestone, potentially leading to penalties.\nCritics say Ola's troubles emanate from typical culture issues that plague many start-ups - including CEO-driven decision-making, constant pivots and unrealistic, high-pressure deadlines.\n\"Software mindsets don't work with hardware products, which need time to build,\" said Deepesh Rathore, who used to head product strategy at Ola Electric and now runs consultancy firm Insight EV.\nSome top executives across the wider company have quit recently, including a former Ola Cab CEO who quit within months. Key leaders in tech, marketing, sales and business also left last year. \nExperts say the exits have also affected Ola's efforts to fix product and service issues.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Rohit Sharma won five IPL titles as captain of Mumbai Indians in an 11-year leadership stint\nRohit Sharma has been under scrutiny for his poor form in the Indian Premier League (IPL), and his struggles so far in 2025 are consistent with a downward trend in the competition over the past three years. \nThe former Mumbai Indians captain, who still leads India's white-ball teams, has scored 82 runs in six innings at an average of 13.66.\nThe opener's 26 from 16 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday was his highest score this season, and with three sixes he showed some glimpses of a return to form before another soft dismissal off Pat Cummins. \n\"He's finding it very hard to be consistent,\" former IPL batter Abhishek Jhunjhunwala told BBC Sport.\nRohit's run drought has also mirrored his own team's form, as Mumbai have struggled to find a consistent winning combination - they are seventh in the table with three wins from seven. \nHowever, this is unique to Rohit in the IPL specifically as he is still having plenty of success internationally with a T20 World Cup win in 2024 and the Champions Trophy title last month. \nHe is also a Mumbai legend having led them to five titles in 11 years as captain, while he is set to have a stand named after him at the iconic Wankhede stadium.\nBut with that success and status comes immense expectation. BBC Sport and CricViz data analyst Soham Sarkhel have looked at the numbers behind Rohit's decline, and what he and Mumbai could do next.\nKeep up to date with the Indian Premier League\nIPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takers\nRohit's average in the IPL is 29.30, but since 2022 he averages 22.89 at the top of the order. That is the second-lowest of the 21 openers to play 20-plus innings.\nHe averages 13.66 in six matches this season - and it is 12.89 if you add the final three games of 2024.\nHis form in T20 internationals hasn't declined in the same way. Since the start of 2022 he averages 29.34 in T20Is compared to 22.89 in the IPL as an opener.\nRohit's best returns in the IPL have come at five (average of 33.11) and four. (average of 32.7). That drops to 27.74 as an opener, with him only averaging more than 30 in 2016 and 2024 (min five innings).\nRohit Sharma has been dismissed in the six-over powerplay in all six of his innings in the 2025 IPL\nAgainst pace in the six-over powerplay his average has dropped from 36.47 to 24.39 since 2022.\nHe has only survived past the powerplay in 12 of his 36 IPL innings since the start of 2023 and is yet to bat outside the powerplay this year.\nThe right-hander used to be a 'balanced' player with 51% of runs in that phase scored on the leg side, but that has climbed to 59%. \nThat could contribute to a decline in his numbers against outswinging deliveries and a rise against inswingers. Before 2022 he averaged 27 against inswingers and close to 50 against outswingers but since then, those numbers are 44 and 19. \nHe used to average 63 against outswingers from right-arm pacers in the powerplay, now it is 16.\nBetween 2014 and 2021 Rohit was out seven times to left-arm seamers and averaged 28.85. Since 2022 he has been dismissed eight times and averages 22.37. It equates for 24% of the balls he has faced too, up from 13%. \nRohit is also struggling against spin. He averages 15.33 since 2022, down from 34.68. \nThere is a particular weakness against leg-spin, which he averages 7.88 against since 2022. \nThe sweep shot is also getting him into trouble. He used it just 7% of the time between 2014 and 2021 and was out eight times. That was climbed to 21% of deliveries since 2022 and he has been dismissed six times, at an average of 15.5.\nThat's a trend in all formats with Rohit's last 30 sweep shots across all formats seeing him dismissed seven times, at an average of seven. \nMumbai's most recent IPL title came in 2020, having also won the previous year, and Rohit was replaced as skipper by Hardik Pandya in 2024 - but in the all-rounder's first edition in charge, they finished bottom of the table. \nRohit's legendary status with the side is likely to earn him a longer run in order to solve his personal batting problems, but it could present the Mumbai hierarchy with a brave call to make if he cannot regain form - and if the team maintains its inconsistency, too. \n\"There is a lot of pressure on him, especially when he's playing for India,\" Jhunjhunwala added.\n\"In the IPL, they are ruthless as we've seen with so many players, and we've seen that with Mumbai Indians.\n\"There will be patience with him, especially at Mumbai, because he's done brilliantly for them over the years.\n\"He's still got it. I just feel that he's maybe lost a bit of hand-eye coordination and that can happen, but your career can really go down quite quickly. He's got to work on a lot of things, especially his fitness.\"\nFormer England bowler Tymal Mills, who played with Rohit at Mumbai in 2022, also backed him to rediscover his best form and described him as \"a nightmare for bowlers\" when in full flow. \n\"He's one of the most experienced players in the world, he has been there and done it at the highest level for a very long time,\" Mills told BBC Sport.\n\"He will stick to his processes, he will hit a lot of balls. You'll always see him going to training early and getting his extra work done before everyone else arrives. \n\"When you have played as long as Rohit has, you're going to go through bad spells. Players of his class always re-emerge.\n\"He has earned the right to get a long leash because he's had such a successful career and been a nightmare for bowlers.\"\nMills also questioned whether being the impact sub - which Rohit has been in five of his six games, including three times when batting second - was a \"hindrance\" because it could \"take you a bit longer to get into the game\". \nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Last year, Alfie Watts went global, becoming the youngest ever winner of Race Across the World - the BBC show that does exactly what it says on the tin.\nTeams of two race to get from one part of the world to another with no air travel, no smartphones, no bank cards and a limited cash budget. \nAfter 50 days spent travelling by land and sea from Japan to Indonesia alongside his St Albans schoolfriend Owen Wood, it all came down to a foot race by a beach off the island of Lombok.\nThe series four finale saw the pair pip mother and daughter duo Eugenie and Isabel by a mere eight minutes to take the title and \u00a320,000 prize pot.\nIt also saw Alfie catch the travel bug, sending him on his way to a new career as a travel guru and online content creator.\nAs series five of the show gets underway on Wednesday, BBC News speaks to the 21-year-old about his new life on the road, advice for fellow travellers and tips for this year's contestants on how to win the show.\n\"The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,\" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.\n\"I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.\n\"And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is. \n\"And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.\"\nWatts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling further afield.\n\"Flights to Spain in the summer might be \u00a3300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,\" he notes.\n\"Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be \u00a3600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending \u00a320-25 a day maximum.\"\nSince his big TV win, he's been to around 30 countries, including five in one day for a Europe-based online challenge.\nAnother time he found and boarded the cheapest possible flights he could find online for seven days straight.\nAnd he also returned to Japan to pay a bill he felt he owed for some Kobe beef steaks that were kindly donated to him and Owen for free when they were worried about their budget, as fans of the show will remember. \"That was a really nice moment,\" he says.\nWatts likes to travel solo as he enjoys his \"own company\" and doing things on his \"own terms\", while also meeting new people.\nHe acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to \"throw yourself in\".\n\"I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,\" he says.\nHe does admit though that he once ended up in a taxi with an armed government official in Venezuela - a country he travelled to against UK goverment guidance.\n\"That was about as wacky as it got.\"\nHis favourite place he has been on his travels so far is \"without doubt\" Angel Falls in Venezuela, while his favourite country would be a coin flip between Jordan and Malaysia.\nOne thing he'd still like to tick off his bucket list is visiting the remote island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific Ocean, which sounds like a pitch for a new TV show in itself.\n\"It's the least visited country in the world,\" he explains.\n\"Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"\nAs well as becoming far better travelled, the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways, acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK, a mental health charity for young people, and Winston's Wish, a children and young people's grief charity.\nOne of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.\nSpeaking of his ambassadorial work, he says: \"I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].\n \"But internalising it, it can be quite challenging, listening to people's stories.\"\nRace Across the World resumes on Wednesday, with a new raft of contestants heading this time from north eastern China to the southernmost tip of India.\nThey include ex-spouses Gaz and Yin, and current couple Fin and Sioned, as well as sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, brothers Brian and Melvyn and mother and son duo Caroline and Tom.\nThe rules, as usual, are no smart phones, no bank cards (just a small cash budget) and no air travel.\nWatts thinks it's going to be a \"really tough route\" and \"a topsy turvey\" series.\n\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"\nHis \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".\nHe'd also suggest taking \"little travel placards\" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.\n\"I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.\n\"And I think we're probably going to see that this series, that people have been a lot more streetwise with how they've prepared.\"\nIs he worried about losing his title as the show's youngest winner?\nHe replies, like a true international diplomat, that he just wants the pair who \"nicely interact\" with the others and \"who genuinely appreciate the opportunity to travel\" to win.\n\"I think those are always the people that you want to do best, and if that happens to be the two 18-year-olds this time, then I'll be happy to hand my crown over.\"\nSeries five of Race Across the World begins on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Wednesday 23 April.",

        "article_text": "Since pop star Katy Perry returned to Earth earlier this week, the number of memes referencing her brief trip to space has skyrocketed.\nAfter weighing in with jokes of its own, American fast-food chain Wendy's has  clarified that its now-viral tweets weren't meant to cause offence.\nFollowing criticism from followers, the company put out a statement this week saying it had no ill-will for Perry.\n\"We always bring a little spice to our socials, but Wendy's has a ton of respect for Katy Perry and her out-of-this-world-talent,\" it said.\nThe star-studded, all-female crew on Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin rocket took off in Texas on Monday and flew for 11 minutes in total. Perry was joined by five other women, including journalist Gayle King and Jeff Bezos's partner Lauren Sanchez.\nBut the \"Fireworks\" singer's reactions captivated the internet more than others'. After landing, she kissed the ground, saying she felt \"so connected to love\".\nKing revealed that Perry sang Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\" while in space.\nMemes and comments began to flood social media platforms, including Wendy's series of posts on its official X account when she landed: \"When we said women in stem this isn't what we meant\" and \"Can we send her back\". \nWhile the space flight was meant to celebrate women, the crew has faced some criticism. The backlash ranged from the environmental impact of the flight to looming cuts for actual Nasa employees.\nOther celebrities also offered their two cents.\n\"I think it's a bit gluttonous,\" actress Olivia Munn said in an appearance on TODAY.  \"Space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they going to do up there that is going to help us down here?\"\nModel and activist Emily Ratajkowski said on TikTok that the flight was \"beyond parody\".\n\"Look at the state of the world and think about how many resources went into putting these women into space,\" she said. \"For what?\"\nBut not all reactions were negative. TV reality star Khloe Kardashian, watching from the viewing platform, said: \"Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age.\"\nOprah Winfrey, a close friend of King, also watched the launch. She was seen tearing up as the craft landed. \n\"I've never been more proud of my friend than today,\" she said. \nKing countered some of the negative comments, saying she believes the flight inspired young women who want to be astronauts.\n\"I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,\" she said.",

        "article_text": "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted. \nEarlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.\nActors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.\nTheir performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.\nPerhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era. \nOn the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double). \nBut on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".\nSo should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?\nBeatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism. \n\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief. \n\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"\nDu Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.\n\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"\nBut he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.\n\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"\nSo does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?\nDu Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch. \n\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"\nEdda Sharpe, a Merseyside-based voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.\nAmong them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.\nBeatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it. \nThe performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.\n\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.\n\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"\nShe said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.\nBut she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.\n\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.\n\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"\nDr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.\nHe said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.\n\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.\n\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.\n\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"\nBut what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films? \nMichael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.\nHawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can. \n\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.\n\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.\n\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"\nThe 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.\nHe added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.\n\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

        "article_text": "The best thing about Coachella is that it happens twice - so if you missed the first weekend, don't worry! \nLady Gaga, Travis Scott, Charli XCX and everyone else will return to the Colorado Desert on Friday for a second dose of musical mayhem, and punishing gusts of wind.\nBetter yet, the opening weekend let us know who was worth watching (Lady Gaga), who we can safely avoid (Travis Scott) and who might be this year's breakout star (Benson Boone).\nWith that in mind, here's a guide to this weekend's sets - and when you can watch them on Coachella's comprehensive YouTube livestream.\nLady Gaga's elaborate stage performances have been known to collapse under the weight of their own ambition. Not this time.\nHer second visit to Coachella, after stepping in as a last-minute replacement for Beyonc\u00e9 in 2017, was one of the greatest pop performances ever. Two hours full of energy and presence and pounding synth hooks.\nStaged in a crumbling gothic opera house, the two-hour show depicted the star's  inner angels and demons wrestling for her soul.\nDuring Poker Face, the two sides faced off in a deadly game of chess; while Perfect Celebrity - a song about her tabloid commodification in the 2000s - saw her buried in a shallow grave, singing to a skeleton.\nIt was bold and audacious and over the top, in all the best ways, with celebratory, nine-minute performance of Bad Romance to cap it all off. \nIf you only watch one performance, make it this one.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 11:10pm on Friday (local time), or 7:10am on Saturday (UK time).\nDespite a career that's lasted three decades, Missy Elliot only staged her first ever tour last year. \nLuckily, tracks like Get Ur Freak On, Lose Control and Pass That Dutch still sound as fresh and futuristic now as they did first time around - and Missy's relative lack of stage experience was never apparent.\nShe arrived onstage inside a giant car exo-skeleton, like a hip-hop Transformer, and sped through her set with pin-sharp choreography and boundless good humour.\nThe only downside was that her set had to end after just 55 minutes.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 9:00pm on Friday (local time), or 5:00am on Saturday (UK time).\n\n\"I'm either going to faint or throw up,\" declared Lola Young near the start of her set last weekend. \"One of the two is about to happen\".\nThe British singer, whose song Messy has been embraced by fans worldwide, was battling sickness and heatstroke throughout her set. But she powered through, leading a mass singalong to Messy, and debuting a new single called Spiders.\nWith her health back on track, her second weekend performance should erase any bad memories from her debut.\nWatch on the Mojave Stage at 4:50pm on Friday (local time), or 12:50am on Saturday (UK time).\nAlthough Travis Scott closed the main stage on Saturday, Green Day were technically the headliners - and the California band delivered a thrilling, cathartic set worthy of their billing.\nThey plunged head-first into a furious rendition of American Idiot, keeping up their recent tradition of changing the lyrics, so that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong sang: \"I'm not part of the MAGA agenda\".\nThat aside, politics were kept to a minimum, as the group delivered a high-voltage blast of their greatest hits, from the bratty pop-punk of Basket Case to the more reflective Boulevard of Broken Dreams.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 9:05pm on Saturday (local time), or 5:05am on Sunday (UK time).\n\"Post-ee, Post-ee, Post-ee.\"\nIt might have been the end of the weekend, but fans still had energy to spare for Post Malone's headline slot on Sunday night.\nHe rewarded them with a laid-back set, that repurposed some of his earlier pop/rap hits with the \"yee-haw\" twang of his recent album F-1 Trillion.\nIt all worked surprisingly well, although the eight-piece band occasionally overpowered his voice, and some fans were disappointed by the lack of hip-hop beats - saying the show would have been better suited to Coachella's sister festival Stagecoach (which is where Post launched his country phase last year).\nSurprisingly, the set was devoid of special guests, leading to speculation that the 29-year-old was holding fire for weekend two. \nAs someone who's recently collaborated with Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Dolly Parton, that could definitely be worth staying up for.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 10:25pm on Sunday (local time), or 6:25am on Monday (UK time).\nIn 2019, Blackpink made history by becoming the first Korean group to headline Coachella. This year, two of its members - Lisa and Jennie - were back with dazzling solo sets, before the band reconvenes for a stadium tour in the summer.\nLisa was up first, on Friday night, with a slick, highly-choreographed set that combined hard-edged rap cuts like Money and Lifestyle, with the softer sounds of Moonlit Floor and Dream.\nAfter her appearance in the third series of The White Lotus, she clarified that music is, in fact, her main job. Backstage, she held a post-mortem on the performance with her bandmate Ros\u00e9 (Conclusion: The desert wind makes it hard to sing).\nJennie packed the Outdoor Theater on Sunday evening, for a set of clubby disco anthems that don't sound a million miles away from her friend and collaborator Dua Lipa.\nHighlights included the bombastic Like Jennie - produced by Diplo, and boasting it's own viral dance break -  and the swoonsome pop of Love Hangover, which showcased her vocal abilities.\nThe 29-year-old has never been the most precise performer, but it somehow works to her advantage - making her more \"real\" than the imperious perfection of her peers. \nWatch Lisa on the Sahara Stage at 7:45pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45am on Saturday (UK time). Jennie plays the Outdoor Theatre at 7:45pm on Sunday (local time), or 3:45am on Monday (UK time).\nCharli XCX drew one of the weekend's biggest crowds, for a sleazy, hedonistic run-through of her sleazy, hedonistic breakout album, Brat.\nPerforming entirely on her own, the star was in constant motion - a mesmerising blur of hip-rolls, hair tosses, stomach crunches and knee-drops, as she turned Coachella's main stage into sweat-drenched, laser-lit club night.\nCompared to the maximalism of other sets, it was a lesson in how one person can hold a stage on their own... Well, almost.\nAt several points, she brought out her collaborators from Brat's companion album - Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Lorde. It was, one excitable fan commented, \"like The Avengers for gay people\".\nWhether the guest-list will be the same on Coachella's second weekend remains to be seen. But Charli is worth your time either way.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 7:15pm on Saturday (local time), or 3:15am on Sunday (UK time).\nAnyone who's had the pleasure of watching Benson Boone over the last year will know he's fond of performing a front flip off his piano, the big show off.\nHe didn't let us down at Coachella - bouncing around the stage like a Duracell Bunny attached to a car battery. To cap it all off, he brought out Brian May for a surprisingly successful version of Bohemian Rhapsody.\nLess fortunate, however, was Texan singer d4vd, whose attempt at a backflip went disastrously wrong.\nThankfully, he recovered in time to pull off an energetic set that highlighted the life-affirming vibes of his bedroom pop hits Feel It and What Are You Waiting For.\nAfter the set, he swore to practice harder for this weekend's performance. \"Imagine if I fall again,\" he cringed.\nWatch Benson Boone on the Coachella Stage at 7:05pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45 am on Saturday (UK Time). D4vd plays the Gobi Stage at 5:55pm on Friday (local time), or 1:55am on Saturday (UK time).\nLast Saturday, the entire LA Philharmonic Orchestra boarded a bus and set off for the desert to make their Coachella debut.\nUnder the baton of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, they performed what was billed as \"Gustavo's mixtape\" - moving seamlessly between classical standards like Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and modern pop hits.\nFor the latter, they were joined on stage by a host of A-list stars, including indie titan Beck, Icelandic songstress Laufey, country singer Maren Morris and rap icon LL Cool J.\n\"I told to the orchestra, 'I'm so happy conducting, but I wish I could be in the middle of the crowd and enjoy the moment,'\" Dudamel told Variety magazine ahead of the show.\nWeekend two will feature an all-new array of guest stars, he promised, but details are being kept under wraps for now. \nThe LA Philharmonic plays the Outdoor Theatre at 6:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 2:25am on Sunday (UK time).\n\"It took me 20 years to get on this stage,\" said T-Pain towards the end of his set on Saturday, and he certainly made the most of his hour-long set.\nHe covered Journey's Don't Stop Believin' and Chris Stapleton's country hit Tennessee Whiskey, while racing through early 2000s hits like Buy U A Drank and I'm In Luv, and revisiting his verses on Flo Rida's Low, and Kanye West's Good Life.\nFor that, he received a hero's welcome, with the crowd treating his set as an excuse for some turn of the millennium escapism. \nBy the time it ended, a campaign had started for T-Pain to play next year's Super Bowl half-time show.\nWatch on the Coachella Stage at 5:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 1:25am on Sunday (UK time).\nLuckily, you're not forced to stay up all night to watch the stars strut their stuff in California.\nCoachella's generous livestreams repeat throughout the day, and you can rewind several hours to find the performances you want.\nOther highlights from the first weekend included Megan Thee Stallion, whose star-studded set included appearances from Queen Latifah, Victoria Mon\u00e9t, and Ciara; and Kraftwerk, reminding everyone that they essentially invented electronic music.\nBelinda Carlisle reunited with her old band The Go-Gos for a dose of sun-kissed 1980s nostalgia, and the UK's Sam Fender tore through a blistering set that showcased the songwriting chops of his new album, People Watching.\nAmong the newcomers with main stage aspirations were South Africa's hip-swivelling R&B star Tyla, and New York dance act Fcukers, whose breakout hit Bon Bon was one of the weekend's most inescapable tracks.\nYou can see the full line-up for Coachella's second weekend on the festival's website.",

        "article_text": "Before Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened its sovereignty, the Canadian psyche was consumed with another major issue: housing affordability. With an election on the horizon, voters are wondering if any party has a plan to fix what has become a generational problem. \nWillow Yamauchi says she was just a \"regular\" person when she and her husband bought their family home in Vancouver 25 years ago for a modest sum of C$275,000 - around C$435,000 ($312,000; \u00a3236,400) in today's dollars.\nThat same property is now worth several million. \nIn the city in Canada's pacific northwest, Ms Yamauchi's story is as common as the rainy weather. The average price of a detached home in Vancouver in 2000 was around C$350,000. Now, it is more than C$2m.\n\"My husband and I were very privileged to be able to purchase a house when we did,\" the 52-year-old writer tells the BBC. As a member of Generation X, timing was on her side. \nThe same, she says, cannot be said for younger people, who - without \"the bank of mom and dad\" - are effectively priced out of the city they grew up in.\nVancouver, a cultural and economic hub with a population of less than one million, is often seen as the epicentre of Canada's housing crisis. A report by Chapman University in California last year listed it among the top \"impossibly unaffordable\" cities in the world. \nBut it is not the only Canadian city where the cost of homes is out of reach for many. Canada as a whole has one of the highest house-price-to-income ratios among developed nations.\nIn 2021, the average household income after taxes in Canada was around C$88,000, according to national data. That same year, the average home price hit C$713,500 - more than eight times higher. The gap is even larger in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.\nFor many Canadians, housing is one of the top issues in the federal election, eclipsed only recently by US President Donald Trump and his tariffs on Canada. Before Trump, concerns on housing affordability had boosted the Conservative Party, which has consistently been seen as the best equipped to fix the crisis. Its success on pocketbook issues in general had threatened to collapse of the governing Liberal party, which only recently catapulted to the top of the polls in the wake of a trade war with the US.\nEven with the Trump factor, the topic featured prominently in the two federal leaders debate this week. During the French debate, moderator and journalist Patrice Roy displayed figures showing how much home prices had increased in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in the last decade. \n\"I'm sure this won't come as a surprise,\" Mr Roy told the federal leaders, before asking for their plans on how they would fix the crisis.\nPolls show young people are especially worried about the housing crisis and what it means for their future. \nSpeaking to students at the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Vancouver campus, it quickly became clear that the issue was top of mind for many.\nMany said they have either opted to live at home during their studies to save on costs, or are paying anywhere from C$1,100 to C$1,500 for a single room near campus, often in a home shared with five or six others.\nEmily Chu, a 24-year-old who is in her final semester at UBC, says that she at one point had to delay her studies by two years in order to work, as she struggled to afford paying both tuition and rent.\nShe now shares an apartment with her older brother, who works full-time and pays the majority of the rent. Ms Chu considers herself one of the lucky ones.\nAs for home ownership in the future, she says \"that's not even possible\" for most people her age. \"Everybody kind of assumes that we can't ever own housing.\"\nYoung professionals with well-paying jobs, like Margareta Dovgal, are also priced out. The 28-year-old director at Vancouver-based non-profit Resource Works told the BBC that she has considered moving to the neighbouring province of Alberta due to its lower cost of living, despite being a lifelong and \"committed Vancouverite\".\nStill, Calgary, Alberta's largest city, saw house prices increase by 15% in 2024 from the previous year as the city experienced its highest population growth rate since 2001.\nThe root causes of Canada's housing affordability crisis are complex. One of the main issues is a supply that has not kept up with a growing population, which has driven up costs for both buyers and renters. \nThe Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the national housing agency, estimates that more than 3.8 million homes need to be built in the next six years to address the shortage.\nConstruction of new housing, however, has been well below that target, raising questions on whether Canada will meet this goal. Experts say barriers to ramping up building include the high cost and scarcity of land in urban areas, where most Canadians tend to live and work.\nThere are also regional barriers, like city zoning laws that prevent the construction of more affordable, higher density housing - including apartment buildings or multiplexes - in some neighbourhoods.\nDaniel Oleksiuk, co-founder of the advocacy group Abundant Housing Vancouver, says his city is one example, where more than half of the land has historically been zoned for single-family homes.\n\"We've kept almost all of the land reserved,\" Mr Oleksiuk told the BBC. \"There are whole neighbourhoods where all you have is three to five million dollar homes.\"\nOn the campaign trail, each major federal party has put forward a plan to fix the crisis, all with the goal of building as many homes as quickly as possible.\nThe Liberals, led by Mark Carney, said their aim is to build 500,000 new homes a year with the help of a new government agency called Build Canada Homes that would oversee and finance the construction of affordable housing in Canada - a plan similar to one implemented after the Second World War to house veterans.\nCritics have questioned whether Carney's target is viable, as it would require Canada to more than double its current construction rate.\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, vowed to tie federal funding to housing starts by rewarding cities that build more homes and penalising those that block construction - a carrot-and-stick approach. \nPoilievre also promised to remove federal taxes on newly constructed homes in an effort to cut costs to would-be homebuyers. Critics, however, say this policy may have minimal effect, as most homes purchased in Canada are resold, rather than brand new.\nVoters who spoke to the BBC say they welcome any plan to ramp up housing construction in Canada.\nWhile much of housing is governed by provinces and cities, Ms Dovgal notes that the federal government has an ability \"to lead persuasively\" and implement measures that make it cheaper and easier to build across the country. \nBut others watching the issue closely caution that the steps proposed may not be enough. \nPaul Kershaw, a public policy professor at UBC and founder of think tank Generation Squeeze, argues that politicians have failed to address the elephant in the room: the wealth older homeowners have generated off the housing crisis.\n\"The political bargain has asked younger Canadians to suffer higher rents and mortgages in order to protect those higher home values,\" Kershaw notes.\n\"None of the parties are really naming that generational tension,\" he says, adding that politicians may privately feel there is a political risk in trying to stall the cost of housing, and thus, older Canadians' assets.\nProf Kershaw calls this a \"cultural problem\", and says that parties should also focus on reducing costs for younger people as a way to alleviate this generational burden.\nFixing the housing crisis, he argues, is just as integral as asserting sovereignty and prosperity in the face of threats posed by Trump's tariffs.\nThe \"dysfunction that has entered our housing market is disruptive to the well-being of the country\", he says. \nUntil a fix is found, the possibility of homeownership still looks bleak for many. \nMs Dovgal contends half-heartedly that, other than moving elsewhere, \"you have to win the lottery, or marry a multi-millionaire. These are kind of the options\".",

        "article_text": "Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.\nRice is a staple food for more than half of the global population. It is consumed on a daily basis by more people than either wheat or maize, also known as corn.\nSo it is with some concern that scientists have unveiled a recent finding: that as carbon emissions rise and the Earth continues to warm, so too will arsenic levels in rice.\nThe presence of arsenic in rice has long been known as a problem. Almost all rice contains arsenic. The harmful, naturally occurring chemical can accumulate in the soil of paddy fields, leaching into the grains of rice grown there. But the amounts found in rice grains can vary considerably from well below the recommended limits set by regulatory bodies to several times higher.\nYet, consuming even low amounts of inorganic arsenic through food or drinking water can lead to cancers and a range of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nResearchers around the world have been working on ways to reduce the levels of arsenic in rice \u2013 and in the meantime, there are ways of cooking it that can extract some of this harmful element from grains (see the box further down the story for more).\nBut a new study of inorganic arsenic accumulation has found it may become a greater problem due to climate change. The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.\nThey found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.\n\"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health \u2013 it's a long laundry list,\" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. \"And two metrics of climate change \u2013 the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures \u2013 are resulting in greater amounts.\"\nIt's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions \"business as usual\" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.\nWhile the researchers focused on locations in China for their experiments, they say such impacts are likely to be seen in rice grown in regions including Europe and the US too, as inorganic arsenic is common in rice grown around the world.\n\"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature \u2013 but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us,\" says Ziska.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 Saving Italy's polluted sea\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\nOf course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice \u2013 so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.\nStill, this is \"one of the most comprehensive studies\" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study. \"This is as robust as you\u2019re ever likely to get.\"\nHumans have known for hundreds of years that arsenic is toxic. Its tasteless, colourless, odourless nature even made it a preferred method for dispatching enemies in the courts of ancient Rome and medieval Europe. But in single doses at trace amounts, it does not cause poisoning.\nOver the last few decades scientists have discovered that even lower amounts of arsenic can cause health impacts when exposure happens chronically over a lifetime.\nThis is particularly true of inorganic arsenic, which is more readily able to attach to biomolecules in the human body where it can cause harm. While naturally occurring in rocks and soils, inorganic arsenic can be a byproduct of activities like mining, coal burning and other industrial processes. (Read more about why \"natural\" doesn\u2019t always mean better).\nThis means inorganic arsenic is particularly prevalent in the groundwater in a number of regions, including South America and parts of southern and central Asia. But people elsewhere are vulnerable too: in the US, for example, more than 7% of private well owners, or 2.1 million people, are drinking dangerous levels of inorganic arsenic. Worldwide, some 140 million people drink water with arsenic levels above the WHO-recommended guidelines.\u00a0\nAnd, outside of drinking water, the main source of dietary exposure to arsenic worldwide is rice. In regions that tend to have little arsenic in their groundwater, like Europe, rice is the single biggest source of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.\nLowering the arsenic in your rice\nIf you want to lower your arsenic exposure from rice, there are a few things you can do.\nFirst, some types of rice have more inorganic arsenic than others. White rice has a lower inorganic arsenic content than brown rice but has less nutritional value. Basmati rice has less inorganic arsenic than other varieties. And rice from certain areas, including east Africa, has less arsenic than rice from other areas, including parts of the US, Europe, and south-east Asia.\nResearchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK also recently discovered a way of cooking rice that can remove 50% of the arsenic in brown rice and 74% from white rice. They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.\nThe UK's Food Standard's Agency recommends rinsing your rice before cooking and then boiling it in six parts water to one part rice before draining and rinsing again.\nThe problem comes down to how around 75% of the world's supply of rice is grown, says Ziska \u2013 in irrigated paddy fields.\nRice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. \"That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe,\" Ziska says. \"But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil.\" In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate reactions with other minerals in the soil that make the arsenic more bioavailable and easier for the rice plants to absorb through their root systems.\n\"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own,\" Ziska says. It changes the microbiome of the soil in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.\nAnd this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. \"This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active,\" Ziska says. \"It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy.\"\nZiska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.\nWhat worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment of inorganic arsenic's \"cancer potency factor\", taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that \"arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed\", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the risk of skin cancer, but lung and bladder cancers.\nAside from cancer, inorganic arsenic raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes. When consumed by pregnant women, it also makes foetal or infant mortality more likely, as well as raises the risk that the infant will be born low birth weight \u2013 which can have lifelong health impacts such as cardiovascular disease \u2013 or have developmental neurocognitive effects.\nFor individuals, the risks are slight. For example, the latest EPA review found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day \u2013 or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person \u2013 would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.\nBut across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.\nInorganic arsenic\nIf everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, the EPA calculates that \u2013 compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic \u2013 an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.\nThe amount of inorganic arsenic in rice varies enormously. But one study found that the global median amount is 66 micrograms per kg of rice. The EU set a limit in 2023 on inorganic arsenic in rice at 200 micrograms per kg of rice.\nSo, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?\n\"We can't pretend that we're going to take rice off the table. That's not feasible,\" says Nachman. As well as an important food tradition, rice is important to people living in poverty, some of whom get up to half of their daily calories from rice alone. \"But we need to do something differently.\"\nResearchers have also been experimenting with whether different types of water management could reduce arsenic levels. One process \u2013 where, instead of flooding a field continuously, the field is partly flooded, drained and then flooded again \u2013 does seem to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic. \"But that just increases cadmium,\" Marham says. \"And cadmium is perceived as an even bigger threat.\" Cadmium can cause breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancers, as well as liver and kidney disease.\nThere is also interest in trying to breed varieties of rice that take up less inorganic arsenic, but this hasn't yet panned out, researchers say.\nBecause some types of rice accumulate less inorganic arsenic, there is interest in exploring their cultivation. Another solution might be adding sulphur to water, which can absorb electrons, like arsenic. Another way to shift the microbiome of fields could be adding certain types of fertiliser \u2013 one combination found to decrease arsenic content has been a mix of mountain thyme and bird manure. But more research on any of these approaches is needed.\nAnother approach may be to grow rice under rainwater-fed conditions, or where both the soil and irrigation water are lower in arsenic. Rice from East Africa, which tends to be rainwater- rather than irrigation-fed, has been found to be particularly low in inorganic arsenic, as has rice in Indonesia. Rice grown in the US, Central and South America, south-east Asia, Europe and Australia all have been found to have higher amounts of arsenic.\nThere also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say. \"Policymakers have been dragging their feet for decades on this,\" says Marham.\u00a0\nCurrently, the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate arsenic levels in rice but has set a limit of 0.1mg/kg of rice intended for consumption by children. In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.\n\"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown,\" Ziska says. \"It really needs attention, because it affects so many individuals globally.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "But the amounts found in rice grains can vary considerably from well below the recommended limits set by regulatory bodies to several times higher.Yet, consuming even low amounts of inorganic arsenic through food or drinking water can lead to cancers and a range of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Researchers around the world have been working on ways to reduce the levels of arsenic in rice \u2013 and in the meantime, there are ways of cooking it that can extract some of this harmful element from grains (see the box further down the story for more).But a new study of inorganic arsenic accumulation has found it may become a greater problem due to climate change. In regions that tend to have little arsenic in their groundwater, like Europe, rice is the single biggest source of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.Lowering the arsenic in your riceIf you want to lower your arsenic exposure from rice, there are a few things you can do.First, some types of rice have more inorganic arsenic than others. \"Ziska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.Getty ImagesParboiling rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining can help reduce arsenic levels (Credit: Getty Images)What worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be.

And rice from certain areas, including east Africa, has less arsenic than rice from other areas, including parts of the US, Europe, and south-east Asia.Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK also recently discovered a way of cooking rice that can remove 50% of the arsenic in brown rice and 74% from white rice.",

        "article_text": "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.\n\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.\nLucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.\nLucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.\nThe condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.\nLucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.\nThe abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.\n\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.\nThis is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.\nWithout medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.\nShe pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"\nAnd that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.\nIt is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.\nIn 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.\nIt is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.\n\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\" \nLucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.\nShe says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.\n\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"\nIP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.\n\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"\nIn response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.\nBut Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.\n\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.\n\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"\n\nLucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.\nNHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.\n\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"\nHer health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.\n\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"\nOnce she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.\nShe will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.\nOver a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.\nMeanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.\nThe embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.\nLucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.\n\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"\nA few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.\n\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.\n\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"\nYou can listen to Lucy Edwards on BBC Access All on BBC Sounds.

        "summary": "'Why I want an IVF baby to screen out gene that made me go blind'2 days agoShareSaveBeth RoseBBC Access AllShareSaveRNIBAs well as an influencer, author, broadcaster and RNIB ambassador, Lucy Edwards is hoping to become a mum Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind. \"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. \"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. \"Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. \"In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.But Lucy says responses have been different around the world.",

        "article_text": "The Israeli military has said \"professional failures\" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month.\nAn inquiry into the incident by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) found a series of failings, including an \"operational misunderstanding\" and a \"breach of orders\".\nThe deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed \"for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief\".\nA spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said the report was \"invalid\" as it \"justifies and shifts the responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different\". \nFourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed on 23 March after a convoy of PRCS ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck came under fire by the Israeli military.\nIn a statement, the IDF said its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces. \nThe IDF said its investigation found six of the casualties were Hamas members, and rejected that there had been summary executions.\nIn an on-the-record briefing, Major General Yoav Har-Even - who investigated the incident - told journalists that the Israeli military maintained that six of the emergency workers were Hamas operatives and said they would later be named. \nThe report said the incident took place in what it called a \"hostile and dangerous combat zone\", and that the commander on the ground perceived an immediate and tangible threat after vehicles approached rapidly. \nIt blamed \"poor night visibility\", which the IDF said meant the commander did not identify the vehicles as ambulances.\nAnother commanding officer \"will receive a reprimand\" for \"his overall responsibility for the incident\", the report added.\nJournalists invited to Sunday's military briefing were shown aerial footage, shot in the early hours of 23 March, which showed the attacks. The footage also showed several other vehicles, including an ambulance, passed by in the hour or so between the first and second Israeli attack, without being shot at. \nIsraeli officials said this proved troops in Gaza did not open fire on medical vehicles unless they felt threatened.\nA UN official in Gaza suggested the IDF investigation did not go far enough. \"A lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place,\" said Jonathan Whittall. \n\"Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all, eroding.\"\nIsrael originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached \"suspiciously\" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army.\nBut it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of a medic who was killed showed the vehicles with their lights on and their emergency signals flashing.\nThe footage shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when shooting begins just before dawn.\nThe video continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles.\nIt also shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wearing reflective hi-vis uniform.\nThe bodies of the 15 dead workers were buried in sand. They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.\nThe IDF also confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic it had detained following the incident. They did not confirm his name, but the International Committee of the Red Cross has previously named him as Assad al-Nassasra. \nThe Red Crescent and several other international organisations have previously called for an independent investigation into the incident.\nThe IDF's decision to fire a commander and discipline another senior officer is not unheard of - the military dismissed two officers and took action against others after seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen were killed in April of last year.\nIsrael launched its first major operation in Rafah in May 2024, leaving large parts of it in ruins. Tens of thousands of people returned to what was left of their homes in the city during a recent two-month-long ceasefire.\nIsrael renewed its offensive in Gaza on 18 March after the first phase of the ceasefire deal came to an end and negotiations on a second phase of the deal stalled.\nIsrael launched its campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 51,201 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

        "article_text": "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted. \nEarlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.\nActors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.\nTheir performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.\nPerhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era. \nOn the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double). \nBut on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".\nSo should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?\nBeatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism. \n\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief. \n\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"\nDu Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.\n\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"\nBut he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.\n\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"\nSo does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?\nDu Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch. \n\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"\nEdda Sharpe, a Merseyside-based voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.\nAmong them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.\nBeatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it. \nThe performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.\n\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.\n\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"\nShe said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.\nBut she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.\n\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.\n\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"\nDr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.\nHe said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.\n\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.\n\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.\n\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"\nBut what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films? \nMichael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.\nHawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can. \n\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.\n\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.\n\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"\nThe 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.\nHe added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.\n\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Washington and Kyiv are moving closer to signing a deal involving Ukraine's mineral deposits, almost two months after President Volodymyr Zelensky first travelled to the US to finalise it - but failed to do so.\nDetails are still emerging about what the latest version of the agreement would include, but previous leaks suggest it may include control of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, oil and gas, in addition to minerals.\nA signed memorandum of intent, published by the Ukrainian government on 18 April, says the countries intend to set up an investment fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine as part of an economic partnership. Kyiv and Washington aim to finalise the text by 26 April, the memo says.\nThe initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but it was derailed after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Zelensky turned into a public shouting match.\nThe memo released on Friday contains broad statements, saying the US and Ukraine \"intend to establish a reconstruction investment fund as part of an economic partnership between the two peoples and governments\".\nIt provides no detail as to how this fund would work, nor does it mention the word \"minerals\" at all.\nIt also does not include the promise of a security guarantee from the US, something Zelensky has pushed hard for throughout negotiations.\nTrump, for his part, has suggested a deal could act as compensation for US military aid given to Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. \nThe memo does not explicitly frame the agreement in this way, but it does make note of the US's \"significant financial and material support\" for Ukraine.\nUkrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko acknowledged the text of the final document was still being worked on, but said she expected the deal to be \"very beneficial for both countries\".\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal previously said the fund would be managed by Kyiv and Washington on \"equal terms\".\nClues about the agreement might be found in previous leaks, as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the current deal was \"substantially what we'd agreed on previously\".\n\"When the president [Zelensky] was here, we had a memorandum of understanding,\" said Bessent, who signed the memo over a video call with Svyrydenko.\n\"We went straight to the big deal, and I think it's an 80-page agreement and that's what we'll be signing,\" he added.\nThe text prepared in February was never officially shared, but a version was published by Ukrainian media ahead of Zelensky's meeting with Trump.\nIt envisaged Ukraine contributing 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to an investment fund, which would be used \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\". \nIt also said the US would \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nSince that draft was published, multiple sources have told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the updated version would be different.\nThe extent of this change, though, remains unclear.\nDisagreement over the terms formed part of a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky, days before he travelled to Washington to sign it.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but this demand was dropped from the version published online.\nFriday's memo says the final agreement was still being worked out, with Shmyhal due to visit Washington next week to conclude \"technical discussions\".\nZelensky has long called for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nFriday's signed memo does not promise such a guarantee.\nIt does, however, say that both the Kyiv and Washington \"desire a lasting peace in Ukraine\".\nThe version of the deal published in February says the US \"supports Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees\" but does not promise one explicitly.  \nTrump has suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act in itself as a security guarantee, but responsibility for Ukraine's security would now fall to Europe.\nThe US president has previously said Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals.\nBoth countries aim to complete discussions by 26 April, with the aim of signing a final deal \"as soon as possible\", according to the memo.\nTrump has said he hopes to sign the deal sooner, by 24 April.\n\"We have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday... next Thursday. Soon. And I assume they're going to live up to the deal. So we'll see. But we have a deal on that,\" he said this week.\nTrump had previously said he and Zelensky would sign the deal during February's meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said a final version of the agreement had been prepared ahead of that meeting, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead descended into a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Svyrydenko, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's land mass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC.\nBefore the deal was supposed to be signed in February, Vladimir Putin told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.",

        "summary": "Trump has suggested the presence of US contractors in Ukraine would act in itself as a security guarantee, but responsibility for Ukraine's security would now fall to Europe.The US president has previously said Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals.Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?When will the deal be signed?Both countries aim to complete discussions by 26 April, with the aim of signing a final deal \"as soon as possible\", according to the memo.Trump has said he hopes to sign the deal sooner, by 24 April. It also said the US would \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".Since that draft was published, multiple sources have told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the updated version would be different.The extent of this change, though, remains unclear.Disagreement over the terms formed part of a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky, days before he travelled to Washington to sign it.The Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but this demand was dropped from the version published online.Friday's memo says the final agreement was still being worked out, with Shmyhal due to visit Washington next week to conclude \"technical discussions\".Does the deal include a security guarantee?Zelensky has long called for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.Friday's signed memo does not promise such a guarantee.It does, however, say that both the Kyiv and Washington \"desire a lasting peace in Ukraine\".The version of the deal published in February says the US \"supports Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees\" but does not promise one explicitly. Kyiv and Washington aim to finalise the text by 26 April, the memo says.The initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but it was derailed after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Zelensky turned into a public shouting match.What are the terms of the latest deal?The memo released on Friday contains broad statements, saying the US and Ukraine \"intend to establish a reconstruction investment fund as part of an economic partnership between the two peoples and governments\".It provides no detail as to how this fund would work, nor does it mention the word \"minerals\" at all.It also does not include the promise of a security guarantee from the US, something Zelensky has pushed hard for throughout negotiations.Trump, for his part, has suggested a deal could act as compensation for US military aid given to Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. But we have a deal on that,\" he said this week.Trump had previously said he and Zelensky would sign the deal during February's meeting at the White House.Ukrainian PM Shmyhal said a final version of the agreement had been prepared ahead of that meeting, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said only a framework agreement was due to be signed.But nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead descended into a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office.At one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".He said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.

Humans are tired... you kind of know that your personal bias is entering in to your marking,\" he added.\nDave Costen, digital lead for Elizabeth College, said AI was not yet able to substitute for teaching.\nMr Costen said one difference was AI gave \"too much [information] to students straight away\" whereas teachers \"develop the learning [of students] gradually\".\nStudents generally have a poor understanding of AI, he said.\nDespite this, some Elizabeth College students had experimented with the technology, he said. \nOne student explained to the BBC that AI was not good at adjusting the difficulty of example questions. \nAnother student said some of their peers over-relied on AI, and used it to complete work for them, which was not helping them learn.\nAI was also better at some subjects than others, a third explained. It was very strong at coding, but in subjects that required reasoning it \"really struggled\".\nParent Gazz Barbe said he uses parental controls to restrict his daughter's phone use, and added that he did not allow the use of AI technology. \n\"I worry that if I give my daughter unrestricted access to this technology, she will use it to complete homework assignments. \n\"And if she does this in a subject that she really struggles with, she could easily become over-reliant on the technology,\" he said.\n\"The positive potential is absolutely massive... so long as it's used as a tool to assist teachers instead of doing the teaching,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

But today I think of him as my player. When he is ready he is facing the competition in the team because he is ready to play.\n\"You don't know. Amass did really well today. Chido when he played, did quite well. It is a difficult moment and not the right moment for the kids to play. But if we have to do it, we will.\"\nIt is not known yet whether senior defenders Noussair Mazraoui or Victor Lindelof will be involved against Wolves.\nMazraoui was taken off at half-time and Lindelof had a planned substitute appearance scrapped after they were alerted independently to medical issues at home.\n\"It was the same for both,\" he said. \n\"Sometimes you don't control these things but everything is OK now.

These restrictions will rise incrementally over the following 22 years.\nThe announcement came as global trade is already being disrupted by Trump's trade tariffs, experts have said.\nCargoes originally destined for ports in the US from China are instead being redirected to European ports, a trade group said.\nBusinesses have warned this will raise prices for US consumers.\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.\nHis administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nThese tariffs have caused \"significant build ups\" of ships, especially in the European Union, but also \"significant congestion\" at UK ports, according to Marco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade.\nMore containers are coming to the UK, he said.\n\"We've seen a lot of diversion of ships from China, that were due to head to the US, diverting and coming to the UK and into the EU.\"\nIn the first three months of 2025, Chinese imports into the UK have increased by about 15% and into the EU by about 12%.\n\"That's a direct impact of what President Trump is doing,\" he said, adding that uncertainty and increased disruption pushes up prices for consumers.\nSanne Manders, president of logistics firm Flexport, said both tariffs and strikes at ports in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium in the first three months of the year had been \"clogging\" ports.\nCongestion in the UK \"is particularly severe in Felixstowe\", while in continental Europe Rotterdam and Barcelona are \"also pretty severe\".\n\"I do believe that if more cargo is going to be routed towards Europe, finding new buyers that will drive up the volumes even further, that could lead to more congestion,\" he said - although terminals would be open for more hours per day in the summer due to better weather.\nHe said shippers were looking for new markets, but that also there may be a surge of goods to the US to try to take advantage of that 90-day window for goods from some countries.\nHe said in the US, consumers would pay for the tariffs, but European consumers would not see \"much impact\".\nCompanies would also probably start redesigning their supply chains, he said.",

        "article_text": "Artists and creatives are pushing back against a recent trend using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate \"starter pack\" images of people as toys - which they say may be in danger of risking their livelihoods.\nSince the start of April, thousands of people have uploaded their photos to generate images of themselves as dolls, despite warnings of damaging the environment, giving away personal information, and devaluing creativity.\nNick Lavallee, who has made custom action figures for six years, told the BBC he was concerned his work may be at risk after \"AI images saturated social media\".\n\"People are sick of them,\" he said. \"It's an artistic aesthetic - AI-generated art diminishes that.\"\nNick has made figures of - and for - comedians, film directors, and artists such as Weezer and Tyler Childers, which sell for as much as $250 (\u00a3188) online on his Wicked Joyful website.\nHis success has led to a clothing brand and will soon be followed by a physical shop in his hometown of Manchester, New Hampshire.\nBut he's concerned action figure commissions could soon dry up, as well as the public perception of his work, from thousands of AI images mimicking his passion.\nThe feeling has been shared by other creatives with the rise of the #StarterPackNoAI movement, which has been used thousands of times since first appearing on Instagram in early April before spreading to X soon after.\nAfter Patouret's post, others quickly joined the counter-trend, with artist Maria Picass\u00f3 Piquer saying she chose to take part \"for fun, but also as a statement\".\n\"While AI pieces all looked more or less the same, I was amazed at the variety of the 'human' works,\" she said.\n\"Plus, self-portraits added an extra layer of, well, humanity.\"\nMaria, like many other artists, sees the dual risk of AI images threatening intellectual property rights by being \"fed on 'stolen' art\", and the possibility of reducing her finding new clients.\nIllustrator Dav le Dessineux, working in Bordeaux, France, said some in his industry had already lost contracts to AI design work.\nHe contributed his starter\u00a0pack because \"like many artists who use their real hands\", he was \"tired\" of the deluge of AI-generated doll images.\nDav's illustration featured only a pencil and sheet of white paper - tools he said are \"all you need to start being an artist\".\n\"People usually forget about it because of the technology surrounding us, but we really don't need more than basic stuff to create something and be original,\" he said.\nEli Dibitonto, an artist living in Barletta, Italy, agreed, describing the process of digitally illustrating his own starter pack as \"carefree and fun\".\n\"It doesn't have to be perfect - mine isn't,\" he said. \"Art isn't meant to be perfect or look flawless.\"\nAnd illustrator and student Evie Joyce said creating her own artwork meant being able to consider what to reflect of her personality during a process lasting several hours, rather than seconds.\n\"I think that what's so magical about it is you're seeing people put time and effort and their personality, all of their experiences, into pieces of art,\" she said.\n\"With AI, it can even steal from artists and steal their work and their style, it just loses that touch of personality.\"\nBack in New Hampshire, Nick understands the rebellion from illustrators, but says he believes there is use for AI.\n\"I don't necessarily want to say AI is bad when I know that it could be a useful tool,\" he said.\n\"I think all of us have experimented with it.\"\nAnd Henk van Ess, a global expert in using AI in investigative research, has proven how useful it can be - but it would be safe to say he does not believe it lies in starter packs.\n\"It's like watching a supercomputer calculate how many Hobnobs fit in a Sports Direct mug, while solving climate change sits on the 'to-do' list,\" he said.\n\"Technically impressive? Sure. But it's the technological equivalent of using the Large Hadron Collider to heat up your Pot Noodle.\n\"While everyone's busy generating these digital equivalents of small talk, they're missing the actually revolutionary stuff AI can do - it's just wasteful to put all that energy into creating digital fluff when we can use it for solving real-world problems.\"\nAnd Nick remains positive.\n\"The musicians who get my stuff, who are excited to hold a Wicked Joyful in their hands, they know it's my artwork, they know it's mine,\" he said.\nLikewise, Dav is confident in the worth of human work.\nDespite the rise of pre-fabricated furniture, he says, \"people still call on cabinetmakers\".\n\"I hope I'll be one of those artisans,\" he said.\nNick, who says he found his purpose \"in bringing joy to people\" with his creations, said he similarly wanted to remain hopeful about the future.\n\"I really hope people are totally sick of AI action figures,\" he said.\n\"But I hope that they are smart enough to understand the difference in something that I'm doing versus what is computer-generated.\"",

Those exits had seemed likely but the sale of talented forward Georginio Rutter to Brighton after the season had started was unexpected and unwelcome.\nStill, the Whites boasted a strong squad for the level and the permanent additions of Spurs defender Joe Rodon after his loan last season, ex-Sheffield United full-back Jayden Bogle and Japan international midfielder Ao Tanaka, plus the loan signings of Joe Rothwell and Manor Solomon from Bournemouth and Tottenham respectively, all brought quality.\nOn the pitch the campaign started with no wins from their first three games in all competitions but they kickstarted things with a 2-0 victory at Sheffield Wednesday and scarcely looked back.\nDespite a narrow home defeat by fellow promotion hopefuls Burnley on 14 September, to date their only loss at Elland Road this season, by the third international break of the season in November, Leeds had risen up to second.\nAfter ending that month with a 1-0 home defeat at Blackburn they then went on a three-month unbeaten run in the league that included a 7-0 demolition of Cardiff and dramatic comebacks to beat top-four rivals Sunderland and Sheffield United on successive Mondays in February.\nThe victory over the Blades left them five points clear at the top and, with a seemingly favourable run of fixtures until the end of the campaign, promotion looked inevitable.\nHowever, March brought just one win from five and the 2-2 draw with Swansea saw Farke drop goalkeeper Illan Meslier for Karl Darlow after the Frenchman, who had also made costly errors in draws at Sunderland and Hull City, gifted the Welsh side their first equaliser.\nThe German boss was then criticised by some after saying the point from the 1-1 draw at lowly Luton in the next game was a good result but it proved to be the case as the Blades totally lost their way with three successive defeats and the Whites went from third back to first and five points clear of Chris Wilder's men in third with three games to play.\nSix moments that mattered as Leeds won promotion\nLeeds players celebrated with the fans after Monday's 6-0 win over Stoke had left them on the cusp of promotion\nMonday's demolition of struggling Stoke meant that, thanks to a vastly superior goal difference, a point from their final two matches would have been enough to go up but even that was not needed thanks to Burnley's win.\nFarke, who had chosen not to make any further signings in the January transfer window, is now closing in on a third title at this level after winning two with Norwich.\nA huge summer awaits as Leeds look to buck the worrying trend that appears set to see all of the past six teams promoted to the Premier League go straight back down.\nPlans to avoid that fate will now truly begin in earnest on Tuesday but for now Farke and the Leeds fans, robbed of being able to properly celebrate their last promotion to the top flight in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, can enjoy a job well done.\nLatest Leeds United news, analysis and fan views\nFollow Leeds United in the BBC Sport app\nListen to the latest Don't Go To Bed Just Yet podcast",

Those exits had seemed likely but the sale of talented forward Georginio Rutter to Brighton after the season had started was unexpected and unwelcome.Still, the Whites boasted a strong squad for the level and the permanent additions of Spurs defender Joe Rodon after his loan last season, ex-Sheffield United full-back Jayden Bogle and Japan international midfielder Ao Tanaka, plus the loan signings of Joe Rothwell and Manor Solomon from Bournemouth and Tottenham respectively, all brought quality.On the pitch the campaign started with no wins from their first three games in all competitions but they kickstarted things with a 2-0 victory at Sheffield Wednesday and scarcely looked back.Despite a narrow home defeat by fellow promotion hopefuls Burnley on 14 September, to date their only loss at Elland Road this season, by the third international break of the season in November, Leeds had risen up to second.After ending that month with a 1-0 home defeat at Blackburn they then went on a three-month unbeaten run in the league that included a 7-0 demolition of Cardiff and dramatic comebacks to beat top-four rivals Sunderland and Sheffield United on successive Mondays in February.The victory over the Blades left them five points clear at the top and, with a seemingly favourable run of fixtures until the end of the campaign, promotion looked inevitable.However, March brought just one win from five and the 2-2 draw with Swansea saw Farke drop goalkeeper Illan Meslier for Karl Darlow after the Frenchman, who had also made costly errors in draws at Sunderland and Hull City, gifted the Welsh side their first equaliser.The German boss was then criticised by some after saying the point from the 1-1 draw at lowly Luton in the next game was a good result but it proved to be the case as the Blades totally lost their way with three successive defeats and the Whites went from third back to first and five points clear of Chris Wilder's men in third with three games to play.Six moments that mattered as Leeds won promotionPublished2 hours agoImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Leeds players celebrated with the fans after Monday's 6-0 win over Stoke had left them on the cusp of promotionMonday's demolition of struggling Stoke meant that, thanks to a vastly superior goal difference, a point from their final two matches would have been enough to go up but even that was not needed thanks to Burnley's win.Farke, who had chosen not to make any further signings in the January transfer window, is now closing in on a third title at this level after winning two with Norwich.A huge summer awaits as Leeds look to buck the worrying trend that appears set to see all of the past six teams promoted to the Premier League go straight back down.Plans to avoid that fate will now truly begin in earnest on Tuesday but for now Farke and the Leeds fans, robbed of being able to properly celebrate their last promotion to the top flight in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, can enjoy a job well done.Related topicsChampionshipFootballLeeds UnitedMore on this storyLatest Leeds United news, analysis and fan viewsFollow Leeds United in the BBC Sport appPublished26 July 2022Listen to the latest Don't Go To Bed Just Yet podcast",

        "article_text": "The US has revealed plans to impose port fees on Chinese ships to try to revive shipbuilding in America and challenge China's dominance of the industry.\nFrom mid-October, Chinese ship-owners and operators will be charged $50 per ton of cargo with the fees increasing each year for the next three years.\nThere have been concerns that the measures would further disrupt global trade after US President Donald Trump's raft of tariff policies, but the fee is less severe than originally suggested.\nA spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said the fees will raise prices for American consumers and \"will not revitalise the US shipbuilding industry\".\nThe US Trade Representative (USTR) said: \"China has largely achieved its dominance goals, severely disadvantaging US companies, workers, and the US economy\".\nFees on Chinese vessel owners and operators of ships built in China will be based on the weight of their cargo, how many containers they carry or the number of vehicles onboard.\nFor affected bulk vessels, the fee will be based on the weight of their cargo, while the charge for container ships will depend on how many containers a vessel is carrying.\nThe $50 per ton of cargo will rise by $30 a ton each year for the next three years. Fees on Chinese-built ships will start at $18 a ton or $120 per container and also rise over the next three years.\nNon-US built ships carrying cars will be charged $150 per vehicle.\nThe fee will be applied once per voyage on affected ships and not more than five times a year.\nThe USTR also decided not to impose fees based on how many Chinese-built ships are in a fleet or based on prospective orders of Chinese ships, as it had originally proposed.\nEmpty vessels that arrive at US ports to carry bulk exports like coal or grain are exempted.\nVessels that move goods between American ports as well as from those ports to Caribbean islands and US territories are also exempted from rules, as are US and Canadian ships that call at ports in the Great Lakes.\nThe fees are much lower than a plan floated in February to charge up to $1.5m (\u00a31.1m) for each American port a Chinese ship visits.\nThe USTR said a second phase of actions will begin in three years to favour US-built ships carrying liquified natural gas (LNG). These restrictions will rise incrementally over the following 22 years.\nThe announcement came as global trade is already being disrupted by Trump's trade tariffs, experts have said.\nCargoes originally destined for ports in the US from China are instead being redirected to European ports, a trade group said.\nBusinesses have warned this will raise prices for US consumers.\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.\nHis administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nThese tariffs have caused \"significant build ups\" of ships, especially in the European Union, but also \"significant congestion\" at UK ports, according to Marco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade.\nMore containers are coming to the UK, he said.\n\"We've seen a lot of diversion of ships from China, that were due to head to the US, diverting and coming to the UK and into the EU.\"\nIn the first three months of 2025, Chinese imports into the UK have increased by about 15% and into the EU by about 12%.\n\"That's a direct impact of what President Trump is doing,\" he said, adding that uncertainty and increased disruption pushes up prices for consumers.\nSanne Manders, president of logistics firm Flexport, said both tariffs and strikes at ports in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium in the first three months of the year had been \"clogging\" ports.\nCongestion in the UK \"is particularly severe in Felixstowe\", while in continental Europe Rotterdam and Barcelona are \"also pretty severe\".\n\"I do believe that if more cargo is going to be routed towards Europe, finding new buyers that will drive up the volumes even further, that could lead to more congestion,\" he said - although terminals would be open for more hours per day in the summer due to better weather.\nHe said shippers were looking for new markets, but that also there may be a surge of goods to the US to try to take advantage of that 90-day window for goods from some countries.\nHe said in the US, consumers would pay for the tariffs, but European consumers would not see \"much impact\".\nCompanies would also probably start redesigning their supply chains, he said.",

And that's not allowing me to do as good of a job this year,\" Norris said.\n\"It's not that I'm doing a bad job, it's just I'm not able to be at the level I should be, and know I can be and want to be.\n\"In order to perform better, I'm being forced to drive in a different way, in a different manner that I'm not used to.

Although the Australian was quicker in both the second and third sectors, the Dutchman had done enough to grab pole.\nVerstappen said: \"I definitely didn't expect to be on pole here but the car came alive in the night and it was a lot more enjoyable to drive. The grip was coming to me. Around here a qualifying lap is extremely difficult. It is really satisfying.\n\"Tomorrow in the race it will be tough to keep them behind but we are going to give it a good go.\"\nNorris did not want to speak about his crash in interviews after qualifying\nPiastri said: \"Max has done a good job, another high-speed circuit for them, where they seem to have a little more success. Our pace is good. It's going to be a tough race, the tyres are softer than last year and we'll see if that plays to our advantage.\"\nNorris will have to rely on the strong race pace of the McLaren to try to limit the damage to his championship position, as he starts the race three points clear of Piastri and eight in front of Verstappen.\nHis accident was caused by him misjudging the entry to the chicane at Turns Four and Five. The car oversteered on to the kerb at Five and was flicked into the wall on the exit, damaging the left-hand side of the car.\nHe swore over the radio that he was an \"idiot\", but was unhurt.\n\"Disappointed but I'm fine,\" Norris said. \"The team have a lot of work to do. It has been such a smooth positive weekend so far, so I'm disappointed to have such big setback. But have to take it on the chin, and try and go again tomorrow.\n\"The car is quick. It has been quick all weekend, so I have to work hard to overtake the cars tomorrow.\"\nRussell said he had \"mixed feelings\" because he felt there was more in his car, adding that he rued Mercedes' decision not to use the same strategy as Red Bull after the red flag.\nAt Ferrari, Hamilton's travails this season continued, underlined by the statistic that he has only once so far qualified higher than the seventh place he managed this weekend.\n\"I've been nowhere all weekend,\" Hamilton said. \"I am happier than I was yesterday. It really wasn't coming easy, so P7 is OK. I still have work to do to try to gel with this car.\"",

His family and attorneys have fiercely denied he is a member of MS-13. \nVan Hollen said he was initially blocked from meeting Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by Salvadoran authorities. Later, he said government officials helped facilitate a meeting and Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was brought to the senator's hotel.\n\"His conversation with me was the first communication that he had with anybody outside of prison since he was abducted,\" Van Hollen said.\n\"He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes.\"\nVan Hollen added that conditions in the new prison, in the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana, were better.\n\"He still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world,\" Van Hollen said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's case is part of a simmering showdown between the Trump administration and the US courts system on the issue of immigration. \nA separate feud has been brewing after a judge said he could hold the Trump administration in contempt for its \"wilful disregard\" of his order barring deportation flights. \nMultiple judges - including a unanimous US Supreme Court ruling - said the government should facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return to the US. But the White House has insisted the Maryland man will \"never\" live in the US again.\n\"If he [Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda] ever ends up back in the United States, he would immediately be deported again,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters at the White House Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was \"not a very innocent guy\".\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has faced at least two other allegations of criminal activity, neither of which resulted in a conviction.\nHis wife alleged in a 2021 protective order request that he'd physically attacked her on multiple occasions, according to documents shared by the US Department of Homeland Security.\nJennifer Vasquez Sura decided not to follow through with the court process, saying she and her husband were \"able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counselling\".\nA separate incident was reported in 2022, when Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was pulled over in Tennessee for allegedly speeding. \nAn officer speculated that he was involved in human trafficking, due to him having multiple people in the car and telling authorities he'd been travelling from Texas to Maryland, according to information shared by the Department of Homeland Security that was obtained by the BBC's partner CBS. \nNo criminal case was launched from the incident. His wife said he \"worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites\". \nAt the heart of the case, though, are the allegations of his involvement in MS-13, which the Trump administration used to expel him under the Alien Enemies Act.\nThe president has evoked the law to deport hundreds so far, by arguing the alleged gang members were terrorists. \nSen Van Hollen said the Trump administration wants to \"flat out lie about what this case is about\". \n\"If you want to make claims about \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, you should present them in the courts, not on social media,\" he said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was arrested by immigration authorities on 12 March in Baltimore, before being deported from Texas to El Salvador on 15 March.

        "article_text": "In a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it \u2013 and that's what makes it magical.\nIn the Sandhills region of North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.\nThe region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.\nPeople largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm \u2013 think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.\nThe prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the \"cradle of American golf\", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.\nHunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and \u2013 the star attraction \u2013 imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nBut travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.\n\"It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,\" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.\nBurns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.\nDon Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (\u00a313) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about \u00a358) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.\nPlan your trip\n- If you\u2019re looking to purchase your own jar of amethyst treasure, keep an eye out online for availability toward late July. Dees Bees Apiary tends to sell in smaller increments so more people have the chance to try it.\n- At other times of year, drop into local shops and farmers' markets to taste the distinct honey varieties grown here, from sourwood to apple blossom to tupelo, and if you\u2019re lucky, some of the purple stuff, too.\n- Visitors can also take a honey tour with Honeybee Bliss, where suited-up guests play honey sommelier and take a turn at pulling bee-laden frames oozing with golden goo.\nDees' take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.\nHowever, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, \"to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way\".\nBurns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. \"One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it.\" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. \"Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.\nThere's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers \u2013 who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff \u2013 can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets \u2013 and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.\nOn Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.\nThe California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\".

Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.\nIn recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.\nBecause its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.\nWashington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.\nUS restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.\nIn 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.\nA more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.\nHowever, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.\nDeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips. \nNow, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.\nThose companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (\u00a34.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.\nChim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei. \nAlthough they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.\n\"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.\nChina is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.\nThe timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.\nIn his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped \"to continue to cooperate with China\", according to state broadcaster CCTV.\nOn Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.\nSeparately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that \"China's market investment and consumption potential is huge\", according to state news agency Xinhua.\nDuring talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.\nThe controls are part of Washington's broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US.\nNvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia's decision.\nAnd in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona.\nGary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between \"two systems\", one dominated by the US and the other by China.\n\"Tech will be less global in that sense, and it will be subject to more restrictions.\"",

        "article_text": "Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.\nRice is a staple food for more than half of the global population. It is consumed on a daily basis by more people than either wheat or maize, also known as corn.\nSo it is with some concern that scientists have unveiled a recent finding: that as carbon emissions rise and the Earth continues to warm, so too will arsenic levels in rice.\nThe presence of arsenic in rice has long been known as a problem. Almost all rice contains arsenic. The harmful, naturally occurring chemical can accumulate in the soil of paddy fields, leaching into the grains of rice grown there. But the amounts found in rice grains can vary considerably from well below the recommended limits set by regulatory bodies to several times higher.\nYet, consuming even low amounts of inorganic arsenic through food or drinking water can lead to cancers and a range of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nResearchers around the world have been working on ways to reduce the levels of arsenic in rice \u2013 and in the meantime, there are ways of cooking it that can extract some of this harmful element from grains (see the box further down the story for more).\nBut a new study of inorganic arsenic accumulation has found it may become a greater problem due to climate change. The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.\nThey found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.\n\"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health \u2013 it's a long laundry list,\" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. \"And two metrics of climate change \u2013 the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures \u2013 are resulting in greater amounts.\"\nIt's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions \"business as usual\" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.\nWhile the researchers focused on locations in China for their experiments, they say such impacts are likely to be seen in rice grown in regions including Europe and the US too, as inorganic arsenic is common in rice grown around the world.\n\"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature \u2013 but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us,\" says Ziska.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 Saving Italy's polluted sea\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\nOf course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice \u2013 so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.\nStill, this is \"one of the most comprehensive studies\" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study. \"This is as robust as you\u2019re ever likely to get.\"\nHumans have known for hundreds of years that arsenic is toxic. Its tasteless, colourless, odourless nature even made it a preferred method for dispatching enemies in the courts of ancient Rome and medieval Europe. But in single doses at trace amounts, it does not cause poisoning.\nOver the last few decades scientists have discovered that even lower amounts of arsenic can cause health impacts when exposure happens chronically over a lifetime.\nThis is particularly true of inorganic arsenic, which is more readily able to attach to biomolecules in the human body where it can cause harm. While naturally occurring in rocks and soils, inorganic arsenic can be a byproduct of activities like mining, coal burning and other industrial processes. (Read more about why \"natural\" doesn\u2019t always mean better).\nThis means inorganic arsenic is particularly prevalent in the groundwater in a number of regions, including South America and parts of southern and central Asia. But people elsewhere are vulnerable too: in the US, for example, more than 7% of private well owners, or 2.1 million people, are drinking dangerous levels of inorganic arsenic. Worldwide, some 140 million people drink water with arsenic levels above the WHO-recommended guidelines.\u00a0\nAnd, outside of drinking water, the main source of dietary exposure to arsenic worldwide is rice. In regions that tend to have little arsenic in their groundwater, like Europe, rice is the single biggest source of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.\nLowering the arsenic in your rice\nIf you want to lower your arsenic exposure from rice, there are a few things you can do.\nFirst, some types of rice have more inorganic arsenic than others. White rice has a lower inorganic arsenic content than brown rice but has less nutritional value. Basmati rice has less inorganic arsenic than other varieties. And rice from certain areas, including east Africa, has less arsenic than rice from other areas, including parts of the US, Europe, and south-east Asia.\nResearchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK also recently discovered a way of cooking rice that can remove 50% of the arsenic in brown rice and 74% from white rice. They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.\nThe UK's Food Standard's Agency recommends rinsing your rice before cooking and then boiling it in six parts water to one part rice before draining and rinsing again.\nThe problem comes down to how around 75% of the world's supply of rice is grown, says Ziska \u2013 in irrigated paddy fields.\nRice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. \"That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe,\" Ziska says. \"But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil.\" In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate reactions with other minerals in the soil that make the arsenic more bioavailable and easier for the rice plants to absorb through their root systems.\n\"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own,\" Ziska says. It changes the microbiome of the soil in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.\nAnd this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. \"This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active,\" Ziska says. \"It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy.\"\nZiska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.\nWhat worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment of inorganic arsenic's \"cancer potency factor\", taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that \"arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed\", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the risk of skin cancer, but lung and bladder cancers.\nAside from cancer, inorganic arsenic raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes. When consumed by pregnant women, it also makes foetal or infant mortality more likely, as well as raises the risk that the infant will be born low birth weight \u2013 which can have lifelong health impacts such as cardiovascular disease \u2013 or have developmental neurocognitive effects.\nFor individuals, the risks are slight. For example, the latest EPA review found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day \u2013 or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person \u2013 would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.\nBut across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.\nInorganic arsenic\nIf everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, the EPA calculates that \u2013 compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic \u2013 an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.\nThe amount of inorganic arsenic in rice varies enormously. But one study found that the global median amount is 66 micrograms per kg of rice. The EU set a limit in 2023 on inorganic arsenic in rice at 200 micrograms per kg of rice.\nSo, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?\n\"We can't pretend that we're going to take rice off the table. That's not feasible,\" says Nachman. As well as an important food tradition, rice is important to people living in poverty, some of whom get up to half of their daily calories from rice alone. \"But we need to do something differently.\"\nResearchers have also been experimenting with whether different types of water management could reduce arsenic levels. One process \u2013 where, instead of flooding a field continuously, the field is partly flooded, drained and then flooded again \u2013 does seem to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic. \"But that just increases cadmium,\" Marham says. \"And cadmium is perceived as an even bigger threat.\" Cadmium can cause breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancers, as well as liver and kidney disease.\nThere is also interest in trying to breed varieties of rice that take up less inorganic arsenic, but this hasn't yet panned out, researchers say.\nBecause some types of rice accumulate less inorganic arsenic, there is interest in exploring their cultivation. Another solution might be adding sulphur to water, which can absorb electrons, like arsenic. Another way to shift the microbiome of fields could be adding certain types of fertiliser \u2013 one combination found to decrease arsenic content has been a mix of mountain thyme and bird manure. But more research on any of these approaches is needed.\nAnother approach may be to grow rice under rainwater-fed conditions, or where both the soil and irrigation water are lower in arsenic. Rice from East Africa, which tends to be rainwater- rather than irrigation-fed, has been found to be particularly low in inorganic arsenic, as has rice in Indonesia. Rice grown in the US, Central and South America, south-east Asia, Europe and Australia all have been found to have higher amounts of arsenic.\nThere also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say. \"Policymakers have been dragging their feet for decades on this,\" says Marham.\u00a0\nCurrently, the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate arsenic levels in rice but has set a limit of 0.1mg/kg of rice intended for consumption by children. In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.\n\"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown,\" Ziska says. \"It really needs attention, because it affects so many individuals globally.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "After decades in prison, Erik and Lyle Menendez have a chance at being resentenced - and possibly freed - in a murder case that still divides America.  \nThe pair, who are serving life in prison for the murder of their parents, appeared in a Los Angeles court via video stream on Thursday as a judge readied to hear arguments whether they should or should not be resentenced at a long-anticipated hearing. \nThe pair are serving life in prison for killing their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, in 1989, when they were 21 and 18. Their case gained renewed attention after a popular Netflix series last year.\nAfter a contentious start to the proceedings on Thursday, the judge ultimately decided to postpone the resentencing hearing until next month. \nThe hearing will determine whether the pair should be resentenced to a lesser penalty. If approved, the brothers could become eligible for parole - potentially allowing their freedom. \nProsecutors have argued Erik and Lyle meticulously planned the killings so they could access their parents' fortune. The current Los Angeles District Attorney says the brothers have continued to cling to lies about the case and should not be freed.\nBut the brothers' lawyers have long argued the killings were an act of self-defence and claimed their father abused them for years. They have also pointed to court filings detailing their rehabilitation during their years behind bars. \nHere is how Thursday's hearing unravelled, what comes next - and a recap of how we got here. \nThe brothers shot and killed their parents with shotguns at their Beverly Hills mansion, but there has long been a debate over their motive.\nProsecutors painted them during their trials as spoiled rich kids who wanted to access their parents' $14m (\u00a310.7m) fortune. They argued that the duo methodically planned the killings, buying shotguns and opening fire on their parents 13 times as the couple watched TV - before going gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees.\nThe brothers ultimately admitted to the killings - but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse by their father Jose, a high-powered film and record label executive. \nThe brothers' trial in 1993 was one of the first high-profile murder cases to be shown live on television, gripping audiences in the US and globally.\nIt ended deadlocked, but in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in a second trial during which the judge barred many of their claims of sexual abuse. They are imprisoned near San Diego.\nThe hearing on Thursday got a contentious start - and ultimately led to the judge postponing the proceedings until next month. \nThe day started with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office making a last-minute request to postpone the hearing so the court could examine a new report done by the state's parole board. \nThe report, a risk assessment, examined whether the brothers pose a risk to the general public if they were to be released on parole. It was done at the request of Gov Gavin Newsom after the brothers asked him for clemency in their case, another avenue Erik and Lyle have been chasing in hopes of being freed from prison. \nThe hearing went forward and attorneys representing the Menendez brothers and the victims' families launched a multi-pronged attack against the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, which is opposing the resentencing effort. \nThey accused prosecutors of violating victims' rights by displaying graphic crime scene images and creating a conflict of interest on the parole board.\nMark Geragos, a high-profile defence attorney representing the brothers, said he would ask for the district attorney's office to be recused.  \nLos Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic defended the prosecutor leading the case, Habib Balian, and the prosecutor apologised for not giving the family a notice about the gruesome photos before they were shown. \nThe judge told attorney Bryan Freedman, who is representing members of the Menendez family vying for their release, that things will come up in these hearings that will be tough for family to see and hear.\n\"If anyone is uncomfortable, they need to think about whether they should be here,\" the judge warned.\nThen after a lunch break, the judge decided he would postpone the proceedings until 9 May so he has time to mull the risk assessment report and the request for the district attorney's office to recuse. \nIf the hearing goes as planned on 9 May, the judge will look at evidence, hear from witnesses, and ultimately determine whether Erik and Lyle should be resentenced. \nIt will not be a re-trial, and guilt will not be a question. Much of the focus is likely to instead be on what the brothers have done during their 30 years in prison. \nThe hearing is not being televised.\nBoth sides - lawyers for the Menendez brothers and the district attorney's office - will be able to call people to testify. \nThis could include a wide variety of individuals, from people involved in prosecuting the brothers in the 1990s or prison officials talking about the brothers' last 30 years behind bars. \nWe are likely to hear from members of the Menendez family, many of whom have become outspoken advocates for Erik and Lyle's release. But at least one member of the family has been a fierce critic of the effort to free them. \nMilton Anderson, who is Kitty Menendez's brother, has called the brothers \"cold-blooded\" and has argued the pair should remain behind bars for the \"heinous act\".\nThe brothers appeared in court on Thursday via a video feed from prison, wearing cobalt blue prison uniforms and matching stern expressions as prosecutors and attorneys haggled over their fate.\nIt is unclear whether they will address the court as part of their resentencing bid. \nIf they did, it would mark a significant moment in the case, and would leave them open to questions from prosecutors who oppose their release.\nThe pair have previously only appeared in court remotely by video link. The BBC has asked whether they will testify. \nOn a recent episode of his podcast, their lawyer Mark Geragos said he had not decided whether to call them to the stand.\n\"I know right now that I'm going to put family members on the stand,\" Mr Geragos said. \"I know right now, I'll put correctional officers on the stand. I know right now I may put behavioural scientists on the stand.\"\nThe district attorney's office has similarly not said who it plans to call to testify. \nAfter the hearing happens and concludes, Judge Jesic will rule on whether the brothers should be resentenced. \nBut it is not clear when that will happen, though.\nThe judge addressed his timing on a decision at Thursday's hearing. \n\"There's no way I'm going to make a decision in the next two days to resentence,\" he told both sides. \nEven if Judge Jesic rules in favour of the brothers being resentenced, they will not be immediately released. \nWhat happens next will depend on what type of sentence the judge offers the brothers. There is a chance they could be given a new, lesser sentence that would make them immediately eligible for parole.\nBut eligibility does not guarantee release; they would still need to convince a state parole board they are no longer a danger to society.\nOr the judge could opt for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.\nThe Menendez brothers filed a motion in 2023 detailing new evidence alleging childhood sexual abuse by their father, and requesting their convictions be vacated.\nThe evidence included an allegation of rape from a former member of boy band Menudo, Roy Rossell\u00f3, and a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin eight months before the murders, which detailed the alleged abuse.\nThe top LA prosecutor at the time, George Gasc\u00f3n, announced that he was supporting the resentencing bid, days before an election in November 2024. He denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long time coming.\nGasc\u00f3n's announcement came shortly after a popular Netflix documentary and TV drama welcomed a new generation to the case. Many of the brothers' supporters suggest that if they were put on trial today, their allegations of abuse would be taken more seriously \u2013 potentially leading to a very different outcome.\nAfter Gasc\u00f3n lost his re-election bid, Nathan Hochman took over the his office and the Menendez case. Hochman came out forcefully against their resentencing request, and said the brothers continued to stick by a litany of \"lies\". \n\"They have not shown full insight into their crimes,\" he said. But Hochman was rebuked by a judge who allowed the resentencing request to move forward. \nThe brothers have been following three paths in an effort to win their freedom. The other two are: ",

        "article_text": "Max Verstappen finished sixth in Bahrain last weekend \nMax Verstappen says he is \"very relaxed\" about his future despite Red Bull's difficult start to the 2025 Formula 1 season.\nFollowing his sixth place at the Bahrain Grand Prix last weekend, Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko told Sky Germany he has \"great concern\" about Verstappen potentially leaving the team. \nThe Dutchman, who is aiming to win a record-equalling fifth consecutive drivers' title this year, is third in the championship, eight points behind leader Lando Norris of McLaren. \nRound five takes place in Saudi Arabia this weekend, with Sunday's race starting at 18:00 BST. \n\"A lot of people are talking about it except me,\" said Verstappen on Thursday. \n\"Like I said before, I just want to focus on my car, work with the people in the team - that's the only thing I'm thinking about in Formula 1 at the moment.\n\"I'm very relaxed.\" \nVerstappen has a contract with Red Bull until 2028. But Marko told BBC Sport this month that it contains a performance clause that could allow him to depart the team.\nThe 27-year-old has been linked with moves to Mercedes and Aston Martin for 2026 when new regulations are being introduced. He held talks with Mercedes last year but their team boss Toto Wolff said at the season-opener in Australia last month that a pitch to sign Verstappen for next season is \"not on any radar\". \nAsked in the drivers' news conference whether he would like Verstappen as a team-mate at Aston Martin, Fernando Alonso said: \"Yes, but that's unlikely to happen, very unlikely.\" \nAlonso's current team-mate is Lance Stroll, the son of Aston Martin team owner Lawrence Stroll.\nNorris being forced to drive in 'uncomfortable ways'\nHow to follow Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on the BBC\nVerstappen moved to within one point of Norris in the standings with a brilliant win at the Japanese Grand Prix from pole position two weeks ago. \nHis weekend in Sakhir was a stark contrast to the highs of Suzuka as he qualified in seventh and finished the race three places lower than Briton Norris, who ended his day on the podium in third. \nVerstappen continued: \"I just go race by race. I think [Saudi Arabia] will be better than Bahrain. The rest is out of my hands. \n\"At the moment, we are not the quickest so it is tough to fight for a championship, but it is a long road. Last year here it all looked great and we know how the season ended up.\" \nRed Bull were untouchable in Jeddah last year with Verstappen first and then team-mate Sergio Perez second. But while the Dutchman went on to seal his fourth title in a row, Red Bull lost out to McLaren in the constructors' championship, eventually dropping behind Ferrari and finishing third. \n\"I enjoyed last year and the year before when we were dominant,\" said Verstappen. \n\"Now it is enjoyable in a way of the challenges that are out there and trying to improve the situation I would say.\n\"I am happy, I am not very happy with my car. But we all want to be better, there is no secret in that. We all want to improve.\" \nThis video can not be played\nFive things to know before the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix",

        "article_text": "Rice is a staple food for billions of people around the planet, but a new study suggests climate change may increase arsenic levels contained within the grain.\nRice is a staple food for more than half of the global population. It is consumed on a daily basis by more people than either wheat or maize, also known as corn.\nSo it is with some concern that scientists have unveiled a recent finding: that as carbon emissions rise and the Earth continues to warm, so too will arsenic levels in rice.\nThe presence of arsenic in rice has long been known as a problem. Almost all rice contains arsenic. The harmful, naturally occurring chemical can accumulate in the soil of paddy fields, leaching into the grains of rice grown there. But the amounts found in rice grains can vary considerably from well below the recommended limits set by regulatory bodies to several times higher.\nYet, consuming even low amounts of inorganic arsenic through food or drinking water can lead to cancers and a range of other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nResearchers around the world have been working on ways to reduce the levels of arsenic in rice \u2013 and in the meantime, there are ways of cooking it that can extract some of this harmful element from grains (see the box further down the story for more).\nBut a new study of inorganic arsenic accumulation has found it may become a greater problem due to climate change. The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.\nThey found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.\n\"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health \u2013 it's a long laundry list,\" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. \"And two metrics of climate change \u2013 the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures \u2013 are resulting in greater amounts.\"\nIt's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions \"business as usual\" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.\nWhile the researchers focused on locations in China for their experiments, they say such impacts are likely to be seen in rice grown in regions including Europe and the US too, as inorganic arsenic is common in rice grown around the world.\n\"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature \u2013 but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us,\" says Ziska.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The foods that eat up carbon\n\u2022 Saving Italy's polluted sea\n\u2022 Why we may soon need to eat 'resurrection' plants\nOf course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice \u2013 so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.\nStill, this is \"one of the most comprehensive studies\" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study. \"This is as robust as you\u2019re ever likely to get.\"\nHumans have known for hundreds of years that arsenic is toxic. Its tasteless, colourless, odourless nature even made it a preferred method for dispatching enemies in the courts of ancient Rome and medieval Europe. But in single doses at trace amounts, it does not cause poisoning.\nOver the last few decades scientists have discovered that even lower amounts of arsenic can cause health impacts when exposure happens chronically over a lifetime.\nThis is particularly true of inorganic arsenic, which is more readily able to attach to biomolecules in the human body where it can cause harm. While naturally occurring in rocks and soils, inorganic arsenic can be a byproduct of activities like mining, coal burning and other industrial processes. (Read more about why \"natural\" doesn\u2019t always mean better).\nThis means inorganic arsenic is particularly prevalent in the groundwater in a number of regions, including South America and parts of southern and central Asia. But people elsewhere are vulnerable too: in the US, for example, more than 7% of private well owners, or 2.1 million people, are drinking dangerous levels of inorganic arsenic. Worldwide, some 140 million people drink water with arsenic levels above the WHO-recommended guidelines.\u00a0\nAnd, outside of drinking water, the main source of dietary exposure to arsenic worldwide is rice. In regions that tend to have little arsenic in their groundwater, like Europe, rice is the single biggest source of dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.\nLowering the arsenic in your rice\nIf you want to lower your arsenic exposure from rice, there are a few things you can do.\nFirst, some types of rice have more inorganic arsenic than others. White rice has a lower inorganic arsenic content than brown rice but has less nutritional value. Basmati rice has less inorganic arsenic than other varieties. And rice from certain areas, including east Africa, has less arsenic than rice from other areas, including parts of the US, Europe, and south-east Asia.\nResearchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK also recently discovered a way of cooking rice that can remove 50% of the arsenic in brown rice and 74% from white rice. They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.\nThe UK's Food Standard's Agency recommends rinsing your rice before cooking and then boiling it in six parts water to one part rice before draining and rinsing again.\nThe problem comes down to how around 75% of the world's supply of rice is grown, says Ziska \u2013 in irrigated paddy fields.\nRice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. \"That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe,\" Ziska says. \"But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil.\" In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate reactions with other minerals in the soil that make the arsenic more bioavailable and easier for the rice plants to absorb through their root systems.\n\"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own,\" Ziska says. It changes the microbiome of the soil in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.\nAnd this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. \"This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active,\" Ziska says. \"It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy.\"\nZiska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.\nWhat worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment of inorganic arsenic's \"cancer potency factor\", taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that \"arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed\", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the risk of skin cancer, but lung and bladder cancers.\nAside from cancer, inorganic arsenic raises the risk of heart disease and diabetes. When consumed by pregnant women, it also makes foetal or infant mortality more likely, as well as raises the risk that the infant will be born low birth weight \u2013 which can have lifelong health impacts such as cardiovascular disease \u2013 or have developmental neurocognitive effects.\nFor individuals, the risks are slight. For example, the latest EPA review found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day \u2013 or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person \u2013 would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.\nBut across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.\nInorganic arsenic\nIf everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, the EPA calculates that \u2013 compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic \u2013 an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.\nThe amount of inorganic arsenic in rice varies enormously. But one study found that the global median amount is 66 micrograms per kg of rice. The EU set a limit in 2023 on inorganic arsenic in rice at 200 micrograms per kg of rice.\nSo, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?\n\"We can't pretend that we're going to take rice off the table. That's not feasible,\" says Nachman. As well as an important food tradition, rice is important to people living in poverty, some of whom get up to half of their daily calories from rice alone. \"But we need to do something differently.\"\nResearchers have also been experimenting with whether different types of water management could reduce arsenic levels. One process \u2013 where, instead of flooding a field continuously, the field is partly flooded, drained and then flooded again \u2013 does seem to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic. \"But that just increases cadmium,\" Marham says. \"And cadmium is perceived as an even bigger threat.\" Cadmium can cause breast, lung, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancers, as well as liver and kidney disease.\nThere is also interest in trying to breed varieties of rice that take up less inorganic arsenic, but this hasn't yet panned out, researchers say.\nBecause some types of rice accumulate less inorganic arsenic, there is interest in exploring their cultivation. Another solution might be adding sulphur to water, which can absorb electrons, like arsenic. Another way to shift the microbiome of fields could be adding certain types of fertiliser \u2013 one combination found to decrease arsenic content has been a mix of mountain thyme and bird manure. But more research on any of these approaches is needed.\nAnother approach may be to grow rice under rainwater-fed conditions, or where both the soil and irrigation water are lower in arsenic. Rice from East Africa, which tends to be rainwater- rather than irrigation-fed, has been found to be particularly low in inorganic arsenic, as has rice in Indonesia. Rice grown in the US, Central and South America, south-east Asia, Europe and Australia all have been found to have higher amounts of arsenic.\nThere also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say. \"Policymakers have been dragging their feet for decades on this,\" says Marham.\u00a0\nCurrently, the US Food and Drug Administration does not regulate arsenic levels in rice but has set a limit of 0.1mg/kg of rice intended for consumption by children. In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.\n\"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown,\" Ziska says. \"It really needs attention, because it affects so many individuals globally.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Humans are tired... you kind of know that your personal bias is entering in to your marking,\" he added.\nDave Costen, digital lead for Elizabeth College, said AI was not yet able to substitute for teaching.\nMr Costen said one difference was AI gave \"too much [information] to students straight away\" whereas teachers \"develop the learning [of students] gradually\".\nStudents generally have a poor understanding of AI, he said.\nDespite this, some Elizabeth College students had experimented with the technology, he said. \nOne student explained to the BBC that AI was not good at adjusting the difficulty of example questions. \nAnother student said some of their peers over-relied on AI, and used it to complete work for them, which was not helping them learn.\nAI was also better at some subjects than others, a third explained. It was very strong at coding, but in subjects that required reasoning it \"really struggled\".\nParent Gazz Barbe said he uses parental controls to restrict his daughter's phone use, and added that he did not allow the use of AI technology. \n\"I worry that if I give my daughter unrestricted access to this technology, she will use it to complete homework assignments. \n\"And if she does this in a subject that she really struggles with, she could easily become over-reliant on the technology,\" he said.\n\"The positive potential is absolutely massive... so long as it's used as a tool to assist teachers instead of doing the teaching,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

        "article_text": "When US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in his first term, Vietnamese entrepreneur Hao Le saw an opportunity.\nHis company is one of hundreds of businesses that have emerged to compete with Chinese exports that have increasingly been facing restrictions from the West.\nLe's SHDC Electronics, which sits in the budding industrial hub of Hai Duong, sells $2m (\u00a31.5m) worth of phone and computer accessories every month to the US. \nBut that revenue could dry up if Trump imposes 46% tariffs on Vietnamese goods, a plan that is currently on hold until early July.  That would be \"catastrophic for our business,\" Le says. \nAnd selling to Vietnamese consumers is not an option, he adds: \"We cannot compete with Chinese products. This is not just our challenge. Many Vietnamese companies are struggling in their own home market.\"\nTrump tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers. But they also opened new doors for other businesses, often into global supply chains that wanted to cut their dependence on China.   \nBut Trump 2.0 threatens to shut those doors. And that's a blow for fast-growing economies like Vietnam and Indonesia that are gunning to be key players in industries from chips to electric vehicles.\nThey also find themselves stuck between the world's two biggest economies - China, a powerful neighbour and their biggest trading partner, and the US, a key export market, which could be looking to strike a deal at Beijing's expense.\nChinese President Xi Jinping has been visiting Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week, urging unity against Trump's tariffs. The trip was long planned but has fresh urgency given how significant South East Asia is to the Chinese economy. \nChina earned a record $3.5tn from exports in 2024 - 16% of its exports go to South East Asia, making it the biggest market. \n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC on Tuesday, ahead of Xi's visit.\n\"If the issue is about something that we feel is against our interest, then we will protect [ourselves].\"\nIn the days after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariffs, South East Asian governments scrambled into deal-making mode.\nIn what Trump described as a \"very productive call\" with Vietnamese leader To Lam, the latter offered to completely scrap tariffs on US goods. \nThe US market is crucial to Vietnam, an emerging electronics powerhouse where manufacturing giants like Samsung, Intel and Foxconn, the Taiwanese firm contracted to make iPhones, have set up shop.\nMeanwhile, Thai officials are headed to Washington with a plan that includes higher US imports and investments. The US is their largest export market, so they are hoping to avoid the 36% levy on Thailand that Trump may reinstate.\n\"We will tell the US government that Thailand is not only an exporter but also an ally and economic partner that the US can rely on in the long term,\" Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said.\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has ruled out retaliation against Trump's tariffs, instead choosing to emphasise their economic and political importance to the US.\n\"We understand the concerns of the US,\" Mr Zafrul told the BBC. \"That's why we need to show that actually we, Asean, especially Malaysia, can be that bridge.\"\nIt's a role that South East Asia's export-driven economies have played well - they have benefitted from both Chinese and US trade and investment. But Trump's paused levies could derail that. \nIndonesia, which could face 32% tariffs, is home to vast nickel reserves and has its sights set on the global electric vehicle supply chain. Malaysia, which is gearing up to be a semiconductor hub, could be hit with 24% tariffs.\nCambodia, a Chinese ally, faces the steepest levies: 49%.  One of the poorest countries in the region, it has thrived as a trans-shipment hub for Chinese businesses seeking to skirt US tariffs. Chinese businesses currently own or operate 90% of the clothes factories, which mainly export to the US.\nTrump may have hit pause on these tariffs but \"the damage is done,\" says Doris Liew, an economist at Malaysia's Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs.\n\"This serves as a wake-up call for the region, not only to reduce reliance on the US, but also to re-balance overdependence on any single trade and export partner.\"\nIn these uncertain times , Xi Jinping is tyring to send a steadfast message: Let's join hands and resist \"bullying\" from the US.\nThat is no easy task because South East Asia also has trade tensions with Beijing. \nIn Indonesia, business owner Isma Savitri is worried that Trump's 145% tariffs on China means more competition from Chinese rivals who can no longer export to the US. \n\"Small businesses like us feel squeezed,\" says the owner of sleepwear brand Helopopy. \"We are struggling to survive against an onslaught of ultra-cheap Chinese products.\"\nOne of Helopopy's popular pyjamas sells for $7.10 (119,000 Indonesian rupiah). Isma says she has seen similar designs from China going for around half that price.\n\"South East Asia, being close by, with open trade regimes and fast-growing markets, naturally became the dumping ground,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"Politically, many countries are reluctant to confront Beijing, which adds another layer of vulnerability.\"\nWhile consumers have welcomed competitively-priced Chinese products - from clothes to shoes to phones - thousands of local businesses have not been able to match such low prices.\nMore than 100 factories in Thailand have closed every month for the last two years, according to an estimate from a Thai think tank. During the same period in Indonesia, around 250,000 textile workers were laid off after some 60 garment manufacturers shut, local trade associations say  - including Sritex, once the region's largest textile maker.\n\"When we see the news, there are lots of imported products flooding the domestic market, which messes up our own market,\" Mujiati, a worker who was laid off from Sritex in February after 30 years, tells the BBC.\n\"Maybe it just wasn't our luck,\" says the 50-year-old, who is still hunting for work. \"Who can we complain to? There's no-one.\"\nSouth East Asian governments responded with a wave of protectionism, as local businesses demanded to be shielded from the impact of Chinese imports.\nLast year Indonesia considered 200% tariffs on a range of Chinese goods and blocked e-commerce site Temu, popular among Chinese merchants. Thailand tightened inspections of imports and imposed additional tax on goods worth less than 1,500 Thai baht ($45; \u00a334).\nThis year Vietnam has twice imposed temporary anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel products. And after Trump's latest tariffs announcement, Vietnam is reportedly set to crack down on Chinese goods being trans-shipped via its territory to the US.\nAllaying these fears would have been on Xi's agenda this week. \nChina is concerned that channelling its US-bound exports to the rest of the world would \"end up really alienating and aggravating\" its trading partners, David Rennie, the former Beijing bureau chief for the Economist newspaper, told BBC's Newshour.\n\"If a tidal wave of Chinese exports ends up swamping those markets and damaging employment and jobs \u2026 that's a massive diplomatic and geopolitical headache for the Chinese leadership.\"\nChina has not always had an easy relationship with this region. Barring Laos, Cambodia and a war-torn Myanmar, the others are wary of Beijing's ambitions. Terrirorial disputes in the South China have soured ties with the Philippines. This is also an issue with others such as Vietnam and Malaysia, but trade has been a balancing factor. \nBut that might change now, experts say. \n\"South East Asia had to think about whether they really wanted to offend China. Now this complicates things,\" says Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore. \nChina's loss could be South East Asia's gain. \nHao Le, in Vietnam, says he has seen a surge in enquiries from American customers scouting for new electronics suppliers, outside of China: \"In the past, US buyers would take months to switch suppliers. Today, such decisions are made within days.\"\nMalaysia, with sprawling rubber plantations and the world's largest medical rubber glove maker, has nearly half the world's market for rubber gloves. But it is poised to grab a bigger share from its main competitor, China.   \nThe region still faces a 10% baseline tariff, like most of the world. And that is bad news, says Oon Kim Hung, president of the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association. \nBut even if the paused tariffs kick in, he says, customers will find paying an additional 24% on Malaysian gloves vastly preferable to the 145% levy they will jave to cough up for Chinese-made gloves.\n\"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit our manufacturers, as well as those in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.\"\nAdditional reporting by Bui Thu and Tessa Wong",

This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.\nThe region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered.

It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.\nPeople largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm \u2013 think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.\nThe prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the \"cradle of American golf\", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is the horse riding hub Southern Pines and its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.\nHunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and \u2013 the star attraction \u2013 imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nBut travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.\n\"It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,\" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.\nBurns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled) kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.\nDon Dees, who owns and operates Dees Bees Apiary in nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check his Facebook page for updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (\u00a313) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about \u00a358) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.\nPlan your trip\n- If you\u2019re looking to purchase your own jar of amethyst treasure, keep an eye out online for availability toward late July. Dees Bees Apiary tends to sell in smaller increments so more people have the chance to try it.\n- At other times of year, drop into local shops and farmers' markets to taste the distinct honey varieties grown here, from sourwood to apple blossom to tupelo, and if you\u2019re lucky, some of the purple stuff, too.\n- Visitors can also take a honey tour with Honeybee Bliss, where suited-up guests play honey sommelier and take a turn at pulling bee-laden frames oozing with golden goo.\nDees' take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.\nHowever, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, \"to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way\".\nBurns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. \"One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it.\" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. \"Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\n\u2022 The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.\nThere's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers \u2013 who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff \u2013 can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets \u2013 and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated. And the final part of the script was written when Alexander-Arnold returned as a substitute with 19 minutes left, having been out since early March with an ankle injury.\nPremier League: Leicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold scores Liverpool winner - report & reaction\n'I know why Real appeal to Alexander-Arnold - I was tempted too'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\nSuperstar Trent Alexander Arnold's 'unbelievable' left foot half-volley\nIt took him five minutes to release the pressure valve, of sorts, that had been building as the doomed Foxes frustrated Liverpool.\nThe scenes that followed will be tantalising ones for any Liverpool fan who clings to the hope Alexander-Arnold will reject the advances of Real Madrid.\nCould there still be a late twist in Alexander-Arnold's long-running contract situation?\nCould the wild celebrations, and the communion between Alexander-Arnold and those fans in one red-drenched corner of King Power Stadium, make him rethink his next move?\nThere is confidence in Spain that Alexander-Arnold will be at Real Madrid next season - but the leaving of Liverpool will still be tough for a player who grew up in the city's West Derby district.\nHe has faced some criticism for not committing to Liverpool, especially since Salah and Van Dijk signed new contracts, but there was none here. This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "\"Please be upstanding for the world's most confusing House of Games contestant and Bake Off failure, Self Esteem!\"\nThis is how Rebecca Lucy Taylor \u2013 aka celebrated pop singer Self Esteem \u2013 is introduced to the stage at London's Duke of York's Theatre.\nIt's a typically irreverent comment, an example of the dry wit she uses to sweeten the sincerity and anger of her music.\n\"You can take piccies and videos,\" the off-stage voice continues, \"because she needs all the help she can get.\"\nThat, too, is strictly tongue-in-cheek.\nThree years ago, Taylor released her second album, Prioritise Pleasure, a body-shaking manifesto for female self-worth that bristled at society's expectations while acknowledging her own shortcomings (\"Sexting you at the mental health talk seems counterproductive,\" she observed on Moody).\nAfter 10 years in mid-ranking indie band Slow Club, the album propelled her into uncharted realms.\nThere were magazine covers, nominations for the Mercury Prize and Brit Awards, a starring role on stage in Cabaret, a support slot with Adele and, yes, an appearance on Celebrity Bake Off \u2013 where, unfortunately, she burned her crumpets.\n\"The week that Prioritise Pleasure came out, my whole life changed,\" she reflects.\n\"Not financially or in terms of fame, but it's like there was a knot in my stomach that untied.\n\"Then everyone was like, 'Right, can you do that again, please?'\"\nTaylor tore herself in two to make the follow-up, A Complicated Woman, which comes out on Friday.\nAfter playing it live for the first time in the West End on Wednesday, she describes the album's gestation process as \"horrible\", \"lonely\", and \"painful\".\n\"It just felt really stressful to execute what was in my head,\" she explains in a phone interview the next morning.\n\"I was thinking so big, but I still don't have access to the resources I need to make it as big as I wanted.\"\nPart of the problem was a punishing, but self-imposed, time limit.\n\"The music industry is like, 'You've got 10 minutes, then you're over and someone else is going to take your place',\" she explains.\n\"So I felt like I had no choice [but to commit to another record] if I wanted to build on what I'd done.\n\"But as painful as it was and as dark as it got, the second I'm back on stage performing it, I'm like, 'Oh, this is why I love it'.\"\nShe hasn't just made a new album - she has also created a daring, jaw-dropping theatrical experience to go with it.\nIt's set in a sparse recreation of the community centre where eight-year-old Becky from Rotherham learned to tap dance.\n\"You just wanted to sing / You didn't know what that would bring,\" recalls an older, more cynical version of that child \u2013 as she assesses her life at the age of 38.\n\"This really is all there is, and that's what you've got to get comfortable with.\" \nAs the show opens, 10 dancers line up on either side of her, dressed in austere outfits that recall The Handmaid's Tale.\nInitially, their movements are stiff and restricted but, as Taylor describes suffocating relationships with emotionally-stunted men, they start to thrash and jerk their bodies.\n\"We start in that world where we're shackled, and then we exorcise it,\" Taylor explains.\n\"Over the course of the show, it all unravels and everyone ends up being themselves instead of conforming to these societal norms.\"\nA four-night theatre residency is an unusual way to launch an album. The audience is unfamiliar with most of the songs, and no-one's sure whether to absorb the performance attentively, or sing along and dance.\nSeveral times, laughter ripples through the theatre as the singer's more acerbic observations hit home. The following morning, she's not quite sure what to make of the reaction.\n\"Every time people laugh, my heart sinks,\" she says. \"But then I'm like, the lyrics are funny, aren't they?\n\"And I love changing the laughter into emotion. It feels like people are laughing because it's uncomfortable.\"\nIn the end, the audience members mirror the on-stage narrative. Shaking off their discomfort, they rise out of their seats and start making an almighty racket.\nThe music becomes a soundtrack to solidarity - which, it transpires, was Taylor's intention. \nA Complicated Woman might be as cutting and powerful as its predecessor, but the melodies were designed for stadiums.\n\"Do you remember the Elbow song One Day Like This?\" she asks. \"The one that goes, 'Throw those curtains wii-iide'?\n\"I went mad for that song when it came out and, honestly, I played it over and over in the studio and said, 'I want to do this'.\"\n\"I was very inspired by trying to make it onto World Cup montages. That's a genre of music that I really, really enjoy.\"\nThat's only half the story, though. The album is all about capturing the complex and contradictory impulses of a woman in her mid-30s.\nRecent single 69, for example, is a thumping house track on which Taylor talks with withering candour about her sex life. Imagine Madonna's Justify My Love, if she was really being honest.\n\"It's an idea I had for ages, of listing sex positions and scoring them so that there's no grey area [for prospective partners],\" the singer laughs. \n\"But there's a more political element, which is that women still aren't saying what they want in the bedroom. And I'm like, I can't bear this any more. Please let us just enjoy having sex.\n\"It's not exactly going to win an Ivor Novello Award for lyrics, but I think it stands on the album with moments that are more emotional and deep.\"\nThose moments include The Curse, a rousing ballad about using alcohol to dull her anxiety, which is possibly the best song Self Esteem's ever written.\nHer personal favourite, however, is called In Plain Sight. A collaboration with South African musician Moonchild Sanelly, it's a response to the criticism they've both received for speaking their minds.\n\"The world is saying who I am, but I thought I knew myself all these years,\" says Sanelly in a semi-improvised rap. \n\"I shrink to keep the peace, hoping I don't shake my purpose.\"\nIt's a feeling Taylor immediately recognised. \nAs excitement built around Prioritise Pleasure in 2021, she started getting \"nasty messages\" on social media, which shook her up.\n\"I was really shocked the first time I got grief, because no-one's ever been that bothered about what I'm doing,\" she says.\n\"People say you should ignore it, but if you went to a wedding and had a nice day and one person called you an [expletive], who would you go home thinking about? It's just human nature.\"\nEventually, the criticism took its toll.\n\"There were moments where I considered giving up, which shocked me because I've been this defiant, angry thing for so long,\" she says.\n\"But over the last few years, especially with the world being like it is, I've definitely had feelings of protecting myself and shutting up.\n\"That's the saddest part of the album, really. But I found a way through.\n\"And if I can, then I hope the rest of the world can too, you know?\"\nThat realisation is the connecting tissue of A Complicated Woman.\nLife is never easy, she says. No-one is ever truly satisfied. Relationships are hard work. You can't please everyone. But that's OK. You're OK. Trust your gut.\nShe sums it up on Focus Is Power, held aloft by the sound of a gospel choir: \"And now I see it clear with every passing of each year / I deserve to be here.\"\nOn stage in London, she sings those final lines a capella with her dancers and backing singers, arms wrapped around each other in a display of female solidarity.\nIt's a cathartic moment after the bruising process of putting the album together.\n\"There's so much joy in being a woman and just being yourself can be beautiful,\" she says. \"You've just got to find a way to do it.\"\nWith that, she's off to make tweaks for the show's second night. After that, she has to find a way to scale down the West End production for a UK tour.\n\"I'll do what I can to make it continue, but it's a huge risk because there's so little revenue from anything else,\" she says. \nUltimately, though, her ambition is undimmed.\n\"I want to make 20 albums, I want to do bigger theatre shows,\" she says.\n\"Of course it'd be useful if I could 'cross over' because everything gets easier when you've got more resources.\n\"But last night I was like, 'Bloody hell, you did what you set out to do'. So I'm good.\"",
