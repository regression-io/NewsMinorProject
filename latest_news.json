        "article_text": "Southern California is frequently shaken by earthquakes. How they feel to people living in Los Angeles has a lot to do with the sediment-filled basin the city sits upon.\nHollywood stars were just starting to arrive at their afterparties following the Oscars when the ground suddenly jolted. There were a few screams and high-rise buildings reportedly wobbled.\u00a0\nThe magnitude 3.9 earthquake that hit North Hollywood on 2 March 2025 was the latest in a number of jolts to have hit the area. The earthquake was measured to have occurred at a depth of around 9 miles (15km), but was felt in parts of the city several miles away. Another much smaller\u00a0magnitude 1.3 earthquake was detected almost in the same location a few hours later. No damage to buildings was reported.\nIt wasn't a terribly unusual event, by California's standards. The state is the\u00a0second-most seismically active\u00a0in\u00a0the United States behind Alaska, with Southern California experiencing an\u00a0earthquake on average every three minutes. In the week leading up to the post-Oscars quake, 36 earthquakes occured in the LA area, with most being under magnitude 2.0.\u00a0While most are too small to be felt, around\u00a015-20 events exceed magnitude 4.0 each year.\nThe most recent occured a little over an hour after sunset on 6 August 2024, when a sparsely populated belt of farmland near Bakersfield, Southern California, was shaken from a restful evening. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake, followed by hundreds of smaller aftershocks, shuddered through the area as a fault near the southern end of the Central Valley ruptured \u2013 the largest earthquake to hit Southern California in three years. The epicenter was about 17 miles (27km) south of Bakersfield and people reported shaking nearly 90 miles (145km) away in portions of Los Angeles and as far away as San Diego. Then, a few days later, another jolt rattled the Los Angeles area due to a rupture on a small section of the dangerous Puente Hills fault system. The resulting magnitude 4.4 earthquake had its epicentre just four miles northeast of the city's downtown area.\nAlthough there was minimal damage caused by both quakes in August 2024 and the less severe shake in Hollywood in March 2025, they highlighted just how the geology under California's largest city can alter the effects of fault movements in the area. The relatively shallow depth of the 6 August earthquake appeared to create more intense or prolonged shaking in some parts of the city, while others felt almost nothing at all.\nThere are various reasons for why this might be \u2013 including what people were doing at the time of the earthquake \u2013 but the enormous five-mile-deep (8km), sediment-filled basin that LA is built upon plays a surprising role in the effects felt above ground.\nWhile the ground feels steadfast at the surface, deeply buried bedrock can resemble a shattered window pane. These cracks, or faults, are where earthquakes occur. Faults are put under tremendous stress by the slow and steady movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.\nIn California, the North American plate and the Pacific Plate are grinding past each other along the infamous San Andreas fault, averaging about 30-50 millimeters (1-2 inches) every year. The movement is anything but fluid. Cracked rocks are rough and wedge against each other, sometimes staying stuck for thousands of years. Over time, stress created by the slow marching tectonic plates builds up and when the fault reaches its stress limit, it \"slips\" and ruptures, causing an earthquake. \u00a0\nA rupture begins at one location and travels in one direction along the fault, stretching up to hundreds of kilometers. The longest rupture ever recorded was a 994 mile (1,600km) portion of a fault that caused the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and resulting tsunami on Boxing Day 2004. \"The farther it goes, the longer [the earthquake] lasts, and the more energy that's released. So the longer the fault, the bigger the earthquake,\" explains seismologist Lucy Jones, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology and former seismologist with the US Geological Survey.\nDuring an earthquake, the stored energy saved within the sticky fault is released suddenly. Seismic waves radiate out from the rupture like the ripples created by throwing a rock into a pond, spreading in all directions through the surrounding rock and earth.\u00a0\nThe magnitude of an earthquake tells scientists about the length of the ruptured fault as well as the duration of shaking, says Jones. But the intensity of an earthquake \u2013 the ground motions we feel at a location \u2013 is shaped by how close we are to the epicenter, which direction the fault ruptured, and the geological layers under our feet.\nLos Angeles is located south of a giant a bend in the San Andreas fault where the plate boundary clearly changes direction. \"If you see it from the air, it's amazing,\" says Jones. \"It's so bizarre \u2013 you can look down and see the fault valley and then it just turns.\"\nAround the turn, the region is chock full of faults. Over millions of years, the faults churned and pushed slabs of bedrock into multiple mountain ranges and deep basins. Gravity, water and wind act like sandpaper, wearing down the mountains, and carrying debris into the basins. Over time, the basins have been filled with sediment.\nThe bowl-shaped basin of rock under Los Angeles is up to five miles (8km) deep, filled with a mixture of gravel, sand and clay. The contrast between the hard rock and softer sediment are big factors that cause some seismic weirdness for cities like Los Angeles.\nDuring an earthquake, seismic waves are modulated by geology, says John Vidale, professor of seismology at University of Southern California. \"The primary factor is just how hard is the ground and how deep is the structure that has soft [material] near the surface,\" he says. Seismic waves will move faster in denser material like rock, versus softer and less dense sediment.\nAs seismic waves travel through the basin, their behaviour changes when they encounter the loose sediment. \"[The wave] is now having to travel at a much slower speed, but it still has to carry the same amount of energy per unit time,\" said Jones. As the wave slogs through the sediment, the amplitude, or wave height, gets bigger.\nPut another way, imagine the Los Angeles basin as a giant bowl of jelly \u2013 the dense rocky mountains and underlying rock make up the bowl, while the sediment fill is represented by the gelatinous mixture. \"If you shake the bottom [of the bowl] a little bit, the top flops back and forth quite a bit,\" says Vidale. And atop this quivering mass of jelly is the megacity of Los Angeles.\nThis means the amplitude of the waves within a basin can be significantly bigger than those moving through rock. In one study, researchers using earthquake measurements in the Los Angeles region from the 1992 Landers earthquake found that seismic waves inside the Los Angeles basin were three to four times larger than sites outside the basin.\nIn addition to amplification, seismic waves can also reverberate within a sediment-filled basin. Think back to that shaking bowl of jelly and how the flopping top bounces off the sides of the bowl. Scientists from the Statewide California Earthquake Center simulated earthquakes in the Los Angeles region and found that the basin can trap seismic wave energy in a similar way. This reverberation can mean shaking can often go on for longer than the duration of the fault rupture itself, increasing the hazard for the city built on top.\nAs if that wasn't enough for Los Angeles, the close proximity of the San Bernadino and San Gabriel Basins to the Los Angeles Basins can create a funneling effect, directing seismic waves towards Los Angeles.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Will we ever be able to predict earthquakes?\n\u2022\u00a0The animals that can predict disasters\n\u2022\u00a0How your mobile phone can detect earthquakes\nEven within a basin, there can be differences in how the sediment interacts with seismic waves. \"There's variability in the shaking\u2026 there's variations in the geology,\" says Vidale. Sediment in the upper 330ft (100m) of the basin tends to be looser and less dense than the deeper, compacted sediment below. Sediment changes can also happen quickly at the surface. \"Old stream channels, for example, can be filled with a kind of wet, soft material,\" Vidale says. \"So, if you happen to be in an old stream channel, you'll get hit a lot harder than somebody even a quarter mile away that's on firmer ground.\"\nEven those in the same house can have different experiences, especially if the earthquake is on the smaller side. \"I'm in Pasadena, on the sediment in the San Gabriel Valley,\" say Jones. Despite both being in the house, she and her husband had different experiences of the earthquake on 6 August 2024. \"I felt it, my husband didn't,\" she says.\nWhile the city of Los Angeles ticks a lot of seismic hazard boxes, it is not the only urban center that needs to worry. Throughout human history, people have tended to build cities on flat ground near water bodies.\nIt just so happens that these sites tend to form above geologic basins and sometimes near faults.\u00a0\nWhile the US has a few famous cities built on basins \u2013 Seattle, Portland, and Salt Lake City \u2013 there are many others around the world that experience amplified seismic waves due to where they are situated. After the European settlers drained Lake Texcoco in the 1500s, Mexico City was built on the flat, old lake bottom. In 1985 and 2017, the city experienced significant damage from earthquakes that shook the basin sediments.\nThe desert megacity of Tehran in Iran also sits atop a geologic basin filled with river sediments, and there is growing concern about the risk of a major earthquake in the area.\nUnderstanding the earthquake risk is the first step in bolstering protection for a city against significant shaking. Enacting robust building codes can be another way to protect people and infrastructure, but it often takes a major event for stricter regulations to be implemented. After the devastating earthquake in 1985, for example, Mexico City enacted stringent building codes, and retrofitted older buildings.\u00a0\n\"The very first earthquake codes [in California] went in after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake,\" adds Jones. At that time, schools were built out of firesafe, unreinforced brick. \"Seventy schools were completely destroyed \u2013 luckily, it was at six o'clock at night,\" says Jones. The horror of collapsing schools spurred regulation, but initial codes were meagre. \"They basically just said, 'don't build unreinforced masonry in California'. \u00a0That was sort of the first basic code.\"\nToday, assessing earthquake risks is a lot more nuanced.\nIn the US, a team of seismologists, geoscientists and geophysicists have created a seismic hazard map, showing the chances of a damaging earthquake shaking in the next 100 years. In their latest version of the report, the team found that that nearly 75% of the US could experience damaging shaking. To help policymakers and engineers, the team included information on the implications for building and structural designs.\nWhile building codes can protect lives, scientists like Jones want building codes to go further. Designing buildings so they can be more easily repaired rather than needing to be demolished would cost an extra 1% in the construction phase, Jones estimates. \"We're calling it 'functional recovery',\" she says.\n\"We are trying to say that 'just not killing you' is an insufficient standard. The reality is, if your building's badly damaged and now has to be torn down after the earthquake, you've hurt your tenants, you've hurt your neighbors, you've hurt the local economy.\"\nFortunately, the buildings of Los Angeles rode out the latest quakes to rattle Southern California pretty well.

        "article_text": "Meghan's new Netflix series in which she offers cooking and home tips arrives next week. She's just the latest high-profile woman to present herself as a lifestyle guru \u2013 and divide opinion in doing so.\nThe Duchess of Sussex's lifestyle show is finally arriving on Netflix on Tuesday, after being pushed back because of the Los Angeles fires. With Love, Meghan sees her picking flowers, cooking with friends, and looking radiant in a huge, glossy Californian home.\nThe move into such well-worn domestic-goddess territory saw Meghan instantly dubbed \"the millennial Martha Stewart of Montecito\" in The New York Times. But of course, this being Meghan \u2013 the subject of a vast amount of criticism in the British media specifically and on social media generally \u2013 backlash flared the minute the trailer was released. She's flaunting her wealth, said her critics: tone-deaf. She's becoming a trad wife: bad feminist. She's fake, she just wants to sell products, she's unbearably earnest\u2026\u00a0\nAnd yet, Meghan has her fans as much as her detractors, and it's likely that With Love, Meghan will be a ratings hit for the streamer, bringing people together: not always in the way the show intends perhaps, but by persuading both those who buy into the pretty-princess fantasy \u2013 and those who may \"hate-watch\" it \u2013 to tune in, agog. \"Everyone's invited to create wonder in every moment\" \u2013 as Meghan puts it.\nThe public's feelings towards domestic goddesses \u2013 those women who sell a lifestyle, and a very particular idealised version of womanhood \u2013 have always been complex, but they may have never been more conflicted than in 2025. \"Of course, the image of the idealised woman has changed over time, and even more rapidly in recent years\" says Dr Edith Hill, an Australian academic whose research is in social media, influencers and women's bodies online. These days, Hill tells the BBC, \"there is no one ''ideal' image of a woman online, as each community and sub-community has their own version of the perfect creator.\" This means that the most famous end up both loved and loathed: figures like Meghan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nara Smith walk the line between having devoted fanbases, and being scorned, castigated and even blamed for a wealth of societal ills.\nNara Smith is probably the most famous iteration of the most vexed contemporary version of the domestic goddess: the trad wife. Smith has 11.5 million followers on TikTok \u2013 that's a lot of people who want to watch videos from her home in Texas, where she raises kids and bakes their food from scratch. While wearing ballgowns. In a gorgeous kitchen. You could say it's aggressively aspirational \u2013 but it's also patently unrealistic. I doubt many people watching genuinely wish they too could make their toddlers homemade bubblegum while wearing a lime-green conical-bust gown. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\n\u2022 Ten of the best TV shows to watch this March\n\u2022 Why influencers are facing a pushback\nOf course, many women do find joy and satisfaction in the kitchen \u2013 or in other traditional domestic activities, such as hosting, home-making, arranging flowers, dressing in a feminine way\u2026 there's nothing inherently \"unfeminist\" with any of that. But the broader interest in trad wives \u2013 women who espouse traditional 1950s-style family values, and dedicate themselves wholly to keeping house and raising kids \u2013 has been seen by many as a worryingly retrograde step. Less domestic goddess, more domestic servitude, is the gist of the criticism. \"There is a certain undertone from some of the more traditional creators that does lean toward very stereotypical gender roles and strong religious ideals, that can lead to the oppression of women,\" says Hill. \"It would be naive to ignore the very close line that can be drawn between that content and women's oppression.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe recent obsession with trad wives may reflect a broader disenchantment with modern lifestyles: the anxiety that what equality of the sexes actually brought us is merely drudgery for all. When two parents have to work constantly in order to have enough money to live, and women also end updoing a \"second shift\" of housework and childcare, the old model of dividing the labour might look more appealing.\nArguably, we could more accurately place the source of the problem with capitalism, rather than feminism \"gone too far\". And it is unfortunately inevitable that full-time tradwiffery requires a partner who earns a lot of money, inevitably also bringing that traditional dynamic into play: domestic bliss predicated on man-as-breadwinner, woman-as-helpmeet.\nBut as much as there is endless hand-wringing in the media over the meaning of the trad-wife phenomenon, in some ways, it's nothing new: domestic goddesses have always been a source of fascination \u2013 dismissed as retrograde by some, and yet a source of aspiration, inspiration, and even compulsion for others. Because they don't just present a certain lifestyle: they often promise that you, scruffy disorganised frazzled ordinary woman, could be a domestic goddess too, if you just do what they say. Witness: the OG DG, Martha Stewart, who made a multi-million-dollar empire out of housekeeping tips.\nStewart made her name as a hard-grafting lifestyle guru who would tell you exactly what to do, and how to do it properly, whether putting up a shelf or planning a wedding. And part of the appeal of domestic goddesses has always been this illusion of control, of solution: do this, and have a better life.\nStewart started out running a catering business in 1975, before publishing the legendary 1982 glossy how-to guide, Entertaining. It was just the starting gun of the unstoppable Martha Stewart brand, that's since flogged everything from tea towels to CBD gummies; she's published more than 100 books offering brisk guidance on gardening, hosting, cooking and homemaking. And the news that Entertaining is to be republished this year surely supports the theory that we're in a retro domestic goddess moment.\nFollowing in Martha's footsteps came another US DG who inspires a devoted following: Ina Garten aka The Barefoot Contessa. Garten just published a memoir, Be Ready When the Luck Happens, designed to persuade people that her seemingly charmed career \u2013 from running a Hamptons food store so casually chic that it featured in a Nancy Meyers movie, to fronting scores of cookery books and TV shows since the 90s \u2013 was the result of hard work and good timing, a blend of effort and effortlessness.\nGarten's recipes also straddle effort and effortlessness: she specialises in rich, indulgent, bistro-style deliciousness, and offers detailed instruction as to exactly how to achieve it. But she's won fans for her catchphrase \"store-bought is fine\": a pinch of realism amid the lifestyle gloss.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd of course, not all domestic goddesses have been about perfection or spending hours in the kitchen \u2013 in fact, many have made a career out of proffering tips and tricks to make hosting and homemaking easier. Shirley Conran, the British journalist and author \u2013 also sometimes called the \"original\" domestic goddess \u2013\u00a0 promoted the idea of women \"having it all\", and famously informed women in her 1975 pop-feminism housework manual Superwoman that \"life is too short to stuff a mushroom\". Nara Smith clearly didn't get the memo.\nThe idea of Superwoman was to liberate women from the tyranny of housework and perfection, not to be trapped by it: a domestic goddess in the 70s was the woman who had it all \u2013 job, home, marriage, kids, good sex, control of their finances, and a general air of fabulousness. The title was not actually meant to be taken seriously: \"A Superwoman isn\u2019t a woman who can do anything, but a woman who avoids doing too much,\" Conran wrote.\nAnd missing the irony has often been an issue for DGs \u2013 not least for the deliciously tongue-in-cheek Nigella Lawson, who helped popularise the term. The curvaceous, flirtatious British chef also began her career with a book full of time-saving tips and anti-perfectionist reassurance: \"Never worry about what your guests will think of you,\" she wrote encouragingly in How to Eat. \"Just think of the food. What will taste good?\"\nBut her second book in 1998 was called How to Be a Domestic Goddess \u2013 a joke that was missed, she's long insisted, and a title that now makes her cringe. \"It was supposed to be ironic,\" she told the New York Times in 2019. Today, Lawson is a full-on national treasure in the UK, but at the start of her fame, and rather like today's trad wives, she was castigated by some critics who accused her of setting back feminism. She has since countered her critics by describing baking as feminist.\nA domestic goddess became a standard to live up to, and yet another reason for women to feel inadequate. And this is the contradiction at the heart of DGs, whether they\u2019re incredibly earnest (Meghan; Gwyneth) or winkingly ironic (Lawson): while many give off an air of effortlessness and espouse mantras of ease for most women most of the time, such domestic bliss is actually not easy. Or, indeed, affordable. \"We're not in the pursuit of perfection, we're in the pursuit of joy,\" declares Meghan in the trailer for her show.\u00a0 But it's hard not to feel like it would be a lot easier to pursue joy if you lived in a Californian mansion with help. To state the obvious, an enviable, idealised lifestyle is more readily available when you don't have to stress about the bills, and instead have the free time to, say, learn to fold a napkin like an Easter bunny.\nIt is also so obvious as to be almost banal to point out that DGs are mostly very wealthy. And fortune begets fortune: all this lifestyle content is, on some level, also an advert for the DGs' product lines, whether that's Meghan's company, As Ever, selling jams, Ina's cookware, or Gwyneth\u2019s Goop empire.\nFor some, the wholesome, homespun emphasis on making preserves or crafting your own table decorations is particularly grating precisely because these women are clearly monied and leisured enough to have time for all that. Yet for others, that's what's appealing, even soothing, about watching them: we may not have a spare four hours to bake, but we can watch a four-minute video of Nara Smith baking; we may not have the money to make like Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway at the opening of the eponymous novel, and buy the flowers ourselves, but we can watch Meghan pick out blooms in a fancy florist.\n\"The domesticity is presented to us as peaceful while also fulfilling,\" says Hill, on the appeal of this sort of content, which it is so easy to be cynical about. \"Many people can relate to wanting to nourish and nurture their families, but what this looks like in reality for everyone else is at complete odds to the image we're presented through these curated narratives.\"\nPerhaps this is the key: we mustn't mistake today's goddesses with mere mortals \u2013 consider them floating fictional constructs, higher(-earning) beings. And absolutely not a yardstick against which to measure ideal femininity. \"I think we can be inspired by these women and the lives they are presenting,\" say Hill, \"while also recognising it is wholly impossible to attain.\"\nWith Love, Meghan is on Netflix from 4 March\nHolly Williams's novel, The Start of Something, is out in paperback now\u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

She had experienced a painful spell apart from her partner, Megan, and three children - twins Teddy and Tilly and youngest child Willow - when she first moved to the US but they had eventually resolved their visa issues, enabling them to be reunited, and set up their family home in California.\n\"It took 22 months to get them out there, we were 22 months apart, we weren't even out there a year [together] and I lost my job,\" she says.\n\"If I'm honest, I didn't think I deserved to lose my job either, so that made it even tougher, with the successes that we had, we just had a little dip. It wasn't even anything major.\n\"So to be treated in that way, after everything that had been done and sacrificed and everything that had been achieved, it was really, really hard to swallow on a personal level, but it was more what happened to my family.\n\"I have three young children, they were nine and six at the time, they didn't have a home. So that, for me, is inexcusable to do to a family.\"\nThe day her children were supposed to be back at school in August in San Diego following their summer break came and went, so Stoney took on home-schooling herself.\nIt was a period she describes as \"one of the hardest times in my life\".\nShe says: \"It did make me question if I wanted to stay in the game because if the game chews you up and spits you out like that, after everything that we had sacrificed to be there, and after what I had achieved in a short space of time, and what we had achieved as a club, it did make me question the game.\n\"I got offers quite quickly after the announcement and I said no to all of them, whether they were right or wrong, because I wanted to take time. I needed to make sure I sorted our lives out.\n\"My priority was my family [and] how do we get back to San Diego.\"\nCasey Stoney, whose former clubs include Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea, walked out to a guard of honour with her three children before her final match as a player in February 2018\nIt took four months for the family to get new visas, based on Stoney's consultancy work, enabling them to return to the US and \"our lives\". They had relied on family in England to provide a roof over their heads in the interim.\n\"[The children] missed two and a half months of education. They missed a lot of their life during that time.\"\nShe also had a lot of time for self-reflection and took the opportunity to visit different clubs as she reassessed her priorities.\n\"It just helped me get to a point where I was ready to get back in [to football] and I was very keen to get back in. At first I couldn't have thought of anything less that I wanted to be involved in and it just took a bit of time to heal the wounds.\"\nThe ex-England defender was spotted at her former club Arsenal, who were looking for a replacement for Jonas Eidevall while she was out of work, while other Women's Super League clubs also had vacancies during that time.\nBut then along came the Canada job.\nAt first she was unsure whether she wanted to move into international football and leave behind what she \"loves\", which is working with players day to day.\nYet the initial conversations proved appealing and she found herself in a lengthy interview process lasting some three to four months.\n\"I really liked that it was extensive,\" she says. \"It meant that their hiring process was thorough. I got to interview them as much as they interviewed me.\"\nThat included speaking to the manager of the men's team, former Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who had already made the transition from club to the international game.\nAnd she was impressed \u2013 by the organisation's leadership led by chief executive Kevin Blue, the culture of the team, and the talent of the players, plus Canada were happy for her to continue living in California if she took the role.\n\"When I interviewed for this job, Kevin was very clear that I didn't have to move,\" she said.\n\"That's been really, really beneficial for us as a family. I don't think people understand when you take on a head coach role, and I understand people say you're in a privileged position, but it's the impact on your family it has.\n\"I had young children that just didn't understand what was going on [when she was sacked] - lots of tears, lots of heartache, that I felt like I'd contributed to that, which was difficult.\n\"There were jobs open in the UK at the time when I didn't have a job. There were some I would have been interested in, some I wouldn't have been interested in, but as soon as I got involved in this process it became clear I was really interested in this [and] I was only committed to one thing.\"\nCasey Stoney took charge of Canada for the first time in February, overseeing two wins and one draw in the Pinatar Cup in Spain\nShe is taking over a country who are ranked sixth in the world but have experienced their own turmoil.\nDuring last summer's Paris Olympics, in which Canada reached the quarter-finals, two members of the team's coaching staff were sent home for flying a drone over a training session held by New Zealand, their opponents in a group game.\nTheir head coach Bev Priestman, another Englishwoman, was given a year-long ban by world governing body Fifa and Canada - who had won Olympic gold at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games - were docked six points.\nPriestman \"did reach out and wish me luck\" says Stoney, but they have had no other communication and the new Canada coach is keen to focus on the future, with the 2027 World Cup on the horizon.\nShe met the majority of her players for the first time over the last two weeks as Canada competed in a four-team tournament, the Pinatar Cup, in Spain, which they won following a 7-0 thrashing of Chinese Taipei, a 2-0 win over Mexico and a 1-1 draw with China.\n\"This team excites me,\" she says. \"I do think they've got so much potential.\n\"What they were able to achieve last year in difficult circumstances shows what they're capable of, but there's so much more to come.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "Urine was used as fertiliser in ancient Rome and China. Now farmers in Vermont are bringing this practice back to boost harvests and grow crops in a more sustainable way.\nWhen Betsy Williams goes to the loo, she likes to know her pee won't go to waste. For the last 12 years, she and her neighbours in rural Vermont, US, have diligently collected their urine and donated it to farmers for use as fertiliser for their crops.\n\"We're consuming all of these things that have nutrients in them, and then a lot of the nutrients that are passing through us can then get recycled back into helping create food for us and for animals. So to me, it's logical,\" Williams says.\nWilliams takes part in the Urine Nutrient Reclamation Program (UNRP), a programme run by the Rich Earth Institute (REI), a non-profit based in Vermont. She and 250 of her neighbours in Windham County donate a total of 12,000 gallons (45,400 litres) of urine to the programme each year to be recycled \u2013 or \"peecycled\".\u00a0\nWindham County's pee-donations are collected by a lorry and driven to a large tank where the urine is pasteurised by heating it to 80C (176F) for 90 seconds. It is then stored in a pasteurised tank, ready to be sprayed on local farmland when the time is right to fertilise crops.\nRecords suggest that urine was used to help grow crops back in ancient China and\u00a0ancient Rome. Today, scientists are finding that it can\u00a0more than double the yield of crops like kale and spinach compared to no fertiliser, and improve yields even in low fertility soils.\nUrine's power as a fertiliser is due to the nitrogen and phosphorus that it contains \u2013 the same nutrients that are added to the synthetic fertilisers used on many conventional farms. But these synthetic fertilisers come at an environmental cost. Nitrogen is produced using the fossil fuel-intensive Haber-Bosch process, and the mining of phosphorus creates harmful amounts of toxic waste. Urine, meanwhile, is freely available \u2013\u00a0as Williams puts it, \"everybody pees. [It's an] untapped resource\".\nNancy Love, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan who has collaborated with the team at REI over the last decade, has found that using urine instead of standard synthetic fertiliser reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and requires around half the amount of water. Indeed, since 2012, UNRP estimates that it has conserved over 2.7 million gallons (10.2 million litres) of water through preventing toilet flushes.\n\"I've always been a systems thinker, and our [water] system has inefficiencies in it,\" Love says. \"What we do today is dilute the hell out of our urine, we put it in a pipe, we send it to a treatment plant, and then we pump a bunch more energy into it, just to send it back into the environment in a reactive form.\"\nIn the case of urine's nutrients, its typical destination is waterways. The nitrogen and phosphorus in urine are not fully removed from wastewater when it is treated. When these nutrients find their way into rivers and lakes, they are taken up by algae. The result can be\u00a0algal blooms that choke up waterways, unbalancing the ecosystem and killing other species that live there.\n\"Our bodies create a lot of nutrients, and right now those nutrients are not only wasted, but they\u2019re actually causing a lot of problems and harm downstream,\" says Jamina Shupack, REI's executive director.\nThese nutrients are food for algae \u2013\u00a0but also for crops. \"Wherever you put nitrogen, it's going to help plants grow. So if it's in the water, it's helping the algae grow. But if it's on the land, it's going to help plants grow,\u201d Shupack explains. Because of this, diverting nutrient-rich urine away from waterways and onto the land can prevent harmful algal blooms while helping farmers grow food.\nImportantly, the REI team and the farmers they work with take steps to minimise how much of the urine runs off the land and into waterways. Application is carefully timed, so that it happens when the plant is most able to take up the nutrients \u2013 typically during the plant's more active growth stage, when it's bigger than a seedling but not yet fruiting. The soil moisture is also measured, to make sure the liquid urine will be absorbed. Despite these efforts, \"that doesn't mean that there isn't going to be runoff\", Shupack says.\nEven so, she adds, peecycling reduces the overall amount of nutrients entering waterways because it ensures that runoff from the land is the only way excess nutrients enter rivers and lakes. In the current system, synthetic fertilisers run off into waterways, as well as urine entering rivers directly via wastewater.\nThe UNRP in Vermont is pioneering peecycling in the US, but projects in other countries are also underway. In Paris, volunteers are collecting urine to help save the River Seine and fertilise wheat for baguettes and biscuits. Swedish entrepreneurs saw the harm caused by algal blooms around the island of Gotland and came up with a product that collects urine and turns it into fertiliser. Peecycling pilots have also run in South Africa, Nepal and Niger Republic.\nBut expanding this work comes with challenges. Shupack says that in Vermont, farmers' demand for urine outstrips supply \u2013\u00a0but scaling up collection is tricky. Regulation can create a barrier, she says. \"A lot of times you go to a regulator and they say: 'We don't have a form for urine \u2013 the only place I know where to put urine is with biosolids, or within wastewater treatment.' So it's not really categorised in a way that would make sense to do what we're doing,\" she says.\nTo overcome this, Shupack says that REI have got to grips with the detailed language of regulations so they could spot possible paths and partnered with organisations with existing permits \u2013\u00a0such as septic haulers \u2013\u00a0to tackle the different parts of the process, and the permits needed, in a piecemeal way.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The farmers protecting Nepal's snow leopards\n\u2022\u00a0The rewilded golf courses teeming with life\n\u2022\u00a0The beer sludge being turned into vegan milk\nEamon Twohig, programme manager at Vermont's Department of Environmental Conservation (VTDEC), tells the BBC that when REI initially approached them \"it was clear there was no 'regulatory box' for urine treatment/recycling\u2026 REI has certainly blazed a trail here in Vermont, and I think we've managed to find a workable, regulatory pathway.\"\nREI has a good relationship with regulators in Vermont, Shupack says, and has all the permits needed to operate \u2013\u00a0including one for innovative on-site wastewater management, and a waste-hauling permit for transporting urine. Now the organisation is working with partners in Massachusetts and Michigan to move regulation on. \"We're really trying to push that forward. But it's not always easy to get new environmental regulations updated,\" Shupack says. One of the biggest challenges, she adds, is that there is no legal distinction between human waste that has been separated at source, and combined wastewater flows that often come with greater safety concerns.\u00a0\nThere are other limitations too. Urine is heavy and cumbersome to transport,\u00a0and the lorries collecting and moving it create emissions. Currently the urine in Vermont is transported locally, no more than around 10 miles (16km). But expanding peecycling programmes could involve moving urine across bigger distances, so REI's spinoff company has developed a freeze concentration system that concentrates urine by six times, and is currently being used at the University of Michigan.\nCARBON COUNT\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nPlumbing, too, is a particular challenge. Love says that urine separation systems don't rely on flushing in the same way standard toilets do \u2013\u00a0which is great for reducing water use, but is problematic for the plumbing. When water doesn't flow through the system as usual, there is a risk of diseases\u00a0such as Legionnaires.\n\"There are solutions,\" Love says, \"like looped systems in a building. But what it means is the entire plumbing process in a building is different.\" This is something Love and her colleagues and partners are working on, so that new buildings in the US can have urine separation systems installed from the start. \"If we want any hope of sustainable water systems by the end of this century, we have to start getting the early adopters to look at these innovative solutions now,\" she says.\n\u00a0\nThese new systems will have the important goal of making urine donation effortless. Williams began her peecycling efforts using large laundry detergent bottles that travelled in the boot of her car to a central collection tank once a month. Once she was in the habit of collecting urine, Williams didn't like to let it go to waste. \"I didn't even like to go anywhere where I might have to pee and not have a jug with me. It kind of became part of my routine, sort of like wearing a seat belt,\" she says.\nEven so, she has enjoyed the recent installation of a toilet in her home that separates urine (at the front) from other waste (at the back). The urine travels to a tank in her basement, which is pumped out a couple of times each year by a lorry that visits Williams and others in her area that take part in the project. \"It's a nice change not dealing with the messy business of it. Making it easy for people is a biggie,\" Williams says.\nAvoiding mess is also likely to help tackle the \"ick factor\" when it comes to peecycling, says Williams. \"It's icky and it's smelly and it's something we don't talk about,\" she says. But while some may be put off by the idea of dealing with their own waste, REI's research suggests that the ick factor doesn't dominate people's reactions to peecycling. People tend to be open to the idea, Shupack says, but to think that others wouldn't be. \"It's this assumption that everyone else is going to think it's really gross. That initial ick factor is not as big of a deal as people assume it's going to be,\" says Shupack.\nMany people are, however, concerned about pharmaceutical content in the urine. \"It's the biggest question we get,\" Shupack says. REI has conducted research to find out just how much of common drugs like caffeine and the painkiller acetaminophen are evident in vegetables grown using urine fertiliser. The final results are yet to be released, but the preliminary findings suggest the amount of pharmaceuticals in vegetables fertilised with urine to be \"extremely small\". \"You'd have to eat a pretty obscene amount of lettuce, every day, for way longer than you can live\" to get a cup of coffee's worth of caffeine, Shupack says.\nHealth worries and messiness aside, Williams points out that it is our Western attitude to waste that most urgently needs to change. \"Particularly in [the US], people don't really think about where their waste goes. They think about it in terms of recycling and trash to some degree, but not so much in terms of human waste. It's a new frontier for people.\"\nClimate change and water pollution can feel like impossibly big issues, but Williams doesn't let them overwhelm her. Instead, she focuses on what she can do in a small way, in her own home. \"We can just do our part,\" she says. \"We aren't perfect, but we try to at least be responsible in terms of what happens to our bodily waste.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The World Handicapping System has proved a great talking point in golf clubs across the country\nEavesdrop many a conversation in a golf clubhouse and one could be forgiven for believing that the recreational game is being ruined.\nAt the heart of the complaints is the handicapping system, the mechanism by which varying standards of players compete against each other on level terms.\nBy rating players' abilities, golf has always prided itself on providing a way for the humblest hacker to play against the most proficient of players; with both enjoying a decent contest.\nA little over four years ago a new global scheme, the World Handicapping System (WHS), was introduced. It has proved controversial and, anecdotally, the perception is that it has been a retrograde step.\nWhile the aim was to create an accurate reflection of a golfer's ability to take on any course in the world, many players believe the system is easy to abuse for those wanting to fuel their egos with a low handicap or for those desiring a higher one to be more competitive.\nBut is that a true reflection of how it is or a myth?  Certainly, there is a different view among those who administer the WHS, compared with those grumbling over a post round pint.\nEx-motorcycle gang member reaches Open with win\n67 million to one - Whitnell hits two holes-in-one\nBoom or bust? Golf in flux but is it really thriving?\nIt is an issue that affects millions of golfers across the world and England Golf, the UK's biggest federation, believes the system is working. Furthermore, this is being reflected by the recreational game's increasing popularity.\n\"The reality was, certainly up to the launch of WHS (in November 2020), that there was a decrease every year over a 10-year period with regards to people wanting to play - the numbers of people that played in competitions and then consequently, the number of people that were actually having handicaps,\" Jeremy Tomlinson, England Golf's chief executive told BBC Sport.\nUnder the old CONGU system that prevailed in Great Britain and Ireland, handicaps were effectively determined by performances predominantly in club competitions.\nNow it is easier for regular social golf to count. This includes shorter rounds over nine holes, performances in head-to-head matchplay and while playing with a partner.\nGolfers are able to submit 'general play' scores from rounds with their friends, provided they have specified before teeing off that they want their game to count for handicap purposes.\nThis means more rounds count towards determining a players ability. The best eight scores from your 20 most recent rounds are averaged to provide what is known as a handicap index.\nThis figure is then transportable to any golf course and is used to calculate how many shots you can deduct from your total score. The harder the course, the more shots you receive to reflect the level of difficulty.\nBut the system works on a level of trust. Some players want the lowest possible handicap to help make them eligible for elite amateur events while others desire a few extra shots to help them win swanky competition prizes.\nHandicaps can now be as high as 54 (previously 36) and the average in England is 19. \"The game's gone soft,\" is a regular moan among diehard members.\n\"I think we have a swathe of feeling that there are more people with an opportunity to do well in competitions than before,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"That's probably because the old system lent, we believe, a lot more to towards the lower handicapper.\n\"But of course, there are just more people who have come in.\n\"And more people are doing scores now because more people want a handicap, and then because of that, more people progress on the golfer journey and want to compete.\"\nThere are 722,000 golfers affiliated to England Golf through clubs and the number is continuing to rise. Since November 2020, 38m handicap scores have been submitted to the federation's central database, with 10m in the last year alone.\nPlayers do not have to be a member of a club to gain a handicap, and the Woodhall Spa based organisation offers it's iGolf app as a means for an ever growing number of more nomadic golfers.\n\"We've seen an increase in the number of competition scores, general play scores, 18 holes scores and nine hole scores, which is great and long may it continue,\" England Golf chief operating officer Richard Flint told BBC Sport.\nNevertheless grumbles abound and clubs are being encouraged to take action to maintain the integrity of their competitions. \"Griping is a big word, but I think that those complaining are frustrated that it is different,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"Golf has become a lot more inclusive in providing the opportunity for different people to win, and especially when their handicap is on the way down, while they're getting into golf and getting better and better.\"\nTomlinson added: \"The handicapping system is about integrity. It is more transparent than it's ever been because it is about the scores that you do. But there is a need for check and challenge.\"\nSitting next to the England Golf boss, Flint nodded agreement. He said: \"There is sometimes this thought that, oh, let's just ban the higher handicappers from competitions because they're always winning it.\n\"It's a myth. Clubs can use the terms of competition and have categories, so everyone can play the competition from an inclusivity point of view. Have a prize for the low handicaps as well as mid and high handicapper.\"\nSeveral county unions are now insisting that more scores from competitions, rather than general play, are used to calculate low handicaps when determining eligibility for elite tournaments and representative teams.\n\"We reserve the right to be able to review any handicap that has more than four general play scorecards,\" Tomlinson insisted. \"We have denied players entrance to some of our championships because they've had too many general play cards.\"\nTomlinson insists the authorities, including the R&A and United States Golf Association who brought in WHS, are keen to further the probity of the mechanism.\n\"The R&A are just about to bring out a specification within the system which will identify where they think manipulation's happening,\" he said.\n\"It's another tool that the club handicap committee can use to address that issue. It's not 100%, but it's something that will help.\n\"Ultimately, any system - if people want to manipulate it, they will. It's not the system that's at fault, it's the individuals.\"\nTomlinson believes he is presiding over a growing recreational sport that profited from the bounce golf received by being the first sport people could play after the 2020 Covid pandemic lockdown.\nAs the nation shut down, hundreds of clubs in the UK feared for their future.  Tomlinson sat in emergency meetings across all British sports. \"We were inundated with clubs saying we're going to rack and ruin,\" he recalled.\n\"Amazing. From that point onwards, people were starting to think about their health. Golf clubs became inundated with people writing to them wanting membership, wanting to have playing rights.\n\"And I promise you that the back four weeks of that initial lockdown, I went to those meetings and I hardly said a word because I was watching in my sport compared to sports like swimming, athletics, even cricket that were suffering immeasurably because they weren't able to open up their facilities.\n\"We were building something, and by 13 May when we came out of that lockdown, we'd almost got to zero with regard to our concerns up and down the country because almost every golf club was reporting in that they were filling up.\n\"And of course, by the end of that year, they were pretty much full with waiting lists. That's what happened to golf from from the pandemic.\"\nTomlinson believes his sport, at a recreational level, has been left far healthier as a result. More people are playing at every level, whether on traditional courses or at driving ranges, in simulators or at crazy golf courses.\nHe wants to exploit this enthusiasm to grow the sport by creating pathways from these fringe versions to actual courses, club memberships and handicap competitions.\nDespite anecdotal grumblings, the figures stack up to suggest such movement is occurring. \"And that's brilliant,\" he said.\n\"And to those crusty old golfers; we still love them. We still want to take care of them, but we need them to be a bit more progressive in their thinking.\"",

        "article_text": "Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.\nLocated in Prince George's County, Maryland - one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US - the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.  \nAlthough it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with \"black excellence\", locals told the BBC.\nTo live there, Patricia Gafford says: \"You've got to have money \u2013 lots of it.\"\nThough Mrs Gafford is a dues-paying member of the private country club where she often plays golf, the 73-year-old says she does not live inside the gated community, because, as her husband once told her, \"'it's a little bit too rich for us'\".\nThe setting has also inspired a ground-breaking new soap opera called Beyond the Gates; its second week of programming begins on Monday. Beyond the Gates is the first new daytime soap opera on network TV in over two decades and the first hour-long daytime soap with a predominantly black cast on network TV.\nKristen Warner, an associate professor of performing and media arts at Cornell University, says seeing its release feels long overdue.\n\"Black folks have been huge supporters and viewers of soap operas since its inception,\" she told the BBC.\nYet with over 90 years of soap opera history, there has \"never\" been a black family as the main family from the start of the show, she explains.\nShe says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of \"elegance and glamour and style and fashion\", as well as the trademark \"messiness\" of the day-time plot lines.\nThe show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centres on the Dupree family. While its daily drama-filled plot lines are sure to be, in classic soap opera fashion, over-the-top, the setting was inspired by the very real exclusive enclave inside Prince George's County. \nThe long winding road that leads up to the Country Club at Woodmore is lined with big brick houses built like castles, and surrounded by expansive manicured lawns. A Maserati, Mercedes Benz or something similar decorates most driveways.\nThe depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.\n\"It was kind of like a culture shock for me to see black people with like these mega houses,\" Ms Balgar says. \nIn Woodmore, where census estimates say over 80% of the population is black, the average median household income is over $214,000 (\u00a3170,091). The average in the US is just over $80,000.\nMs Balgar too plays golf on Woodmore's course, where she occasionally hosts events for her women-of-colour centred social club, City Girls Golf. \nShe says Beyond the Gates has been \"all over social\" media and that \"everyone is excited\" about how it's putting a spotlight on a little-known hub of black affluence.\nLong before it was an axis for Washington DC's black elite, in the 1800s, Prince George's County was once known to house the most enslaved African Americans in all of Maryland, says Susan Pearl, a historian at Prince George's County Historical Society.\nOne of the largest plantations in the area, Pleasant Prospect, was located where Woodmore's gated community now stands. The street leading into Woodmore's gates carries the same name.\n\"Some of these wealthy, successful black families are living on land where hundreds of enslaved people were working for one large white property owner,\" says Ms Pearl.\nThe county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after \"a wave of violence\" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.\nBlack Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.\nThe area soon became known for its affluence.\nAt the time, the federal government, which employs many people in nearby Washington, DC, was one of the first to implement anti-discrimination policies, giving black Americans a rare chance at better opportunities and better pay.\nFederal jobs \"played a huge role\" in creating black economic success, Ms Davis says, leading to Prince George's County eventually becoming the wealthiest majority-black county in the US.\nBy the late 80s, \"McMansions\" owned by black families began popping up, she added.\nMeanwhile, the county's white population continued to decline as large numbers of white residents began leaving the District of Columbia area in a phenomenon called \"white flight\".\nYet it wasn't until 1992 that the Country Club at Woodmore admitted its first black member - nearly 70 years after the club first opened, in 1923. He died last year.\nThe history-making Beyond the Gates arrives at a \"strange time\", media professor Ms Warner says: \"The soap opera is nearly extinct.\"\nFor most of soap opera history, she explains, black characters were secondary to the story, introduced through the lives of white families, initially in roles like housekeeper, then later as cops and lawyers.\nNBC soap opera Generations made history in 1989 when it became the first to feature a black family from the beginning, but this will be the first soap to make a black family the star of the central plot.\nThe soap is also airing amid a backlash - spearheaded by President Donald Trump's administration - against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\nBeyond the Gates was born out of a collaboration between CBS and the NAACP in 2020, following the social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a gesture of \"goodwill\" that Ms Warner says is now being \"rolled back\".\n\"In the midst of everything being taken away, we have this one little moment where there is something there for us,\" Ms Warner says, referring to the soap.\nThe club's black members say that despite a shifting political climate, Woodmore - with its rolling hills and towering pine trees - remains a safe, familiar space. \n\"When I come onto the grounds, I see people who look like me,\" says Mrs Gafford, a member.\n\"It's great to come in and see Brent (Taliaferro) behind the counter,\" she adds, referencing the club's assistant golf pro, who is also black. \n\"We all feel like we're one big family - the Woodmore family,\" he agrees. \nThere are few people at Woodmore's club Mr Taliaferro doesn't know, including Hope Wiseman, who grew up inside the gates of Woodmore.\nShe believes the name of the new soap opera is aptly titled.\n\"Everybody wants to be behind the gates, so it's funny they called it Beyond the Gates. Everybody wants to see kind of what's back there,\" Ms Wiseman says.\nShe opened a cannabis dispensary down the road in 2018, making her the youngest black woman at the time to own one.\nIt's success stories like these and people like Ms Wisemen - black entrepreneurs and black dentists, like her mom - that aren't on TV screens enough, she says.\nThat's why Ms Wiseman says she is pleased to see this new soap opera depicting her community.\n\"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to grow up around and operate in an environment where there's black excellence all around you,\" she says.\n\"That's not the experience of most of black America. That's exciting to see on TV.\"",

        "article_text": "YouTube started out as an off-beat video sharing site. But at its 20th anniversary, the platform's content has fundamentally altered the way we think, feel and interact with each other.\nIn 2006, Time Magazine named its annual Person of the Year: you. \"Yes you,\" the magazine read. \"You control the Information Age. Welcome to your world.\" Its cover featured a mirror to reflect reader's image \u2013 emblazoned on a computer screen tuned to a site modelled after YouTube. It was just a year after YouTube's launch, but already, it had shifted our understanding of the role we would play in the coming era.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of YouTube. It's gone from a novel tool to an unshakable pillar of technological infrastructure. Some 2.5 billion people log on every month. The company says people who watch YouTube on their TVs consume a billion hours of video a day, to say nothing of time spent on the app and website. But as much as YouTube changed how we use the internet, it's had an equally significant impact on our offline lives.\n\"Not long ago virtually no one took YouTube that seriously,\" journalist Mark Bergen writes in his book Like, Comment, Subscribe. \"But in so many ways, YouTube had set the stage for modern social media, making decisions throughout its history that shaped how attention, money, ideology, and everything else worked online.\"\nYouTube videos have occupied a massive share of our collective consciousness, dictating what brings us together, what drives us apart, what makes us laugh, cry and cringe. \"All the dynamics of social media \u2013 of attention, fame, disrupting old school media \u2013 have mostly grown because of the financial model YouTube built,\" Bergen tells the BBC. Human nature itself has shifted in the last 20 years, and as seen in these five videos, YouTube would become a nexus point for the way we see ourselves and each other.\nLong before the video stitching on TikTok or remixing on Instagram reels, there was Canon Rock, uploaded just 10 months after YouTube's founding. South Korean musician Jeong-Hyun Lim, known online as funtwo, sits in his bedroom with an electric guitar, his face hidden beneath a baseball cap and pixelated footage. A backing track plays the chords to Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D, and Lim joins in, his guitar work subdued in line with the 300-year-old piece. But Lim's playing \u00a0grows more intricate until, about 40 seconds in, he launches into a blazing solo, fingers gliding across the fretboard.\nThe reaction was explosive. As the video racked up hits, around 900 users sent direct video responses to Canon Rock \u2013 big numbers at a time when uploading videos meant plugging in a digital camera \u2013 and thousands more posted their own covers of the song. In 2007, YouTube user Impeto uploaded a compilation of dozens of Canon Rock videos edited into one continuous track, almost as though the whole internet was playing along together. Deft musicianship wasn't new to the web, but the user participation was.\nCanon Rock created a \"reciprocity between artists\" that opened the door for people to see each other as creative partners, says Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor of communication at Cornell University in the US. By democratising the creative process, YouTube created a melting pot for different communities with different interests and skills to make the internet their own.\nYouTube turns 20\nFor more on the world's biggest video platform, read our story on the YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know.\nIt helped inspire a new era of online collaboration, according to Jean Burgess, a digital media professor at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Videos like funtwo's weren't just a performance, Burgess says, they were an invitation, a \"showcasing of skill and the setting of standards for other players in the 'game' to attain or beat\".\nToday's video platforms bombard us with marketing partnerships and endless threads of political discourse. But the musicians behind Canon Rock represented a simpler time, where collaboration was not an economic or ideological proposition, but instead a space where online bedroom dwellers were learning to see each other as members of a global community, a project they were all embarking on together.\nEarly YouTube audiences will probably be familiar with the saga of Bree, better known by the username lonelygirl15. Her story began as a homeschooled girl posting simple videos about her daily life. But things took a bizarre turn when Bree discovered her family was involved with a strange religious cult. Over the weeks and months, the narrative grew more convoluted; Bree ultimately went on the run, investigating secret codes, eluding religious acolytes and fighting a sinister organisation.\nIt was all fiction, of course. But lonelygirl15's start was so mundane that many didn't question the story until the drama was too fantastic to ignore. \"Bree\" had an enigmatic realness \u2013 she was actively connecting with fans on MySpace and corresponding with journalists, and even the New York Times was still asking whether the series was truth or a hoax before the final episode. It sparked ferocious debate in online forums, with viewers picking apart everything from her narrative to the quality of her video production.\n\"[Lonelygirl15] seemed to captivate so many, drawing people who maybe didn\u2019t know what YouTube really was into the fold,\" says Duffy. \"The authenticity, the relatability, the vulnerability, the expressive sharing.\"\nBeyond satire, the series was a pointed effort to use the tropes and norms of social media to misguide the audience. It marked a major development on the internet, where some realised for the first time just how blurry the lines between fact and fiction had become, Duffy says.\nLonelygirl15 was a sea change for many users' relationships to each other, and it forced some people to examine the identities that they themselves were creating online, Bergen says. \"In some ways, the lonelygirl15 series was ahead of its time,\" he says. \"It was a clever commentary about the fact that authenticity doesn't really exist online \u2013 you're always a persona, even if you're not acting as one.\"\nIt raised questions about discerning truth on the web, and helped establish a new order where every post, no matter how innocuous, is subject to interrogation and distrust.\nIt's 2011. A young man sits in front of a map of the world. His hands and voice are shaky as he calls his father on the phone. The man is Randy Phillips, an airman in the US Air Force, and he is filming himself telling his dad that he is gay.\nPhillips ran a channel called \"AreYouSurprised\" detailing his life under the US's \"Don't ask, don't tell\" policy. In his previous videos, Phillips positioned the camera to keep his face just out of view, but hours after the 16-year policy was repealed, he was on full display. Phillips wasn't the only one. His post was an early example of the \"coming out\" video, a YouTube genre that became more and more influential as time went on.\n\"Watching real LGBTQ+ people share their own coming out journeys across platforms like YouTube definitely provided an opportunity for queer and transgender people all over the world to realise they were not alone,\" says Zach Eisenstein, director of communications at The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group.\u00a0\"When YouTube was just starting up, I was a teenager figuring out my own identity,\" he says. \"It helped me exponentially as I navigated my own coming out journey.\"\nThe offline world was in the throes of change. It would be four years until the US Supreme Court legalised gay marriage, but following a global economic recession that highlighted growing inequality and shifting political climates, social attitudes were becoming more inclusive.\nTyler Oakley, one of the first major openly gay personalities on the platform, launched the \"Coming Out\" challenge in 2011, encouraging his audience and fellow creators to proudly share their sexual orientations and experiences. YouTubers like Hannah Hart, Ingrid Nilsen and singer Troye Sivan garnered a collective 2.8 million views on their coming out videos. Olympic diver Tom Daley came out in a 2013 video, receiving support from his fans and fellow athletes.\n\"People find creators that speak to them, and very often watch them and get to know them and trust them and are influenced by them in a way that no other platform touches,\" says Ben Relles, former head of comedy at YouTube and cofounder of the YouTube channel Barely Political. The way we present ourselves differs between coworkers, family, friends and strangers, but YouTube circumvented those social links. LGBTQ+ creators leveraged the relationships \u00a0with their audiences to make it plain that people with different sexual identities did not just exist, they were no different than every other person.\n\"Through the good, the bad, and the ugly of the internet, social media has given people a unique ability to find safe and welcoming online communities \u2013 especially when they don\u2019t feel accepted in their in-person ones,\" Eisenstein says.\n\"This is for my 12-year-old self,\" begins Australian YouTuber Essena O'Neill in what she called her last ever YouTube video in 2015. Over the next 17 minutes, O'Neill broke down her decision to quit all social media and made a passionate plea to her followers to do the same. O'Neill's story took aim at the \"contrived\" reality of video and social media production, and its harmful effects on mental health. It was a sign of things to come.\n\"Running a channel is very much like running a treadmill,\" says Matt Koval, a filmmaker and YouTube's former head creator liaison. \"If you stop, if you get off the treadmill for a long period of time, your viewers are going to move on and start watching other people just by nature, and it can be difficult to come back.\" And many creators, even as far back as YouTube's early days, never did.\nQuitting videos have become a social media subgenre unto themselves in the past decade \u2013 people in the public eye realising that they've taken on too much, or that they need a break. But O'Neill's departure helped spark a broader conversation.\n\"People are so dismissive of influencers and creators,\" says Duffy. \"What creative workers experience really presages wider trends in the economy.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\n\u2022 How a tiny village became India's YouTube capital\n\u2022 The ghosts of India's TikTok\nIt wasn't just creators facing burnout online. In the early days, social media was sold as utopian opportunity, a place where people would come together to share ideas beyond the constraints of traditional gatekeepers. But as time went by, a new discussion emerged about social media's potentially addictive qualities and negative effects on our time, attention and mental health.\nThanks in part to a push from creators like O'Neill, who offered their own experience as a model, conversations about our own relationships to the internet began to shift. Ten years later, we've reached the point the point that officials describe social media as a full on public health crisis \u2013 but that shift in thinking hasn't been enough to keep people off the internet. Social media usage on YouTube and elsewhere is higher than ever, and these days, O'Neill herself is back online.\nA spokesperson for Google, YouTube's parent company, says the platform works hard to ensure it's providing a healthy and fulfilling network, both for creators and users who just come to watch. \"Each YouTube creator has a different definition of success, and we have support mechanisms in place and continue to build a community that allows creators to thrive based on their individual needs and business aspirations,\" the spokesperson says. \"We want creators to make their videos in a healthy, sustainable way, and creating engaging content should always take priority over producing a certain quantity of videos.\" YouTube has invested in a number of efforts to promote mental health among its users and across the globe.\nMore people than ever were watching YouTube videos in the 2010s, with the site averaging one billion users a month by 2013, according to the company. But as YouTubers became more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions, some of those feelings turned towards the platform itself.\nFor years, YouTube released an annual recap video looking back at the service's biggest cultural trends. What began as a one-and-a-half-minute round-up turned into big budget productions, bringing together a growing roster of notable creators and celebrities recreating viral moments set to remixed tracks of hit songs. It was a fairly well-received \u2013 until 2018.\nWithin a week, YouTube Rewind 2018 racked up over 10 million dislikes, making it the most-disliked YouTube post of all time. Critics panned the video, including the CEO of YouTube's own daughter, arguing the company was promoting a self-serving view of the platform geared towards its own corporate interests, one that glossed how people were actually using and responding to the service. \"The community, which was once celebrated by YouTube, no longer feels included in the culture YouTube wants to promote,\" reporter Julia Alexander wrote at the time. The speed and scope of the reaction was unlike anything the company had seen before.\n\"For a long time, YouTube has been pretty tolerant of its creators' and audiences' criticisms. I think that's the sort of atmosphere where it's totally permissible for the audience to get really mad at the company,\" says Bergen. But \"the company has never been great at reading the room\".\nDespite the criticism, YouTube maintains that it's an inclusive space built to allow its community to thrive and feel empowered. \"YouTube has not only democratized content, but democratized opportunity,\" a Google spokesperson says. \"At YouTube, we developed a comprehensive approach aimed to ensure we\u2019re a video streaming platform for high-quality content.\" That includes a set of robust community guidelines, the spokesperson says, one the company works to apply equally to all users in order to combat the spread of harmful content and build a healthy environment that lets users flourish.\nRewind 2018 revealed a festering hostility that grew in the online space. \"There was a marked shift,\" Duffy says. In the earliest days, discussions about YouTube centered around the idea that it promoted a culture of positivity. YouTube's original slogan was \"Broadcast Yourself\" \u2013 creators and users saw the website as a project they were all working on together. But as time wore on, an adversarial tone erupted on the platform, Duffy says, and many started to feel the YouTube they helped build had become too powerful.\nThe biggest change, perhaps, was how people understood the role they played on the platform; once they were creating YouTube, but now, they were just using it.\n--\nFor timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to the Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "This year's Oscars had it all - glamour, tears and the Wicked stars defying gravity. Here are some of the top moments from the biggest night in Hollywood.\nThere was an audible gasp from journalists in the winners' room when Mikey Madison was announced as the best actress winner. \nDemi Moore was the favourite for much of this campaign. Things did shift after Madison's Bafta win, but the race remained incredibly tight.\nIn the end, it was Madison's night. It marked an incredible moment for a 25-year-old actress who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nThe film tells the story of sex worker Anora, who has a whirlwind ill-fated romance with the spoilt son of a Russian oligarch.\nEdie Turquet, one of the young female dancers and strippers in the film, texted me to say it was \"insane\" that a film about sex workers could win best picture at the Oscars.\nShe added that she hoped it would \"shift or at least challenge\" perspectives of people towards her community.\nWe all knew it was coming but Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande belting out Wicked's anthem Defying Gravity was even better than we could have hoped for.\nAs Erivo, in a white gown, hit that final iconic note, the audience stood in applause.\nThe co-stars performed a medley of songs, including Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which Grande sang to open the show wearing a gorgeous red sequined dress.\nEarlier in the night, Grande stunned on the red carpet with a champagne Schiaparelli gown, which leaned into her role as Glinda the Good Witch in the film.\n\"It's giving chandelier,\" one reporter said to me backstage.\nOn social media the big question was: \"How is she going to sit down in that dress?\"\nOn the red carpet, there was quite a moment when Halle Berry ran up to Adrien Brody and gave him a big kiss. \nIt recreated a moment at the 2003 Academy Awards, when Brody - having just won best actor for his performance in The Pianist - turned and kissed Berry, who had presented the award to him.\nShe told Variety: \"I had to pay him back\".\nSpeaking to Extra, she added that the only reason she did it was because Brody's girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, \"was fine\" with it.\nThe Oscars wrote on X with a clip of the kiss: \"A reunion 22 years in the making\".\nBerry and Brody weren't the only two seen locking lips.\nInside the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre, lovebirds Kylie Jenner and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were photographed sharing a kiss and laughing together.\nReality star and makeup mogul Jenner was there to support her boyfriend who was up for best actor - but ended up losing out to... Brody.\nActor Adam Sandler was in on the ongoing jokes about his typically casual attire.\nEarly on in the night, host Conan O'Brien called him out, saying he was \"dressed like a guy playing video poker at 2am\".\n(For reference, Sandler was in the audience wearing a blue hoodie and shorts, an ensemble that looked more at home on the basketball court).\nFollowing a playful back and forth between the two, the actor walked into the aisle of the theatre and said he was \"leaving\" before going over to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and shouting his surname, in the way he previously did on Saturday Night Live.\nChalamet, ever good natured, laughed along.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, which killed 29 people. \nThe Grammys and Golden Globes both made the fires a central theme of the show.\nThe Academy Awards mentioned it only a handful of times, signalling Hollywood is moving on.\nThere was, however, one powerful moment, when O'Brien welcomed some of the firefighters who fought the blazes on stage. He called them \"heroes\", with the audience clapping and giving the emergency workers a standing ovation.\nO'Brien then said there are some jokes that even he isn't brave enough to tell - and asked some of the firefighters to read them out instead. \nLA Fire Captain Erik Scott read one joke off a teleprompter that said their hearts go out to everyone who lost their homes - including the makers of Joker 2.\nIt got a big laugh and O'Brien called it the best joke delivery of the night.\nIt was Zoe Salda\u00f1a's first Oscar, winning best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez - a musical about a transgender Mexican drug lord - and it marked one of the most powerful and emotional speeches of the night. \nShe broke down in tears immediately, crying out \"Mommy\", to her mother in the audience.\n\"I am floored by this honour,\" she wept, paying tribute to her fellow nominees for their \"loving and community\", saying \"I will pay it forward\".\nPraising the film's cast and crew, she got emotional as she talked about her family.\n\"Everything brave, outrageous and good I've ever done in my life is because of you,\" she said, praising her husband, his \"beautiful hair\" and their three sons.\n\"My grandmother came to this country in 1961 - I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands.\n\"I'm the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award and I know I won't be the last.\n\"Getting an award where I got to sing and speak in Spanish - this is for my grandmother.\"\nThe month-long saga to obtain a US visa by two Iranian filmmakers ended in the pair winning the best animated short film Academy Award - with them rushing to even make the ceremony in Hollywood. \nHossein Molayemi and Shirin Sohani arrived at Los Angeles airport just hours before the Oscars award ceremony was due to begin.\nAfter their plane landed, they quickly changed outfits in a public restroom and made it with only moments to go before winning the award for their film, In the Shadow of the Cypress.\n\"It's not our fault we are so late,\" Sohani said to BBC News before the show. \"We couldn't get a visa. It's a difficult relationship\" between the US and Iran, she explained.\n\"Until yesterday we hadn't obtained our visa and now we are standing here with this statuette in our hands,\" said Molayemi in his acceptance speech.\n\"Speaking in front of this expectant audience is very hard for us,\" he added. \"Yes, if we preserve and remain faithful, miracles will happen.\"\nAs ever, politics reared its head during Sunday night's ceremony.\nHost O'Brien made a quip about how Anora was \"having a good night\", before saying: \"I guess Americans are excited to see somebody finally stand up to a powerful Russian.\"\nO'Brien must have been writing his monologue up to the very last minute, because the joke appeared to be a nod to the White House spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump.\nMeanwhile, the No Other Land documentary team descended on the red carpet wearing Palestinian scarves and Kufiya. Their film is set in the occupied West Bank. After they won for the film, the team took the stage and called out US policy in the region.\nKill Bill star Daryl Hannah also veered into politics while on stage. She referenced the war in Ukraine, saying \"Slava Ukraini\", the country's salute, as she presented an award.\nBut one person wasn't mentioned. \nHere in liberal Hollywood, you may have expected jokes and barbs toward Donald Trump - but his name didn't come up even once.",

A 90-4 defeat by Australia was the biggest the Lionesses - either as England or Great Britain - have ever suffered.\nBoth captain Cunningham and centre Hardcastle, interviewed on the pitch moments after a shattering result, were quick to pinpoint the reasons for it: they couldn't get enough of the ball, and so ended up spending much of the 70 minutes trying to defend against the best team in the world.\nHow to use that as a learning experience to avoid a repeat is a tougher question - and one that goes to the heart of the structure of women's rugby league in England.\nThe effort from Stuart Barrow's team never wavered, even as hopes of running their opponents close were shredded. The fact they scored the final try of the match, having conceded 17 before that, spoke volumes of their capacity to keep going.\nThat, in itself, required huge reserves of character.\n\"I think we know what we need to do when we go back home,\" Hardcastle said. \"You can't take anything away from the Jillaroos. \n\"They're absolute athletes and what they get to do in Australia, and how professional they are, and the backing that they get is incredible. And to face them at a top level, it's a privilege to be here.\n\"We've lost, but to be able to be here and give it a go and know what it's like in that battle, in that washing machine, it's been worth that 70 minutes.\"\nThe size of the defeat clearly hurt.\n\"There are always positives to take,\" Cunningham said. \"Right now, it's tough to focus on them, but I think the heart was there, the effort was there, we didn't give up. \n\"I think Georgia Roche getting a try for us right at the end shows that we didn't give up.

But we've got a great squad, we've got a great group of staff and we're willing to put that hard work in to get better.\"\nIn a recent interview with BBC Sport, former Great Britain head coach Jackie Sheldon highlighted the investment Australia have put into their women's game over the past two decades as a key factor in their international dominance - they have won the past three World Cups, and lost just once since 2016.\nShe suggested England have to find a way to compete physically with Australia and New Zealand in order to be able to challenge them.\nGiven the disparity in investment between the domestic game in England and Australia, that may not be a quick process. It may be helped, though, by the experience gained by English players who have moved to the NRLW: Roche plays her club rugby for Newcastle Knights, and Hollie-Mae Dodd for Canberra Raiders, while Paige Travis will start the coming season with Parramatta Eels, having switched from St Helens.\nPerhaps, in time, the painful memories of Vegas will make England better too. As Hardcastle put it: \"The result's hard, but there's a lot we can look at individually, and think: what do we need to do to be better?\"",

Later that day, his body was found at the foot of a cliff by an off-duty policeman on a waterbike.\nLee does not believe Nathan made the journey to the remote location in the opposite direction to his hotel on his own, and said it would take an hour to walk up there. \nHe added Nathan had \"no reason to be up there\". \n\"We strongly believe he was taken up there, whether it was by taxi or against his own will,\" Lee said. \"And something has happened for him to be found where he was found.\"\nThe family said the day after his death attempts were made to use Nathan's bank cards, but this was not followed up by the authorities.\nAlannah and Lee have also been tracing Nathan's known movements on the night. They said he had been on a video call with one of his friends until his phone battery ran out.\nCarrying out their own investigations, the family discovered Nathan on public CCTV on the promenade, where they said he did not appear significantly intoxicated. They have found other premises with CCTV, but said the owners would not pass on any recordings without a request from the Spanish authorities. \nThe family said they had repeatedly tried to find out how the investigation into Nathan's death was progressing, but have been met with silence.\nThey recently received a police file which Alannah said was \"empty\", with the case described as closed.\nNathan's mother Elizabeth said there was \"no empathy\" from the Spanish police immediately after his death and claimed they were \"treated like dogs\". \nElizabeth said she had to identify her son by being shown a photo of a tattoo on his torso.\nShe said not knowing how he ended up at the remote location is torturous.\n\"Our boy deserves answers and we as a family deserve answers.

        "article_text": "The Brit Awards belonged to Charli XCX on Saturday night, who completed her transformation from underground hero to bona fide pop star by winning five awards including best artist and song of the year.\nEzra Collective, Sam Fender, Stormzy and The Last Dinner Party were the other big British winners on Saturday night, while Fontaines DC and Chappell Roan bagged the international awards. \nThe night also included a memorable, blush-inducing performance from US pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter, who was handed the global success award at London's O2 Arena.\nThe arena fell silent near the end of the show for a moving video tribute to the late Liam Payne, who died last October.\nDespite not performing, Charli XCX stole the show by winning the biggest awards of the night - artist of the year, album of the year for her cultural phenomenon Brat, and song of the year for Guess.\n\"This is cool, I'm really happy that a song about underwear now has a Brit award, very important stuff\", said Charli, dryly, on stage after collecting her first award.\n \"I'm sure that that proves something about songwriting but I'm not sure what.\"\nShe went on to thank Eilish - the first non-Brit to appear on a best song-winner - for her guest vocals on Guess which she delivered at just three days notice. \"Thank you Billie for running and gunning...\"\nThe 32-year-old from Essex also picked up the best dance act and songwriter of the year awards.\nIn her speech for best dance act, she spoke of the importance of the night-time genre. \"I feel like dance music, electronic music gets a really bad rep' because everyone is like, 'it's not that deep, is it?'. And I kind of feel it is,\" she said.\n\"This genre of music for me is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nAs she collected her fifth and final award of the night for best album, Charli told the crowd how she had \"always felt like an outsider\" up until this point.\n\"Culture caught up with us and wanted to be on the journey with us - I am living proof that it takes a long time but you don't need to compromise your vision,\" she added.\nIt's always difficult getting the tone of the opening performance right - but Carpenter certainly nailed the brief with her mash-up of mega-hit Espresso and recent favourite from her best-selling album, Bed Chem.\nFans of the star who have been eagerly following her Short n' Sweet Tour will have recognised some elements of it in her Brits performance - which was given a suitably British update with the opening strains of Rule Britannia and a, ahem, close encounter with a beefeater.\nCarpenter also became the first international star to accept the global success award, jokingly saying it was \"an insane honour, for such a tea-drinking country you streamed the [heck] out of espresso.\"\nWearing some lingerie that might have been a little bit too racy for the pre-watershed slot, her performance around a heart-shaped bed was energetic and embodied her cheeky style that has elevated her fame in recent months.\nBest pop act winner, Jade - of little mix Fame - attempted to top this with a performance of her song Angel Of My Dreams.\nIn it she appeared in a blonde wig and big white fur coat before disappearing briefly somewhere in a crowd of dancers and re-emerging as an angel suspended above the stage. \nSeveral artists used their winning platform to urge the powers-that-be to do more to protect artists and give them the time, space and funds to develop.\nJazz group Ezra Collective - who closed the night with an upbeat performance alongside Jorja Smith - won group of the year, with Femi Koleoso expressing that giving a young person at a youth club a trumpet, for example, could help to fix \"so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK\".\nChappell Roan, who won best international act and international song for Good Luck, Babe!, noted via a video link how she had to write \"a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones\".\nRising star winner Myles Smith - or \"The Luton Bob Dylan\", as host Jack Whitehall called him - performed his hit Stargazing and called on the government to stop treating British music as an \"after thought\" while urging the music industry itself to stick with artists past their first viral hits and tours.\nIt was also a night that marked the return of Sam Fender, with the Geordie singer-songwriter picking up the best alternative/rock act.\nHe thanked his band in his speech, saying he would just be a \"mad man shouting at walls\" without them.\nIt marks the end of a huge week for Fender, who also topped the UK album charts with People Watching - which had the biggest opening week for a British album since Harry Styles' Harry's House in 2022.\nHe topped off the evening with an emphatic performance of its title track.\nBest hip-hop winner Stormzy thanked Jesus and read a verse from the bible before explaining that he was wearing shades as he had \"mashed my eye up playing padel\".\nBest R&B act winner Raye said via video that she was \"still recovering\" from last year's event when she won a record-breaking six awards.\nDublin rock band Fontaines D.C said they were \"buzzing\" to win best international group and did so, fittingly, from Down Under.\nAnd Teddy Swims performed his hit Lose Control on a flame-filled stage - a potential fire hazard in his baggy oversized jacket - before Lola Young played her viral hit in a Messy makeshift room.\nIt's four years since Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards - with Mo Gilligan filling the gap - and he noted how broadcasters ITV \"had to come crawling back to an ex\" in asking him back.\nHe poked fun at the stars in the audience, underlining how Charli, in true British style, \"had asked not to perform on the show so she can get drunk\".\nAnd referencing Stormzy's recent high profile adverts, he called the star \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald - he's loving it\".\nAiming a light dig at YouTuber KSI, the host joked: \"You are as good a rapper as Aitch... from Steps\".\nHaving flown over from US filming commitments a few days ago, he showed little signs of jet lag in his bid to \"Make the Brits Great Again\", as he had joked in a pre-show video this week.\n\"If you thought Trump-Zelensky was cringe then wait until you hear me...\" he quipped.\nIt reached peak cringe though when his parents appeared alongside him in one segment, with his dad dressed as Kanye West.\nThe biggest cheer of the night came when actor Danny Dyer told Whitehall that \"the world is being run by cranks\".\nLiam Payne, who tragically died in Argentina aged 31, had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist.\nThe ceremony included a touching tribute to the star, which was a bit of a gear shift towards the end of the fun-packed show, as Whitehall queued up a sombre black and white montage of Payne's career, including music and quotes from him and his bandmates.\n\"I hope that me singing today brings enjoyment to someone,\" he was heard saying.\nSeven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa won nothing on the night despite having received four nominations.\nThere were also snubs for royal royalty The Beatles, Coldplay and The Cure, who like Dua, all lost out to Charli in various catergories.\nLet's hope they're not too Bratty about it.",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "article_text": "Amanda Pritchard, head of NHS England, would have regular Monday meetings with Health Secretary Wes Streeting to review performance and address challenges. But last Monday was different. After discussing the state of the health service, she announced she was stepping down - with just one month's notice.\nIt came as a shock to many in the organisation, under which there are 1.4 million staff who deal with 1.7 million patients everyday. But those in the know had suspected something was happening - though not the timing.\nThat meeting between Pritchard and Streeting was the natural conclusion of changes which had been rumbling on in the corridors of power for some time.\nNHS England was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2013. The aim was to free the organisation from interference by politicians.\nUnder Sir Simon Stevens - now Lord Stevens - NHS England developed into what looked like a rival power base and led by an alternative health secretary. He was at the heart of work drawing up long-term NHS plans under David Cameron and Theresa May. Lord Stevens knew his way around Whitehall and knew how to win backroom battles with ministers.\nAmanda Pritchard had been deputy to Lord Stevens since 2019 and played a vital role in the NHS response to the pandemic, including the vaccine roll-out. It had seemed inevitable she would take over the top job in 2021. Understandably, she expected to continue in the same vein as her predecessor. But with the arrival of a Labour government last year that certainty began to weaken.\nThe first clue that things would be going back to a more traditional management regime, with more direct government control, came when two health experts were appointed from previous Labour governments: Alan Milburn, Blair's health secretary, and Paul Corrigan, an adviser. It became clear that they would be involved in shaping policy with Wes Streeting.\nOne well-placed health source said those two \"remembered the old days\", before the NHS's shift to autonomy, which they felt made the system \"too bureaucratic\".\nAnother clue came when work began on a new NHS 10-year plan for England. With previous plans Lord Stevens had \"held the pen\", but this time the government brought in Sally Warren from the King's Fund think tank - outside NHS England management - to head up the the work.\nAt the same time, noises were being made about slimming down NHS England management - and instead devolving money to local health boards and patient services. Government sources deny that NHS England is being subsumed into the health department but say it will have a \"leaner\" role, cutting out duplication.\nAmanda Pritchard was well aware of the direction of travel. She could see that her job was going to change and had considered stepping down later this year. There has been no suggestion of any row or confrontation with Wes Streeting.\nNHS officials say that the decision to leave at the end of March was because it will be the end of a financial year - and there was no need to stay for the launch of the 10-year plan in the early summer.\nIn January Ms Pritchard had a bruising experience at the hands of two parliamentary select committees. One suggested she and colleagues were \"complacent\" and another said they were disappointed with \"lengthy and diffuse answers\". In a BBC interview she admitted that \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings\" but it was right to be scrutinised. Privately, according to sources, she found the process \"frustrating given how much time she had given to the role\" under some of the most difficult years in the history of the NHS.\nShe will be replaced by Sir Jim Mackey, an experienced NHS trust boss, who is being titled the \"transition\" chief executive. Policy will be run by Wes Streeting's department with Sir Jim, we are told, focusing on delivery including cutting the hospital waiting list of nearly 7.5 million. He had recently helped draft a recovery plan for planned treatment and appointments.\nSo where does all this leave the NHS?\nOn one hand, Amanda Pritchard has provided consistent leadership in various roles under six different health secretaries. The autonomy of NHS England enabled its chief executive to bang the drum for the health service and pressure the government.\nBut on the other hand, serious problems remain with patient outcomes and those closer to Streeting argue more direct government control means less bureaucracy, and the ability to free up resources to deploy where needed.\nOne health source argued that the upcoming changes would end confusion over policy and strategy and encourage collaboration between ministers and NHS England - without being a formal takeover. But another suggested it was \"a bit of a mess\" and there could now be instability and distractions for NHS administrators when they need to focus on wider health challenges.\nMuch will depend on how much money is allocated in the Treasury spending review.\nIt's patients that matter - and it's not yet clear whether or not these changes will help them.",

        "article_text": "The recently opened Pekoe Trail, which runs for more than 300km through tea plantations, villages and forests, tells the story of Sri Lanka's complex and chequered tea history.\nThe sun is bright and harsh on my face when I stop to admire the view \u2013 okay, to catch my breath \u2013 at the top of the steep path. How is it that just 20 minutes ago, the skies were grey and moody with the threat of an imminent downpour? In Sri Lanka's central highlands, the weather may be capricious but what remains unchanged is the sprawling expanse of tea estates in every direction.\u00a0\nThis region is where the bulk of soothing Ceylon tea comes from. And the recently opened Pekoe Trail, Sri Lanka's first long-distance hiking trail that runs for more than 300km through tea plantations, villages and forests, tells the story of Sri Lanka's complex and chequered tea history. This hiking trail, divided into 22 stages, begins in Sri Lanka's second largest city of Kandy, close to the area where Scotsman James Taylor first planted tea in the country in the mid-1800s. After a long and circuitous route, it finally ends in the hill town of Nuwara Eliya, whose cool climes and misty slopes are said to have reminded the British colonisers of Blighty (Britain).\u00a0\nThe trail has existed in patches since those initial days of tea cultivation in Sri Lanka, beginning as basic mud tracks that were used to transport the leaves to factories and then onward to domestic markets and Colombo port for export. For Pekoe Trail founder and sustainable tourism consultant Miguel Cunat, creating this multi-stage, multi-day hike was a labour of love, involving nearly 10 years of research and exploration.\n\"My initial objective was to promote Sri Lanka as a world-class hiking destination,\" says the Spaniard and long-time Sri Lanka resident, who was keen to put the small island back on the tourism map after a disastrous spell with Covid and the subsequent economic crisis. His efforts came to fruition with the official opening of the Pekoe Trail in late 2023, with initial funding from the European Union and USAID.\n\"The trails are fairly easy, at low elevation and open all through the year. In that sense, this hike is for everyone,\" he explains. That means everyone, including novice hikers such as myself, have the option to stay in a hotel near the trail and go out on exploratory day hikes within a single stage. I also come to understand later from my trail guides that most visitors choose to do this instead of attempting the trail in its entirety.\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nAnd although tea is the common thread stitching this story together, each stage has its own unique elements \u2013 a colonial-era cricket club here, a seasonal waterfall there, statues of brightly coloured village deities, Anglican churches with brilliant stained-glass windows, distant views of a sharp peak or clusters of wildflowers blooming in the midst of a barren stretch. Cathy Cruse, a 62-year-old Australian hiker who recently set a record by completing the entire trail in seven days, agrees, saying, \"You've got the tea plantations and then you're going into thick jungle and then pine forests, and then at one stage I thought I was walking through Australia, with all the tall eucalyptus trees.\"\nCunat's objective was also to bring tourist attention and money into the hinterlands and hill towns located away from the popular coastal destinations of Sri Lanka's south or the Buddhist Cultural Triangle of Anuradhapura, Sigiriya and Dambulla. Cruse, who is married to a Sri Lankan, says that she has visited Kandy and Nuwara Eliya several times but never had a chance \u2013 or indeed, a reason \u2013 to explore the more interior parts of the tea country.\nAs Cunat walked along the various trails, he also began to see a larger picture emerging from the network of villages and communities along the way. \"Along with nature, there is so much history and living heritage, with local fairs and festivals, and opportunities to see how [rural Sri Lankans] live and work,\" he says. And it is this aspect I most enjoy about my hikes \u2013 I am never too far from civilisation, be it a local temple or a tea factory, and I get to have regular interactions with friendly plantation workers and curious children everywhere. It is perhaps why Cruse stresses how safe the trail is for solo or women hikers. \"When I pick a trail, I'm looking for somewhere safe that a woman can tackle on her own and not feel intimidated. Not once did I ever feel nervous of my surroundings or my guides on the Pekoe Trail,\" she says.\nThe history of tea in Sri Lanka is inextricably linked with the Indian-Tamil plantation workers brought by the British. Their descendants \u2013 mostly women \u2013 still form the backbone of the lowest levels of tea production. Dressed in frayed button-down shirts and thick long skirts to protect from leeches, they spend their lives picking the finest leaves from the bushes. I see them walking up and down the tea estates, their hands nimble with years of practice, their necks bent with the load of the bamboo baskets tied to their heads, into which they carefully toss the leaves.\nThe best of 2025\nSri Lanka was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good.\u00a0See the full list here.\nThe women beam in delight when I speak to them in Tamil. \"Tell me about India,\" third-generation tea picker Sathyavathy demands, when I stop to chat with her group during their mid-morning tea break in the Bogawantalawa area, known as the \"Golden Valley\" due to its fine quality of tea. \"Is it beautiful?\" Like many of her peers, she has distant family back in the small towns of Tamil Nadu in South India but has never visited the country.\nMy initial hikes take me through stages seven and eight near Hatton in the heart of the tea country, dotted with old factories that still process tea using dated technology, and boutique hotels repurposed from massive bungalows once meant for estate managers. My guide here is Dharsharuban Rathnasingham, a young man whose grandparents and mother used to work in these very tea plantations.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 The rise of the slow swimming holiday\n\u2022\u00a0 A hike through history on Britain's oldest road\n\u2022\u00a0 Sri Lanka's most beautiful train journey\nRuban \u2013 as he likes being called \u2013 is passionate about sharing the stories of his people, Indian Tamils who populate the villages and towns around the various stages of the Pekoe Trail. As we walk, he stops to point out the elements distinctive to tea plantation life, like the \"line rooms\", cramped barrack-style quarters where large families lived together (and still do, in some places); and the statues of fierce Tamil protector deities placed at major crossroads or beneath trees, often depicted riding a horse or wielding a scythe.\nFrom Hatton, I take the famed Colombo to Badulla train to Ella, from where I attempt to tackle stages 15 and 16 over the next several days, taking in the viewpoint known as Ella Rock and the picturesque nine-arch railway bridge. Here, the tea goes in and out of view, with some stretches taking me over active railway tracks and others on paths shaded by tall eucalyptus and pine trees. The Pekoe Trail may be long and even tough in parts, but it is never boring or monotonous.\nAs Cruse says, \"There were just so many 'wow' moments during the hike, where you come around a corner, and the whole valley would just be laid out below and I would have to stop and just stare.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The Pulitzer Prize winning play was written in 1940 but not staged until after O'Neill's death in 1956.\nA semi-autobiographical work dedicated to his wife, O'Neill described it as \"play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.\"\n\"It has not been an easy project to get off the ground,\" Lange admits.\n\"This is a throwback to another kind of filmmaking and another kind of storytelling but in my mind this is the greatest American play ever written.\n\"It has this universality, this emotional depth. You'd be hard pressed not to relate to something in it, especially in the world we live in now.\"\nShe plays Mary Tyrone, the matriarch of an American family who's addicted to morphine since the birth of her sons, who struggles with loneliness and fears about her boys' health.\n\"Mary Tyrone is one of these parts which mean the world to me,\" says Lange.\n\"It may sound corny but I love her. It's thrilling as an actor to have a part like this.\"\nShe's played the role twice before on stage and it's the 2016 Broadway version, directed by Jonathan Kent, which has been brought to the screen. \nFilming wrapped in 2022 but it's only now that Lange and co-star Ed Harris have been able to premiere it in Dublin and Glasgow.\nShe arrived at the Glasgow Film Festival on Friday just as Tim Roth, who appeared in the opening film Tornado, departed.\nThe two actors were in the 1995 film Rob Roy, she as Mary McGregor, wife of Liam Neeson's Rob Roy, and he as the villainous Archibald Cunningham.\nAnd while Roth's abiding memories were of his war with the Highland midgie, Lange recalls a much more pleasant experience.\n\"It was such a marvellous time, up in the Highlands where I'd never spent time before and it was extraordinarily beautiful,\" she says.\n\"I had the whole family here and the kids had a whole life of their own going on.\n\"It was a very special time and I liked the film. Some locations and some projects you think, 'oh Christ why did I bother doing that?' and others you think 'that was something very special'.\"\nHer next projects will also focus on women. She's set to star in the film adaptation of Joan Didion's 2005 memoir The Year of Magical Thinking.\nAnd she's also keen to explore an extraordinary chapter in the life of the German actress Marlene Dietrich.\nIt focuses on the period when she moved to America and took US citizenship and the programme will reunite her with Feud and American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy.\n\"At a certain age in the eyes of Hollywood you are finished,\" says Lange.\n\"We touched on this in Feud about Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. This was the time in Dietrich's life, when she segued into this weird Las Vegas act and the story is about her meeting a young composer who helps her launch a whole new career as a performer.\"\nThat composer was Burt Bacharach and for five years their unlikely partnership revived her career.\n\"It's an interesting period,\" says Lange.\n\"It's also the time she goes back to Germany for the first time after the war, and takes her up to those years when she was living as a complete recluse in Paris.\"\nShe hopes the project will be up and running before the end of the year.\nHollywood may have a reputation for writing off its older women, but Jessica Lange, at 75, is still fighting their corner.",

        "article_text": "YouTuber Asmita Patel's mission was to \"make India trade\".\nThe wildly popular financial influencer called herself the \"She-Wolf of the stock market\" - her take on the Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street. At last count, she had clocked upwards of half a million subscribers on YouTube and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. Fees for her stock trading courses ran into thousands of rupees.\nLast month, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) put a spanner in the works. It barred her and six others from trading, alleging she was selling illegal stock tips disguised as investor education and making millions of rupees in the bargain.\nThe regulator's crackdown on Patel is its latest attempt to tighten the noose around social media influencers offering quick money schemes and trading advice disguised as education.\nIndia's post-pandemic market boom attracted a wave of new mom-and-pop investors. Online trading accounts grew from merely 36 million in 2019 to more than 150 million last year, data from the brokerage Zerodha shows.\nMany of these first-time market entrants relied on social media for trading tips which, in turn, birthed a new breed of self-styled \"investment gurus\" or \"financial influencers\" like Ms Patel, promising quick money.\nWith only 950 registered investment advisors and 1,400 financial advisors in the country, these influencers quickly filled the void, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers and followers.\nMost operated without regulatory registration, blurring the line between investment advice and stock market education. This prompted Sebi to crack down, banning at least a dozen influencers, including a Bollywood actor, from offering trading advice.\nThe regulator has also barred brokerages and market players from partnering with influencers who peddle illegal stock tips or make misleading return claims.\nSebi has also laid down strict guidelines for educators, effectively barring them from offering real-time trading tips or using live market data for educational purposes.\nThe regulator found Ms Patel and her husband, Jitesh, directing students and investors to trade specific stocks through their advisory firm. She allegedly used private Telegram channels, Zoom calls and courses to sell tips without mandatory registration.\nSebi acted in Ms Patel's case after 42 participants complained of trading losses and demanded compensation. It is now moving to seize millions of rupees that Patel and her associates earned from course fees between 2021 and 2024.\nAs markets correct, the economy slows and regulators crack down, other influencers face a credibility test.\nThousands of angry investors have recently accused high-profile influencers of faking their success to sell trading courses and earn millions in brokerage referrals. \nSebi's order in Ms Patel's case too revealed she made just over $13,700 (\u00a310,800) as trading profits in the past five years but earned more than $11.4m (\u00a39m) by selling courses.\nMs Patel didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nWhile Sebi's drive to protect small investors is well intentioned, its recent regulatory actions have drawn criticism for being delayed and lacking clarity.\nThe regulator has been both a \"selective\" and \"reluctant regulator\", Sucheta Dalal,  veteran financial journalist and author, told the BBC.\n\"It should have acted a few years ago when trading sites started paying influencers to promote their products. Now this phenomenon has become too big.\"\nSumit Agrawal, a former officer with Sebi, says the regulator singled out a few as an example instead of enforcing a clear, comprehensive policy.\n\"Curbing unregulated stock tips is necessary, but requiring trading schools to use three-month-old data for educational purposes and not teaching practical experience of trading strategies on live market crosses into over-regulation,\" he says.\nManish Singh, a chartered accountant and YouTuber with half a million followers, makes market analysis videos. He says Sebi's new rules have created confusion over what's allowed.\n\"Even genuine content creators who are trying to guide people in the right direction will lose subscribers and the monetary incentive of brand deals as confidence to work with creators is shaken,\" Singh told the BBC.\nBalancing this will be tough for the regulator, says Mr Agrawal. \nTechnology is inherently disruptive and the law is always \"playing catch-up\". Sebi's real challenge, he adds, is to monitor online content effectively without over-regulating. Notably, the Indian regulator wields broader powers than its counterparts in advanced markets like the US.\n\"It has extensive authority, including search and seizure powers and the ability to ban trading and freeze bank accounts without requiring a court order,\" says Mr Agrawal. \nA Reuters report, citing sources, says the regulator has again sought greater powers - its second request in two years - to access call records and social media chats in investigations into influencer-led market violations. \nThe challenge, say experts, will be to ensure it doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.",

It is now moving to seize millions of rupees that Patel and her associates earned from course fees between 2021 and 2024.The regulator acted in Patel's case after 42 participants complained of trading lossesAs markets correct, the economy slows and regulators crack down, other influencers face a credibility test.Thousands of angry investors have recently accused high-profile influencers of faking their success to sell trading courses and earn millions in brokerage referrals. Fees for her stock trading courses ran into thousands of rupees.Last month, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) put a spanner in the works.",

Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "In one of the most exciting and dramatic awards seasons ever, the field is wide open in several fields. BBC film critics give their expert predictions for the major Academy Awards categories.\nCaryn James: It has been a fun awards season, watching the nominees for best picture pinball around. Anora became the early favourite as the brash young voice of the future, until the bonkers Emilia P\u00e9rez became the Oscar darling for a minute, then Conclave had its moment as the smart mainstream choice, until The Brutalist announced itself as the epic with artistic ambitions until... full circle, Anora is the frontrunner again. It says a lot about the strength and variety of films this year that such mayhem could happen at all. Anora \u2013 funny, original and a little bit heartbreaking \u2013 is the likely winner. And among the realistic choices (six of the nominees might as well be category filler, and Karla So\u00edia Gasc\u00f3n's unearthed offensive tweets shattered Emilia's chances), Anora should win. But lurking in the background is Conclave, which could win by consensus, given that voters rank their choices in this category. Simplistic scenario: votes for the top film are so scattered that Conclave finally gets the most votes because it's everybody's second choice. Plus, it really is a satisfying political thriller that happens to be set in the Vatican, and its Bafta and SAG awards are a sign of real support. In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.\nNicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. This year, things aren't so simple. What we can say, judging by all the other awards ceremonies that have been and gone this year, is that Dune: Part Two, Emilia P\u00e9rez, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance and Wicked are vanishingly unlikely to take home the biggest prize of the night. None of them has whipped up the enthusiasm that's required from both the public and the critics. That leaves us with Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Conclave \u2013 and over the last few weeks I've wavered between all four of them as the most likely best picture winner. As I write, Anora seems to be the favourite, and I can understand why. It's a film about contemporary American life made by an American auteur, and it balances uncompromising grittiness with exuberant, crowd-pleasing flair. In a year when arguments could be made for and against so many contenders, Anora has come to feel like the choice that could please everyone, so it may well complete the journey it began when it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0This is a strong category, but I doubt that the Academy's voters will go for a French director who was largely unknown in the US before she made\u00a0The Substance, so Coralie Fargeat is out. The various Emilia P\u00e9rez backlashes have hurt Jacques Audiard's chances, and A Complete Unknown hasn't received much praise for its directing as such, so James Mangold is a long shot, too. That means that the best director Oscar will either go to Sean Baker, for the verve and naturalism he brings to Anora, or to Brady Corbet, for the valiant artistic vision of The Brutalist. But the amiable Baker has made several excellent films that haven't garnered many awards, including Tangerine and The Florida Project, so I suspect that he will be the Academy's choice.\nCaryn James: This race comes down to a stark contrast, between Sean Baker, whose Anora is a beautifully orchestrated contemporary romp, and Brady Corbet, whose The Brutalist wilfully announces its ambition as the kind of film they don't make anymore, an historical epic complete with intermission. It's a good guess that Baker is likely to triumph, because he won the Directors Guild Award and the film won the Producers Guild award, two major predictors of the Oscars. And he should win. He made Anora feel effortless, but beneath that apparent ease is some masterful work, as he navigates the changes in tone \u2013 from fairy tale to screwball comedy to drama \u2013 that make the film so rich. Coralie Fargeat deserves her place here for her confident direction of The Substance, but it's really a two-man race.\nCaryn James: Adrian Brody was on his way to making this a done deal, having won every major precursor from the Golden Globe to the Bafta, until Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet got in his way by winning the SAG award for A Complete Unknown. Oscar voting had ended by the time Chalamet won, but as an indicator of how the votes go, SAG has a great track record. You can never underestimate Oscar voters' affection for a biopic, and Chalamet's take on Bob Dylan was a true embodiment of a character as well as a spot-on impersonation. But Brody is still very likely to win, and he should, for his searing performance as a Holocaust refugee. He creates a portrait of a man who is talented and ambitious, sometimes ruthless and sometimes vulnerable, and fully human. But let's acknowledge how strong the category is this year, the rare case where it would be perfectly appropriate for Ralph Fiennes, Colman Domingo or Sebastian Stan to win too.\nNicholas Barber: Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) are neck and neck, so it's tricky to say which attributes will tempt the Academy more. Will it be pain, anguish and a Hungarian accent, or a nifty impersonation elevated by some expert singing and guitar-picking? Will it be the long-awaited return to greatness of a Hollywood stalwart who has already won an Oscar, or the crowning of a fresh-faced youngster who has nonetheless amassed a tremendous body of work? It could go either way, but Chalamet's Oscar campaigning has been flawless \u2013 he has shown himself to be fun-loving and self-mocking, but at recent awards ceremonies, including Sunday's SAG Awards, he has emphasised how seriously he takes a difficult job \u2013 so I'm betting on him. My own personal favourite is the wonderfully versatile Ralph Fiennes, who is so quiet and reserved yet so racked by doubt in Conclave \u2013 but I doubt that this is his year.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here. Both Moore and Torres won Golden Globes for their roles, in a musical / comedy and in a drama respectively, and for most of the time since then, they've been the frontrunners. Madison shook things up when she won the Bafta, so it's now the closest of calls. But I reckon that Moore will win. Partly, that's because of her savagely self-parodying performance as a former A-list star being turned into a monster by the ageist entertainment industry. And partly it's because her comeback narrative, as spelt out in her Golden Globes acceptance speech, would furnish the Academy with the kind of feelgood story it loves so much.\nCaryn James: Demi Moore has been on an almost steady march toward her first Oscar, marred only by Mikey Madison's Bafta, ever since her pitch-perfect campaign/acceptance speech on winning the Golden Globe for The Substance. Moore checks all the boxes: the story of how Hollywood finally takes her seriously, the insider status and the no-holds-barred performance in a film with a resonant message. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win. Torres gives a beautifully nuanced, restrained performance in\u00a0I'm Still Here\u00a0as a grieving yet determined widow during Brazil's political dictatorship. But Oscars tend to go to screaming, yelling, tearing-down-the-scenery roles, which is what The Substance and Anora call for. A brilliantly subtle performance like Torres's has an uphill battle.\nCaryn James: There's a reason Kieran Culkin has won every major award in this category in the run-up to the Oscars: he really deserves to. His wilfully outrageous, sad and moving character of Benji in A Real Pain may have echoes of his role as Roman Roy in Succession, but it is also funny and affecting on its own, a delicate mix of comedy and tragedy. And it hasn't hurt his chances that every acceptance speech of his is wry, self-deprecating and fun to watch. Some winners make an earnest point of saying \"There is no winner\" or spreading the praise around, but Culkin has turned acceptances into a stand-up art form. In another year, Edward Norton might have taken the award for his sharply drawn performance as Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, but that seems like a very unlikely upset.\nNicholas Barber: This year's Oscars are harder to predict than usual, but the best supporting actor category is the exception that proves the rule. Ever since Kieran Culkin won the Golden Globe for his role in A Real Pain in January, he has kept on winning and winning \u2013 and now it feels as if there is no point in any of his competitors turning up to the ceremony at all. Even those of us who would argue that Culkin isn't really a supporting actor in the film, but a co-lead with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg, have had to accept the inevitable. The only regrettable part of the whole business is that this category is stacked with Oscar-worthy performances, namely Yura Borisov's soft-hearted Russian muscle in Anora, Edward Norton's gentle Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce's bluff tycoon in The Brutalist, and Culkin's old Succession co-star Jeremy Strong as controversial lawyer Roy Cohn in The Apprentice. If they hadn't been up against Culkin, any one of them might have won.\nNicholas Barber: For a while it looked as if Zoe Salda\u00f1a had this Oscar in the bag. Of course,\u00a0she isn't really a supporting actress\u00a0in Emilia P\u00e9rez, but one of the leads. As soon as voters put her in this category, though, it seemed to be hers for the taking. Not only does she deliver a fabulous performance that includes energetic song-and-dance numbers, but she is a mainstay of the Marvel and Star Trek cinematic universes, so she has helped Hollywood make zillions of dollars. Then a journalist uncovered Those Social Media Posts. The bigoted remarks made by the other star of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, stripped the film of much of its goodwill, and Salda\u00f1a's hopes were badly damaged in the explosion of recriminations. Oscars observers started wondering: Would Ariana Grande win for Wicked, instead? It's still possible, but Saldana has distanced herself smartly from the scandal, and made emotional speeches at other award ceremonies, including the Baftas and the SAG Awards, so the Academy will probably reward her for her work, rather than punish her for her co-star's opinions.\nCaryn James: Zoe Salda\u00f1a may be the one person to escape unscathed from the Emilia P\u00e9rez debacle, and get the Oscar, as she should. She has won every precursor award, and is actually the dynamic centre of the story. Rita, the lawyer who helps the title character to transition and create a new identity, gives Salda\u00f1a her richest role yet and she makes the most of it. Rita starts as a fiery, beleaguered small-town lawyer, wrestles with her conscience about being involved with a criminal, and eventually becomes a philanthropist, and Salda\u00f1a sings and dances her way through it all with grace and presence. And she had the perfectly crafted answer when first asked about her co-star's offensive tweets, saying she was \"saddened\". Very well played. Isabella Rossellini makes a huge impact as Sister Agnes in a small role in Conclave, and Monica Barbaro is amazing as she channels Joan Baez in A Complete Unknown, but they can't complete with Salda\u00f1a's Rita.\nCaryn James: Peter Straughan is sure to win for Conclave. He turns Robert Harris's potboiler novel into a sleek, thoughtful screenplay, which is a huge part of what makes the film \u2013 pretty talky when you think about it, and not exactly an action movie \u2013 so suspenseful and entertaining. Turning that straightforward novel into a faithful screenplay may sound simple, but in fact Straughn's adaptation has a magician's deft touch, taking the best of the story and making it much better. It's great to see that RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes's screenplay for Ross's Nickel Boys is nominated. It's a dazzling adaptation of Colson Whitehead's extremely literary novel, but the film hasn't received the kind of major awards traction it would need to compete. The rest of the category is fairly weak. The screenplay is the least of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Sing Sing is less about script than performance. And the banal screenplay for the biopic A Complete Unknown shouldn't even have a place in this conversation.\nNicholas Barber: Peter Straughan's gripping adaptation of Robert Harris's novel, Conclave, has picked up prizes at the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice awards, and the Baftas. And when Conclave won best picture at the Baftas, the film's director, Edward Berger, made a point of singing Straughan's praises. Is he unbeatable at this stage? The controversies swirling around Emilia P\u00e9rez may have put it out of the running \u2013 as adventurous as Jacques Audiard's screenplay is \u2013 and there doesn't seem to be much chatter about A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys and Sing Sing in this category. So, yes, unless there are some Conclave-style shenanigans going on behind closed doors, Straughan should triumph here.\nNicholas Barber: This is one of this year's toughest categories to predict. September 5 hasn't built any momentum over awards season, but the other four best screenplay nominees \u2013 Anora, The Brutalist, A Real Pain, The Substance \u2013 are all brilliant in their own distinctive ways, and were all written or co-written by the films' directors. Sean Baker's Anora script won at the WGA Awards; Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold's The Brutalist was given the prize by two US critics' organisations; Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain won at the Baftas, and Coralie Fargeat's The Substance won at Cannes last year. My own preference, in a year of extremely long films, is Eisenberg's precision-engineered screenplay for A Real Pain, because it doesn't waste a scene, or a syllable of dialogue, in a trim 90 minutes. But I think that Anora will beat it, which would be OK by me, too.\nCaryn James: This is one of the richest categories, with three very different, thoroughly deserving nominees. Sean Baker's Anora is fresh and bold. Coralie Fargeat's The Substance is audacious and zeitgeisty. And Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain is perceptive and humane to its core. Anora and The Substance were also nominated for best picture, a sign of strength that might give them an edge. But I'm guessing that A Real Pain, which should win, will come through in the end. Where Anora and especially The Substance owe a lot to those films' initial concepts, Eisenberg's screenplay is the work of a writer with an ear for making his dialogue both believable and affecting. Of course, Anora is coming on so strong in other categories, you can't possibly rule it out, but if voters want to spread the awards around they may see this as a chance to give A Real Pain some well-earned recognition.\u00a0\nCaryn James: Once, this race seemed down to Emilia P\u00e9rez v I'm Still Here, but Emilia's implosion clears the way for I'm Still Here, which will win now and always should have. Walter Salles's brilliantly moving story of a family dealing with the aftermath of their father's disappearance during the Brazilian dictatorship in the 1970s is an eloquent, timely masterpiece that reveals the personal cost of politics. The film is nominated for best picture, which it surely won't win, and Fernanda Torres for actress, where winning would be an upset, but those nominations are a sign of strength that will translate into winning the International prize. There isn't a weak film in this category, with The Seed of the Sacred Fig another standout, but I'm Still Here towers above the others. There were celebrations in Brazil at the nominations alone, and although Brazilian films have been nominated before, including Salles's 1998 Central Station, it looks like the celebrations will go on for the country's first Oscar in this category.\nNicholas Barber: A storm of bad publicity knocked Emilia P\u00e9rez off-course this awards season, and suddenly it seemed as if one of its competitors might grab the Oscar for best international film. The most likely of these would be I'm Still Here, a powerful and popular Brazilian political drama whose star, Fernanda Torres, has been nominated for best actress. Also in with a chance are Flow, a Latvian cartoon which is nominated for best animated feature film, and The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which was made in secret in Iran by Mohammad Rasoulof, and then smuggled out of the country. But a week is a long time in awards season, and the Oscars take place a whole month after Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's offensive tweets were unearthed. My hunch is that the storm is passing, and that Emilia P\u00e9rez, which won the equivalent prize at the Baftas, will get its Oscar, after all.\nNicholas Barber: Nineteen years ago, Nick Park (and his co-director) won the Oscar for Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Nine years ago, the Oscar went to Pixar's Inside Out. Follow-ups to both films are nominated this year, and as this is one category in which voters aren't averse to handing prizes to sequels, either of them could win. Things are looking especially promising for Aardman's claymation caper, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, a favourite of mine which nabbed not one but two Baftas \u2013 one for animated feature film and one for children's / family film. The dialogue-free Latvian charmer, Flow, has its cheerleaders, too, whereas Memoir of a Snail, an Australian stop-motion animation, is just too gloomy to get voters behind it. That leaves the nominee which I believe will win: The Wild Robot. It's a sci-fi epic, yet it has a big heart and loveable picture-book visuals. Besides, its writer-director, Chris Sanders, made Lilo & Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon, but has never won an Oscar. Surely his peers will want to rectify that this year?\nCaryn James: How important is box office? That may be the deciding factor in this race, which is between two eco-themed films: The Wild Robot, the frontrunner, and Flow, its only likely competition. Flow is a true original, a dialogue-free Latvian film about a cat who tries to survive a flood. The Wild Robot is a funny, heart-tugging story about an intelligent robot, voiced by Lupita Nyong'o, who grows a human heart after being stranded on an island full of animal creatures facing an environmental crisis of its own. The Wild Robot has starry voices, including Pedro Pascal as Fink the Fox and Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, and it has earned more than $300m. In itself that might not be enough to get the Oscar, but the combination of star power, a timely message and its popularity with audiences is likely to make it the winner. And it is charming, so fair enough. The attention to Flow so far might be its best reward.\nCaryn James: There are years when documentaries with urgent political messages become the undeniable frontrunners and inevitable winners, such as Navalny in 2023 and 20 Days in Mariupol last year. This is one of those years. The extraordinary No Other Land will win and it should. Its eye-opening first-hand look at a village in the West Bank from 2019 to 2023, when Israeli forces destroyed homes and displaced the villagers, makes the cost of the conflict visceral. The film's backstory is compelling: it was made by a team of Israelis and two Palestinians, whose personal stories shape the film. And it resonates with even more impact since the turmoil in the Middle East continues. The film has not found a US distributor despite earning awards from several festival and critics' groups. but it has done very well in self-distribution. A vote for it might even convince the Hollywood players who have the power to release it wider.\nNicholas Barber: The past two winners of the Oscar for best documentary feature were 20 Days in Mariupol, which celebrated the resilience of the Ukrainian people during the current war, and Navalny, which condemned Vladimir Putin's regime. That trend could well continue this year, at a time when those inter-related topics are more urgent than ever, with the prize going to Porcelain War. Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev's film offers an intense, citizen's-eye view of the conflict in Ukraine, and shows civilians being trained as combatants. What separates it from other such documentaries is that the main participants, Leontyev and his wife Anya Stasenko, are artists who sculpt and paint exquisitely patterned porcelain animals. The theme is the importance of storytelling and creativity as ways to resist oppression \u2013 and what could be more appealing to Hollywood's film-making community than that?\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0If voters feel that a film as lucrative as Wicked shouldn't go away empty-handed, then giving it the prize for best original score is one obvious way for them to show it some love. But my money is on Daniel Blumberg's awe-inspiring score for The Brutalist, which won the Bafta in the same category. One of the questions raised by Brady Corbet's film is how such a low-budget indie drama can seem so epic, and the music has a lot to do with it. It's big, bold and experimental, with strange ticking and clinking noises to establish the theme of construction, stately motifs to echo the characters' grand ambitions, and some symphonic bombast and wild jazz to convey the thrill of arriving in the US in the middle of the 20th Century. It's also deeply eerie at times, so you can expect it to be used on trailers for horror films and science-fiction sagas for years to come.\nCaryn James: It might seem like Emilia P\u00e9rez and Wicked have the edge, but the songs that pop out of these musicals have their own category. Here, the award for the background music is between Conclave's Volker Bertelmann, who won the Oscar for his music in\u00a0All Quiet on the Western Front\u00a0(like Conclave, directed by Edward Berger), or Daniel Blumberg, who won this year's Bafta for his score for The Brutalist. Both scores serve their films well. Bertelmann's classical style adds suspense to the Vatican thriller. But I'd give the edge to Blumberg, who should win for his evocative score that adds a touch of the contemporary to the film's post-World War Two setting. Sometimes jazz-infused, sometimes commanding, his score enhances the mood without thwacking viewers over the head.\nCaryn James: The film that should win wasn't even nominated. It's still a head-scratcher why Jomo Fray's eloquent, imaginative cinematography for Nickel Boys, which gracefully meshed with director RaMell Ross's first-person narrative, wasn't acknowledged, while the film got a best picture nod. But there are two very strong contenders among the nominees. The Brutalist, shot in old-style, widescreen, rarely used VistaVision, has epic sweep, and is full of clarity. And Nosferatu's cinematography is a beautiful mix of colour in its scenes of daily life, and darkness in the shadowy world of the vampire. Jarin Blaschke, who has worked on previous, stunning Robert Eggers's films, equals that work in Nosferatu and should win. But The Brutalist and Lol Crawley probably will, if only because the film has been so much in the awards conversation, while Nosferatu definitely hasn't.\nNicholas Barber: The fact that Nickel Boys didn't get onto the shortlist for its immersive first-person camerawork is one of the Oscars' most puzzling oversights this year, and it's a shame, too, that the stylish Conclave was ignored. Of the films that were nominated, Nosferatu boasts glorious mountain vistas and shadowy Victorian chambers, while The Brutalist has the geeky appeal of large-format VistaVision film stock. But I have a feeling that the Academy will honour Greig Fraser's stunning views of uncanny alien worlds in Dune: Part Two. After all, voters have to give at least something to bona-fide Hollywood blockbusters, and this would be a worthwhile way for them to do so.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

Platforms which collect UK children's user data must minimise the amount they gather and take extra care when processing it.\nThe ICO's investigations into Reddit and Imgur will focus on how the platforms check the ages of their users and their enforcement of age checks.\nOfcom said in October Reddit had overtaken X as the UK's fifth most popular platform.\nImgur, meanwhile, says on its website that it reaches more than 250 million people a month.   However, it does not state in which countries their users are based, so there is no figure for the number of people using it in the UK. \n\"I don't want to pre-judge how we might look at the Imgur and Reddit matters, but if there are age limits for accessing services, then the platforms have to enforce those in some ways,\" the Information Commissioner told the BBC. \n\"There are a number of different technologies and techniques that are available, I would say, and the degree of rigor, I think, depends in part upon the kinds of risks, the likelihood that children will be accessing those sites. \n\"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\"\nA Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\".\nImgur has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.\nThe investigations do not necessarily mean any of the three platforms have broken the law. \nBut companies which are found to have done so can be punished with enforcement notices and fines.\n\"We are patrolling, and there will be consequences for breaches of the law,\" said Mr Edwards.\nIt is not the first time TikTok has faced scrutiny from the ICO.

        "article_text": "In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die \u2013 the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.\nWith a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.\nStill, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.\n\"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,\" she said.\nLocal health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.\n\"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,\" he said.  \"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "Canada is expected to react forcefully and immediately to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on its products. \nTrump has said he going ahead with putting a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, starting on Tuesday. \nLast month Trump put on pause his plans to levy a 25% tariff on most Canadian imports, with \"energy resources\" only facing a 10% rate.\nNow that that pause has ended, and the US is now set to steeply tax goods from one of its top trading partners, a trade war seems almost certain.\nCanadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters later on Monday: \"Let's be clear, if Trump is imposing tariffs, we're ready.\" \nShe said Ottawa planned to impose retaliatory tariffs against US imports of C$155bn ($107bn; \u00a3 84bn), with the first tranche of $30bn ready immediately to be levied on everyday goods like pasta, clothing and perfume.\nTariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.\nEconomists suggest that such a move could have devastating immediate impacts on Canada's economy - while also leading to higher prices for Americans.\n\"I won't sugarcoat it - our nation could be facing difficult times in the coming days and weeks,\" Trudeau said in a televised address to Canadians.\nCanada had worked to avoid a trade war. It has pledged more than C$1bn ($690m; \u00a3560m) to boost security at its shared border with the US - a key point of contention for Trump, who appears to be using tariffs as a negotiating tactic.\nTrudeau has said in the past that all options for responding were on the table - here are four of them, and their possible impacts.\nCanada has already fought one tariff \"war\" with Trump.\nDuring his first term, the US president slapped 10% tariffs on Canadian aluminium products and 25% tariffs on Canadian steel, citing national security concerns.\nOttawa retaliated by imposing tariffs on select goods, which were chosen to send a political  message to Trump and his allies.\nIt put levies on Florida orange juice, and whiskey and bourbon from Tennessee and Kentucky - the latter being the home of then-Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell.\nBoth countries ended up agreeing to lift the tariffs a year later. \nSenior Canadian officials recently told local media that if Trump imposed tariffs again, the immediate response would likely be targeted. \nAccording to US government data, 17% of US exports go to Canada. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the US.\nCanada stands to suffer a larger economic blow in any trade war with the US and this stark imbalance is why targeted tariffs are often the first and safest approach, said Peter Clark, a lawyer who previously worked on trade policy issues in Canada's federal finance department. \nBy targeting select goods, Canada can hit the US without widely punishing its own citizens, as tariffs can immediately raise prices for consumers at home.\nThis approach is also why officials are pushing a \"Buy Canadian\" campaign as a way to lessen the impact of a potential retaliation.\nBut pundits argue that Trump is less politically vulnerable this time, given that he cannot run for a third term in the White House. \n\"You won't have the same impact as last time,\" said Julian Karaguesian, an economics lecturer at McGill University in Montreal and a former finance counsellor at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC.\nAnother move Canada made in its first tariff war with its neighbour was to apply dollar-for-dollar tariffs.\nIt slapped identical tariffs on US aluminium and steel, and ensured the total dollar value of the American goods it taxed equalled the US tariffs on Canadian exports. That came up to around C$16.6bn at the time.\nThis time, the possible use of dollar-for-dollar tariffs could be much larger, with Canada posting a list of $30bn of potential goods it would tax \"until the U.S. eliminates its tariffs against Canada\". The list is heavy on agricultural products, but also includes inedible items like dental floss and luggage.\nThat could be expanded to another C$110bn worth of goods.\nBut the more sweeping Trump's tariffs are, the more goods Canada could tax in response.\nNot all of Canada is on board with dollar-for-dollar tariffs. Scott Moe, leader of the mineral-rich province of Saskatchewan, has said that broad levies on US goods would \"rip this country apart\".\nMr Karaguesian said the promised US tariffs on Canadian goods could plunge the country into a recession. If Canada responded with dollar-for-dollar tariffs, it could lead to inflation.\nThis would result in \"stagflation,\" he said, referring to a combination of high unemployment and rising prices.\nMr Clark said that whatever decision Canada took, politics would likely be top of mind. Polls suggest a majority of Canadians support retaliation, and that many Canadian business leaders want targeted, dollar-for-dollar tariffs.\nCanadian politicians might be pushed to respond more forcefully if it means a boost in approval, Mr Clark said. \"We're talking about political decisions, which are not always rational.\"\nOne of the most valuable assets in Canada's arsenal is energy.\nNorth-eastern US states like Vermont, New York and Maine significantly rely on electricity sold to them by neighbouring Canadian provinces. British Columbia and Manitoba also supply energy to western and Midwestern regions of the US.\nAbout 30 states receive some of their electricity from Canada, according to Canadian government data.\nCanada is also the top supplier of crude oil to the US, making up 60% of total oil imports, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\nDoug Ford, Ontario's premier, has suggested that Canada cut off Americans' supply to pinch Americans at the petrol pump.\n\"The only thing that would really sting in the immediate to short-term is if energy prices went up, because Trump himself campaigned on bringing energy prices down very quickly,\" said Mr Karaguesian.\nBut the move would be contentious, especially with the oil-rich province of Alberta - which has refused to sign off on taxing its oil and gas exports, arguing that doing so would disproportionately hurt its economy.\nOther ideas have been floated.\nFord said that Ontario could pull American-made alcohol off shop shelves in the province, signalling a different approach in which different provincial premiers could define their own responses.\nAnother option is not retaliating - at least for now. For weeks, Canadian officials have been meeting their American counterparts in Washington DC in a bid to stave off any American tariffs in the first place.\nBut that seems unlikely, with Joly saying on Monday retaliatory tariffs would go into effect if the US imposed the 25% levies.\nCanada has also signalled that it could bring in a relief programme for businesses harmed by the possible tariffs, similar to those introduced during the Covid pandemic.\nSome argue, given the economic costs of retaliation, that Canada should instead focus on diversifying its trade relationships and increasing domestic production.\n\"We're a natural resource superpower,\" Mr Karaguesia said, adding that the country could use the tariffs as a push to harness that potential and sell its products elsewhere.",

We need effective leadership.\"\nIt heralds a potential political comeback in this year's election for the Democrat, who quit in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations and scrutiny of his handling of the Covid pandemic. \nAmerica's most populous city is in a state of political turmoil as current Mayor Eric Adams denies claims he struck a deal to help the Trump administration with migrant raids in exchange for dropping a federal corruption case against him. \nThe former governor joins an already crowded contest, which includes lawmakers, young newcomers and Mayor Adams himself, though it is Cuomo who has the most name recognition. \nThe three-term governor resigned after an investigation found he had sexually harassed 11 women, including state employees.\nThe state-led inquiry determined he had made sexual comments, inappropriately touched or groped the women and kissed them without consent.\nAt the time, President Joe Biden led calls from Democrats for the embattled Cuomo to step down, and state lawmakers raised the prospect of impeachment.\nWhen the governor left office, he denied harassing anyone, but said he wanted to \"deeply, deeply\" apologise to any women who might have been offended by his actions.\nCuomo's stunning downfall happened a year after he basked in the adulation of millions of Americans who had tuned in daily to his no-nonsense televised briefings on the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut a report in 2022 found that under his administration, the state hid at least 4,100 Covid-related nursing home deaths from the public.\nCuomo admitted to a \"delay\" in reporting, but denied allegations that his administration purposely misled New Yorkers.\nOpinion polling by New York media in recent weeks has projected that Cuomo would become frontrunner if he entered the mayoral race.\nDays before the campaign was launched, Cuomo received the surprise backing of congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents the Bronx.\n\"Andrew Cuomo has the competence to govern the city. He has the courage to stand up to extremist politics - both from the far left and far right,\" he told the New York Post.\n\"We don't need a Mr Nice Guy. We need a Mr Tough Guy.\"\nCuomo's supporters have also launched a political action committee called Fix the City, which states it aims to raise $15m (\u00a312m) for his campaign war chest.\nOne of Cuomo's former aides who accused him of sexual harassment told the New York Post on Saturday that she fears women's rights will suffer if he wins election.\n\"New York City may elect a mayor who has been rightfully accused of sexual misconduct by several young women who worked for him in up-close positions,\" said Karen Hinton.\n\"As a movement, we women haven't done enough to toughen laws to protect women from such immoral, unethical, and what should be illegal behaviour by men in positions of power, such as Cuomo.\"\nThe Democratic primary vote will take place in June. The eventual winner is expected to defeat any Republican challenger during November's election and become the city's next mayor.\nAdams has chosen to remain in the race, even while facing federal fraud, bribery and other charges. \nThe Trump administration is seeking to dismiss the charges, arguing that the charges have damaged the mayor's ability to aid the president's agenda and were politically motivated. \nThe attempt caused Manhattan's lead prosecutor and six other high-level federal prosecutors in New York to resign in protest, saying there was no legal justification for the White House directive to end the prosecution.\nMeanwhile, the judge in the case has cancelled the upcoming trial in April as he works to decide whether the case should be dropped or not. \nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul, who took over for Cuomo after he resigned, said last month that she was declining to use her authority to replace Adams, at least for now, and would instead move to limit his authority.\nAdams has denied making a \"quid pro quo\" with Trump's office to help in the removal of illegal migrants, last month calling the assertion \"silly\".\nAdams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. He denies the charges.\nHis office has been plagued by staff departures and scandals, even before charges were pressed against him. A number of figures in his orbit have also been indicted as part of the investigation.",

We had to run into a store screaming that somebody was going to kill us.\"\nValkyrae, who has 3.4m followers on Instagram, said she hopes it's a \"learning for other streamers\".\n\"It only takes one person, so be careful.\"\nPosting on X, she also said what happened demonstrates the \"harsh reality women live in\" and hit out at online comments that it was staged to drive hits.\n\"Seeing accounts accusing my friends and I for faking this and blaming us instead of questioning the man's behaviour has been embarrassing to see.\n\"I've learned it doesn't matter how much I accomplish in this industry or how much I try to gain respect, some men will hate women and blame women no matter the situation.\"\nEmiru did not appear in the follow-up stream on Monday but posted on X afterwards. \n\"I wish I could say this was some kind of one-in-a-million incident, but the truth is, it is not,\" she said. \"This is what life is like for girls.\n\"I hope if anything, people see what happened and realise how much of a reality it is for women and content creators as a whole.\"\nBBC Newsbeat has contacted Pacific Park for comment. \nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'It's all boiling over' - Cunha sees red for violent conduct\nAn FA Cup fifth-round defeat by Bournemouth was a disappointing blow for Wolves, but the impact of losing star forward Matheus Cunha for at least three Premier League matches may hurt even more.\nThe 25-year-old had to be dragged down the tunnel and was unable to take part in the penalty shootout following his red card in the final minute of extra time for an unsavoury clash with Cherries defender Milos Kerkez. \nWolves boss Vitor Pereira said: \"Of course, the emotional side was very high and not only inside the pitch, but on the bench and in the stands, a lot of pressure everywhere. In the end it happens.\n\"It should not happen, but this is something that happens in football.\"\nBoth Matt Doherty and Boubacar Traore missed spot-kicks for Wolves in the 5-4 shootout defeat after a 1-1 draw over 120 minutes at Vitality Stadium.\nIt was a dramatic climax to a game where Evanilson had put the Cherries ahead on his return from injury, before his fellow Brazilian Cunha levelled with a sensational equaliser from around 30 yards.\nHowever, Cunha's display went from magical to madness with a dismissal that will leave his side - fourth bottom in the Premier League - without their best player for crucial games in their relegation fight.\nThe red-mist moment, where he clashed multiple times with Kerkez, including fighting, kicking out at the Hungarian full-back while he was on the ground and aiming a headbutt when Kerkez had got back to his feet.\nAfter being pulled away by team-mates, referee Sam Barrott eventually gave him a red card but a furious Cunha refused to leave the field, needing to be escorted and pushed down the tunnel. \nHe will be suspended for three games following the red card for violent conduct, but additional games cannot be ruled out because of the severity of the incident and having already served a two-match ban for clashing with Ipswich Town security in December.\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on Match of the Day: \"The ability he has is top level, the goal he scored belongs in the Champions League, but then suddenly we see the ugly.\n\"I have not seen that on the football pitch since the 1970s - he just lost it. The referee had to send him off. They couldn't get him out of the ground. This was the ugly part and it is something he has to stop.\n\"Wolves need points to stay up. He will be a huge loss.\"\nCunha sent off as Bournemouth beat Wolves on penalties\nWhy did Bournemouth VAR check take eight minutes?\nWolves have what could be described as a favourable run of fixtures coming up against teams in the bottom half of the Premier League. \nBut Cunha is certain to miss matches against Everton, bottom club Southampton and West Ham, while third-bottom Ipswich follow on 5 April.\nWolves have built a five-point buffer over Ipswich and Leicester City after winning two of their past four league matches.\nBut losing talisman Cunha will be a massive blow, given he is their top league scorer on 13 goals and their attacking inspiration in this troubled campaign.\nCunha was sent off in the 120th minute of the match in the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Vitality Stadium\nCunha has been linked with a big-money move over the past year with Europe's top clubs keen, but he may be viewed as a loose cannon because of his antics.\nAs well as his aggressive display at Bournemouth, in an unsavoury incident at Ipswich earlier in the season, Cunha elbowed a member of the Portman Road staff before snatching his glasses off his face.\nThe Brazil forward is known to have a \u00a362.5m release clause in place which may also put off suitors looking to secure a summer transfer.\nWolves boss Pereira told BBC Match of the Day: \"When the situation happened I was looking for the ball.\n\"It means that I didn't see the situation, but football is emotional and the level was very high today. Not only inside the pitch, but outside [the pitch]. With a lot of pressure, and in the end these are things that can happen.\n\"You know now he is frustrated, he is better in my opinion. I never speak to the team when we are nervous or frustrated. It is better to wait one day and think about everything. After we can have a talk.\n\"Of course, he is an important player, but next game we play with 11 and start with 11.\"\nSpeaking in his post-match news conference, he added: \"Matheus is a special player and today he played extra time. The last three weeks he has a problem in the hamstring and he tried.\n\"I didn't see the situation. Don't ask me about it because I was looking at the other end. In the end the referee decided the red card.\"\nAsked about whether Cunha deserves another chance, Pereira added: \"Of course, he is important but I cannot speak about what I don't know. It is important to check the situation, to look for what happened because I was looking for the other side.\n\"The others say to me he kick, he punch, he do what he did with the head and the player went to hospital? No, OK. But it is a situation that cannot happen of course.\n\"To judge the situation, I must have the clear image in my mind.\"\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola criticised the decision to show Kerkez a yellow card in the Cunha clash. It was was the defender's second in this season's FA Cup and means he will be banned from playing in the quarter-final tie.\n\"Milos Kerkez has received a yellow card for adopting an aggressive attitude,\" said Iraola. \"After what they have done to Milos Kerkez, they should reward him because [of] the attitude he has.\n\"They punch him, they kick him on the floor, they headbutt him and he doesn't react! You punish this? I will have to say to Milos [that] probably I cannot do as well as a player.\n\"The prize is they show him a yellow card and he will not play the quarter-final.

But it is a situation that cannot happen of course. Wolves boss Vitor Pereira said: \"Of course, the emotional side was very high and not only inside the pitch, but on the bench and in the stands, a lot of pressure everywhere. In the end the referee decided the red card. \"It means that I didn't see the situation, but football is emotional and the level was very high today.",

        "article_text": "Sir Keir Starmer has told MPs that US President Donald Trump's commitment to achieving peace in Ukraine is \"sincere\".\nThe prime minister said Europe would have to do \"the heavy lifting\" as part of a peace deal but reiterated that a peacekeeping force would need \"strong US backing\". \nAs Sir Keir was speaking in the House of Commons, Trump posted on social media: \"Europe... stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the US \u2013 probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\"\nHe also accused Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky of not wanting peace adding: \"America will not put up with it for much longer.\"\nFollowing a summit of western leaders over the weekend, the UK and France said they would produce a plan to stop the fighting, which would then be discussed with the US.\nAddressing MPs, Sir Keir said Britain would \"play a leading role\" in any agreed deal including, if necessary, deploying British troops in Ukraine to deter Russia from further attacks. \nTrump has so far not agreed to provide any security guarantees and has instead focused on a deal to open up Ukrainian minerals to US companies.\nHe has argued that the presence of American workers in the country would help discourage Russia from trying to encroach on Ukraine territory.\nAsked by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage if the minerals deal would provide \"enough of a security guarantee\", Sir Keir said the deal \"is not enough on its own\". \nThe prime minister received widespread backing from MPs across different parties, with Conservative former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly saying he had \"not put a foot wrong\" over the weekend. \nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she backed the PM's decision to fund an increase in defence spending by cutting the aid budget and added that she would support him to make further \"difficult choices - including on welfare\". \nSpeaking about the deployment of British troops, the prime minister said he did not take any such move \"lightly\" and promised MPs a vote if that happened. \nHe argued that backing Ukraine was not only \"the right thing to do\" but was also in British interests.\n\"If we do not achieve a lasting peace then the instability and insecurity that hits living standards of working people in Britain, that will only get worse and Putin's appetite for conflict and chaos, that will only grow.\"\nHe later said \"success was not guaranteed but I am not going to let up\". \nRussia has flatly rejected the idea of western troops being sent to Ukraine as part of any peace deal.\nSunday's summit in London came after an explosive spat between Trump and Zelensky at the White House last week.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump was \"no longer a reliable ally with respect to Russia\" and that it was time the UK reviewed its dependency on the US. \n\"I don't agree with him,\" replied Sir Keir, adding: \"The US and UK have the closest of relationships - our defence, security and intelligence are completely intertwined.\n\"A huge mistake at a time like this would be to suggest any weakening of that link is the way forward.\"\nLabour MP - and chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee - Emily Thornberry questioned Sir Keir's decision to cut aid in order to bolster defence spending.\nShe said it was \"hard to believe\" there would be enough left in the budget to \"provide meaningful support\" and it could \"hobble\" the prime minister's attempt to show global leadership. \nAt the weekend, President Macron had suggested a partial, month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine, in which both would agree to a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure, but it would not cover ground fighting along the frontline in the east.\nEl\u00e9onore Caroit, a member of the French foreign affairs committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that President Macron's proposal sent a \"very strong message\" to Europe \"that if we want, we can do something\".\nBut Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC it was \"not a plan that we currently recognise\".\nHe added: \"Certainly there are a number of different options being discussed privately between the UK, France and our allies\u2026 What we are certainly doing is looking at what plan would bring peace as soon as we can, and what plan creates a lasting peace.\"\nThe prime minister hosted the London summit as allies scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.\nAt the summit, Sir Keir announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.\nThe plan involves including Ukraine in talks, continuing to supply it with military aid, boosting its defence capabilities and building a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend a deal to end the fighting.\nThe UK and France are taking a leading role and have both committed to send soldiers to Ukraine, under the proposals.\nBut apart from increasing spending on defence, there appears to be no consensus on a plan to end the war among European leaders.\nDefence Secretary John Healey will visit the US later this week to move discussions forward.\nIn other developments over the weekend:",

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "I'm 48, use social media occasionally, and I'm not very tech-savvy. Until recently I'd never used Telegram.\nBut last year, after meeting the family of Ronan Kanda - the 16-year-old who was killed in a case of mistaken identity by two other teenagers who'd bought a sword and machete online - I decided to figure out how easy it was to buy a knife from social media.\nIt seemed like the children in the case were able to buy huge, deadly weapons with shocking ease.\nSo in spring 2024, I set up several social media accounts in the name of a fake 18-year-old man. He is a Londoner who is friends with a group of young men who carry knives. He thinks he needs one too, to protect himself, and he knows larger knives are more intimidating.\nI got myself a separate mobile so my new searches would not impact my usual browsing algorithms. I started searching for knives, liking and following accounts which offered content.\nThe groups contained images of young men posing with knives, videos of close-ups of the blades, and some had videos of knife fights. Very quickly my new social media accounts started showing me more similar content.\nA familiar pattern emerged. Knives were being advertised in posts on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, with sellers directing buyers in their bio to their Telegram channels - encrypted groups where videos, photos and prices of knives for sale were openly shared.\nWithin hours of starting my searches I found and joined my first Telegram group selling banned weapons. There were zombie knives, machetes, switchblades and swords.\nTwenty-two-inch machetes cost \u00a340 and 24-inch zombie knives were \u00a350 - with new stock arriving soon. The seller was based in Walsall and promised delivery to the Birmingham area for \u00a35. Days later, a message went up saying the machetes and zombie knives had sold out.\nThen a poll went up, asking \"Should I get stab-proof vests?\" Fifty-six subscribers answered. A few weeks later, stab vests were available to buy.\nWithin a few weeks I found more than 10 social media accounts offering illegal knives for sale. It didn't take long for me to learn the slang used for terms like knife seller, flick knife and zombie knife.\nKnives were offered in a range of colours - gold, silver, red and blue being the most common. Sellers uploaded photos of their parcels, naming the courier companies they were using to \"guarantee quick delivery\". In some groups buyers had written reviews after receiving their knives - \"banging quality these\" and \"vouched - nice one bro\".\nThere were deals too. One group offered discounts on bulk buying, \u00a35 off second orders, and the chance for members to win knives and knuckledusters for free. As far as I could see, none of the groups were doing any kind of age verification.\nSome were closed down during the nine months I observed them on Telegram, including one called Shanks R Us. But most of them stayed active the whole time.\nMany routinely posted that they were out of stock, and apologised for the inconvenience.\nIn September 2024, the government introduced legislation making it an imprisonable offence to own or sell zombie-style knives and machetes. This added them to a long list of prohibited knives.\nIt's clear they are now getting harder to get a hold of.\nIn one group, the admin says they are getting zombie knives manufactured and shipped from abroad - Malaysia, Pakistan and China - and it's taking longer than usual. The admin brags that \"all [their] shipments land\", and now they're focusing on \"bulk stock for the future\u2026 meaning the knives should be cheaper\".\nBut despite this, the trade is still going strong. On 14 February, I see a message on a group that's grown from zero to 600 members in just a few months reading: \"Happy Valentine's Day to da ladies out there, grab your mans a tool for Valentine's Day, make sure he's safe.\"\nMany of the knives being sold are clearly illegal - but some aren't.\nThe sale of legal knives over Telegram is not technically forbidden, as you don't need a licence or registration to sell them. It is, however, illegal to publish material encouraging the use of a knife as a weapon.\nIn spring 2025, the Home Office intends to launch a consultation into a registration scheme for selling knives online - which would require sellers of all knives, including regular kitchen knives, to sign up.\nThe Offensive Weapons Act states that there should be a system in place for age verification on sale and for delivery, but there's no evidence that this takes place in the social media groups I've been in.\nI contacted the social media platforms to ask what they were doing to curb this harmful content.\nSnapchat said selling weapons, including knives, was explicitly banned on the platform and that it actively worked to remove such content.  \nIt said action was taken against violators of the policy - like disabling accounts. It also said it supported police investigations and had a team working around the clock to respond to authorities' data requests.\nSimilarly, TikTok said the trade of dangerous weapons was prohibited and that in the third quarter of 2024, 96% of clips that breached guidelines were removed before being reported. It said sharp knives, regardless of size, were not allowed to be sold on TikTok Shop.\nIt added it worked closely with government and police to understand changes in knife crime, and assisted police enquiries.  \nI reached out to Meta too - which hasn't yet provided a comment. Previously a spokeswoman told the Times that the promotion and sale of weapons on Meta's platforms was banned, and that such content was removed when found.\nShe added that in 2024, Meta met other tech firms, the Home Office, Ofcom and officials to understand how to work together to tackle the issue.\nTelegram - the most unregulated of all the platforms - didn't get back to me.\nTelegram is crucial as it is the place where sales of the dangerous weapons actually take place - without action by them, things might not change even if Snapchat, TikTok and Meta cracked down on harmful content.\nMurdered teen Ronan Kanda's sister told the BBC that his murderer \"didn't have any problems collecting his knife from his local post office\".\nHis mother, Pooja, was adamant that the online sale of bladed articles had played a \"crucial role\" in the tragedy. \"A 16-year-old managed to get these weapons online and sold these weapons to other people,\" she said.\nFollowing his death the government has announced a series of new measures known as Ronan's Law, including stiffer sentences for selling knives to under-18s.\n\"Out of tragedy comes a light,\" said Pooja. \"The light we all need.\"\nBut she stressed \"there's so much more we can do.\"\nRight now, it's still incredibly easy to buy lethal blades on social media.",

I started searching for knives, liking and following accounts which offered content.The groups contained images of young men posing with knives, videos of close-ups of the blades, and some had videos of knife fights.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nJonas turned professional in 2017 and has won 16 fights, lost two and drawn one \nNatasha Jonas v Lauren Price\nVenue: Royal Albert Hall, London Date: Friday, 7 March\nCoverage: Follow live text commentary from 20:00 GMT and radio coverage from 21:00 on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds, BBC Sport website & app\nSetbacks lead to comebacks. Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie says the writer's block she experienced after becoming pregnant with her first child was \"terrifying\".\n\"It's a really frightening place to be, because writing is the thing that gives me meaning,\" the acclaimed Nigerian author, 47, tells the BBC's Emma Barnett.\n\"I'm not sure that it was just entirely physiological but something changed, and I just could not get back into that magical place where I can write fiction.\"\nAdichie had her first child, a daughter, in 2016. Last year, she had twin boys, now 11 months old.\nWhile she was pregnant, she had a \"very foggy feeling\" and \"couldn't think as clearly,\" she says.\n\"I'm a person for whom thinking clearly is so important, and so to be in that kind of place emotionally is very frightening,\" she says.\nAdichie is now releasing her first novel in more than a decade, Dream Count.\nThe book tells the story of four women navigating lives that aren't going to plan.\n\"I couldn't write for a while, and then I started writing again,\" she says.\nAdichie is known for work that explores themes including feminism, gender and immigration. The novelist's 2012 Ted Talk We Should All Be Feminists helped push her to greater prominence, and was even sampled by Beyonc\u00e9 on her 2013 song Flawless.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, she speaks about topics including parenthood, grief and artificial intelligence (AI).\nAdichie's beliefs about gender have led her to reflect on how she'd like to bring up her sons. \"I'm determined to raise good men,\" she says.\n\"I want to raise my boys to be emotionally comfortable, to be in touch with emotion, to not be afraid of emotion, and also to not be afraid of fear,\" she continues.\nCompared to girls, Adichie believes boys don't have many \"wholesome\" role models. \"This space is just occupied by noxious characters and ideas,\" she says.\nThe writer adds that she wants her sons to be \"the kind of boys that never start a fight but if you bring a fight to them, they will beat you up\".\nAs well as having her three children, since writing her last novel, Adichie has also lost both of her parents.\n\"Grief recedes but only in waves and then, at some point, it comes back,\" she says.\nAdichie was surprised by how physical grief felt. \"Your heart really is very heavy, you feel as though your body is somehow no longer able to carry the weight of your heart,\" she says.\nThe novelist says that grieving for her mother, who died suddenly on her father's birthday in 2021, had a role in shaping her new novel.\nWhen she started writing the book - after her mother died - \"I did not think I was writing about my mother,\" she says. But when she had nearly finished, she reread the manuscript and realised there was \"so much about mothers and daughters\" in it, even though she hadn't been conscious of this while writing.\n\"I felt very strongly that, in some ways, my mother had opened the door for me to get back into this magical place that means that I can write fiction,\" Adichie says. \"I kind of thought that she's comforting me, and it was actually deeply emotional for me to make that realisation.\"\nAs someone with a deep emotional connection to the creative process, it is perhaps unsurprising that when the conversation turns to AI, Adichie has a strong stance.\nThe author says that we should not refer to any written content produced by generative AI produces as stories and that the technology is going to make all of us, if we embrace it widely, \"increasingly stupid\".\nShe argues that AI could limit human creativity, something she says \"we should never think that we can somehow replace\".\nEven using AI for tasks like summarising work emails can be damaging, she says. \n\"The ability to summarise is something that requires a certain level of creativity and imagination and intelligence, and it just seems to me that if you're ceding that to something else, what are we going to let our brains do for us?\"\nWatch the full interview on BBC iPlayer - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: The Interview with Emma Barnett",

        "article_text": "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.\nCharli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.\nUS star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.\nBut no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.\nListen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night. \nThe pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.\nReleased in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nIn the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nCritics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age. \nKnowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.\n\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.\n\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nTeddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.\nJade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all. \nAs well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.\nOver the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.\nJack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.\nAs ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.\n\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.\nLater, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".\n\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"\nSpeaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.\n\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.\n\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"\n\"I'm wearing shades because I mashed up my eye playing padel [ball],\" said Stormzy, as he accepted the prize for best rap/hip-hop artist.\n\"I've got a very sore eye. I've got a bruised cornea.\n\"My eye's sore under here, I'm not being a mad man with shades on inside.\"\nSabrina Carpenter pretended to pleasure a Beefeater. \nCharli XCX gave a speech in a see-through top, with no bra. \nOne of Jade Thirlwall's dancers mooned at the camera. \nDanny Dyer uttered one of the English language's most offensive swear words.\nI'd guess that ITV's responses to Ofcom are going to make an interesting read.\nWord of the censor's concerns even filtered through to the arena during the show, much to Charli's annoyance.\n\"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said from the podium. I feel like we're in the era of free the nipple though, right?\"\nAs fans applauded, the singer grimaced: \"They put the clap track on, cool. Thanks for being on my side.\"\nThe Brits were set up in 1977 to celebrate the British Music Industry, and they are run by the BPI - an organisation funded by, and representing, the biggest record labels in the country.\nBut lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.\n\"Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments - because moments fade and careers take time,\" said Myles Smith. \"So please stick with artists past a viral hit.\"\nChappell Roan, who won best international artist, had a similar plea.\n\"I had to write a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones - and artists deserve that freedom, to explore horrible concepts, and to flop, and rise, and not be pressured into making music based off of what's trending.\"\nCharli XCX's multiple victories proved their point. Signed at the age of 14, she had to fight to make the music she wanted - after years of being told her songs were too abrasive and uncommercial.\n\"It feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven't made any sacrifices,\" she said.\n\"I've been doing my own thing in my own corner of the industry - and I guess, this time, culture caught up with us.\"\nMyles Smith has had an incredible 12 months. After giving up his job to pursue music, his feel-good pop anthem Stargazing went viral. So viral that it ended up as the best-selling British song of 2024.\nAsked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.\n\"And that said two things. One: This is like, the most irritating thing. But at the same time, I had made it to hold.\"\n\"Did you sing it for the operator when they picked up?\" we asked. \n\"No, I was passed to seven more people.\"\nSee? Being a pop star doesn't give you any shortcuts in the world of broadband service provider call centres.\nWhy did Jared Leto open his red carpet interview by trying to teach us an English accent?\nTo find out, you'd have to ask Jared Leto and, frankly, we're too scared.\nSabrina Carpenter was the night's biggest star - opening the show with a cheeky wink, a phalanx of Beefeaters and a vaudevillian mash-up of Espresso, Bed Chem and... er, Rule, Britannia.\nBut was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?\nThe prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).\nSix years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.\nTo be fair, the singer racked up an incredible 21 weeks at number one in the UK singles chart last year - more than anyone has ever achieved in a single calendar year - so her trophy wasn't entirely undeserved. \nA lot of viewers were left perplexed when Jack Whitehall sat down with Danny Dyer and what appeared to be his date: A woman with a horse for a face (we're not being unkind, see above for proof).\nWell, it turns out that Danny's neighbour was a German DJ who goes by the name of HorsegiirL and keeps their identity hidden behind a mask. Sort of like Deadmau5, but with fetlocks.\nMaybe next year she can come back to do a duet with Foals.\n \nEzra Collective made history by becoming the first jazz band to win the Brit Award for best group - beating previous title-holders like Coldplay, The Cure and Bring Me The Horizon.\nTaking to the stage, frontman Femi Koleoso had a few words to say about cuts to music education, and the lack of funding for youth clubs like Tomorrow's Warriors - where his band got their start.\n\"I'll bang this drum a bunch of times and I'll continue to do so until the entire country gets it\", he said.\n\"This moment right here is because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music.\n\"The reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK...  we're unsure of how to fix it, but the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies in giving a young person a saxophone.\n\"Because when you do that, you give them a dream, an aspiration and a goal.\"\nTo prove his point, he invited the London youth group Kinetika Bloco onto the stage of the O2, to blast through Ezra Collective's infectiously upbeat jazz anthem Shaking Body.\nThis year's Brit Award trophies, designed by Gabriel Moses, were cast in bronze... And they were heavy. \nWeighing 1.6kg each, you could break a toe if you dropped one. And Charli had to pick up four of the things for her winner's photo.\nIt took approximately six people to arrange them in her arms (\"don't push them between my boobs\", she squealed at one point) before she was ready for the flashbulbs.\n\"Is this lame?\" she asked at the last moment. \"It feels lame.\"\nThen she dropped them all and fell to the floor in a fit of giggles.",

He's got a point to prove, that's the beauty of this year.\n\"Anyone who plays well in the Six Nations has a chance to tour in the summer.\n\"There are a few boys in our squad who are in the mix and he's one of them.\"\nJones came in as a scrum consultant for the tournament after being given permission by his Harlequins club.\nThe Wales scrum impressed against Ireland with props Nicky Smith and WillGriff John given starts.\nJones says he was shocked Smith, who joined Leicester from Ospreys for the 2024-25 season, had not regularly been selected previously by Wales with Gareth Thomas consistently starting. \nSmith has made just five starts in the previous 50 Tests for Wales.\n\"I don't know why he wasn't picked, because I wasn't here, but I'm glad to have him here,\" said Jones.\n\"He's been good for us.

        "article_text": "A plane crash in South Korea last December left Park Geun-woo an orphan. The 22-year-old had barely found space to mourn his parents when he came across a torrent of online abuse, conspiracies and malicious jokes made about the victims.\nThe Jeju Air plane, which was returning from Bangkok, Thailand, crash-landed at Muan International Airport on 29 December and exploded after slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, killing 179 of the 181 people on board.\nPolice investigations have identified and apprehended eight people who have been accused of making derogatory and defamatory online posts. These included suggestions that families were \"thrilled\" to receive compensation from authorities, or that they were \"fake victims\" - to the extent that some felt compelled to prove they had lost their loved ones.\nAuthorities have taken down at least 427 such posts.\nBut this is not the first time that bereaved families in South Korea have found themselves the targets of online abuse. Speaking to the BBC, experts described a culture where economic struggles, financial envy and social issues such as toxic competitiveness are fuelling hate speech.\nFollowing Seoul's Halloween crowd crush in 2022, victims and bereaved families were similarly smeared. A man who lost his son in the incident had his photo doctored by hate groups - showing him laughing after receiving compensation. \nPeople whose loved ones died in the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 - a maritime disaster that saw 304 people killed, mostly schoolchildren - have also for years been the targets of hate speech. \nThe tragedy saw the government pay out an average of 420 million won ($292,840; \u00a3231,686) per victim - triggering comments that claimed this figure was unreasonably high. \n\"People who are living day by day feel the compensation is overrated and say the bereaved are getting 'unfair treatment' and that they are making a big deal when everyone's life is hard,\" Koo Jeong-woo, a sociology professor at Sungkyunkwan University, told news site The Korea Herald. \nIn later comments to the BBC, Prof Koo suggested that economic stress and a competitive job market - particularly in the wake of Covid - has left many people feeling socially isolated, exacerbating the issue of hate speech.\nMany South Koreans, he says, now \"view others not as their peers, but as adversaries\", pointing to a widespread culture of comparison in South Korea.\n\"We tend to compare a lot... if you put someone else down, it's easier to feel superior yourself,\" he told the BBC. \"That's why there's a bit of tendency in Korea to engage in hate speech or make derogatory remarks, aiming to diminish others to elevate oneself.\"\nMr Park says the families of the Jeju Air crash victims have been characterised as \"parasites squandering the nation's money\".\nBy way of example, he refers to a recent article about an emergency relief fund of three million won ($2,055; \u00a31,632) that was raised for the bereaved through donations. That article was met with a flood of malicious comments, many referencing the erroneous suggestion that taxpayers' money was used for the fund.\n\"It seems like the families of the Muan Airport victims have hit the jackpot. They must be secretly delighted,\" said one such comment. \nMr Park says these comments were \"overwhelming\".\n\"Even if compensation for the accident comes in, how could we possibly feel like recklessly spending it when it is the price of our loved ones' lives?\" he says. \"Every single one of those comments cuts us deeply. We're not here to make money.\"\n\"Too many people, instead of being sensitive, build their entertainment on others' suffering,\" he adds. \"When something like this happens, they belittle it and spew hateful remarks.\"\nJoshua Uyheng, a psychology professor in the Philippines who studies online hate,  says that hate is often \"directed towards [those] we believe are gaining some advantage at our expense\". \n\"We feel hatred when we [think we] are getting the short end of the stick.\"\nIn the case of the Jeju Air crash, political dynamics only made things worse.\nThe accident came amid a period of political turmoil in South Korea, with the country reeling from suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's shock decision to enact martial law - an incident that politically divided the country.\nMany supporters of President Yoon's right-wing People Power Party have, without evidence, pinned blame for the crash on the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), pointing to the fact that Muan Airport was originally built as part of a political pledge by the DP.\n\"The Muan airport tragedy is a man-made disaster caused by the DP,\" read one comment on YouTube. Another described it as \"100% the fault\" of the party.\nPark Han-shin, whose brother died in the plane crash, says he has been accused of being a DP member and \"fake bereaved family member\". So extensive were these claims that his daughter took to social media to call them out.\n\"It pains me deeply to see my father, who lost his brother in such a tragedy, being labelled a 'scammer'. It also makes me worried that this misinformation might lead my father to make wrong choices out of despair,\" she wrote on Threads two days after the incident.\nPark Han-shin says he is stunned by how people seem to \"enjoy taking advantage of others' pain\".\n\"That's simply not something a human being should do,\" he told the BBC. \n\"I am just an ordinary citizen. I am not here to enter politics. I came to find out the truth about my younger brother's death.\"\nWhile there are no perfect solutions to hate, experts say social media companies should establish policies on what constitutes hate speech and moderate content posted on their platforms accordingly.\n\"Online users should be able to report malicious posts and comments smoothly, and platform companies must actively delete such content,\" Prof Koo says. Law enforcement agencies should also take perpetrators to task, he adds.\nReminding people of their shared identities may also help, says Prof Uyheng.\n\"The less people feel that they are on opposite ends of a zero-sum game, perhaps the more they can feel that tragedies like these are the shared concern of us all - and that victims deserve empathy and compassion, not vitriol and condemnation.\"",

        "article_text": "The business of the North American Toy Fair, an annual showcase of the latest in silly putty, monster trucks and board games, is fun. But this year at the convention center in New York City, tariffs were killing the vibe.\nIn February, US President Donald Trump raised tariffs on products made in China by 10%. Then last week, with little warning, he announced an additional 10% border tax, which has now come into force on Tuesday, along with tariffs on Mexico and Canada. \nIn the toy industry, which estimates that about 80% of toys sold in the US are made in China, the rapid-fire announcements have stunned businesses, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to swallow a sudden 20% rise in cost.\nThe moves are the first of what Trump has threatened will be far wider action, making it a preview of the upheaval that could be coming for companies around the world.\n\"It's the first thing we talk about and the last thing we talk about,\" toymaker Jay Foreman said this weekend from his booth at the trade show, where classic hits such as Lincoln Logs, Tonka Trucks and K'Nex were on display.\nHis business, Basic Fun!, makes 90% of its products in China and had been planning to counter the cost of the initial 10% tariff with a mix of higher prices for customers and lower profits, both for his firm and for his manufacturing partners. \nHe presented the strategy to his board on Wednesday, ahead of the toy show, only to have to rip it up the next day, after Trump's later announcement. \nHe will have to shoulder the tariff costs for products headed to stores this spring, he said, but is now expecting to raise prices for many items by at least 10% later in the year. \n\"The reality is that tariffs will raise the cost of toys for consumers,\" he said. \"If a customer says, 'Then I can't buy it', then I can't sell it, because I can't produce to lose money.\"\nTariffs are a tax on imports collected by the government at the border and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods.\nDuring Trump's first term, China was the main target of the measures, with more than $360bn worth of products sent to the US getting hit by the measures.\nAt the time, toys and many other consumer products were spared.\nBut Trump has now applied the duties across the board, hitting almost 15% of the imports into the US each year.\nHis actions have been overshadowed by tariffs on products made in Mexico and Canada - America's top two trade partners, which have long operated under a free trade agreement with the US. \nAnd they fall short of the \"up to 60%\" tariff that Trump called for on the campaign trail last year. \nBut with the latest move, businesses say the costs are getting too big to ignore.\nThe average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, with recent actions amounting to a rise roughly twice as large as the increase during Trump's first four-year term as president, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.\n\"10% - it's something we can somehow live with. 20% is a different ball game,\" said Yaron Barlev, chief operating officer of Clixo, a Brooklyn-based maker of magnetic building toys which started about five years ago and signed a deal last year to start selling its toys at Target later in 2025.\nWith manufacturing in China now under way to satisfy that order, his firm, which employs 18 people in the US, is expecting to have to shoulder the costs of the border duties, scrambling its plans for profits.  \nHe said he hoped Trump would offer some kind of reprieve for toys but was not feeling especially optimistic.\n\"It's much less predictable now than he used to be so I really don't know.\"\nTrump has said his actions will help boost manufacturing in the US, by making it less cost-effective to make products overseas. \nBut toymakers like Clixo, which had hoped to do its manufacturing in the US, say high costs and limited manufacturing capacity in the US make that idea unrealistic.\nMeanwhile, a string of weaker economic data has raised concerns that the uncertainty due to the tariff talk is starting to cause wider economic paralysis. \nBasic Fun!, which employs about 165 people and does roughly $200m in sales each year, had been looking to grow. But with the threat of tariffs bearing down, Mr Foreman recently put plans for acquisitions on hold, unsure how to calculate what a business would be worth in such a changeable environment. \n\"[A tariff] sounds good - 'Let's stick it to them!' But the ripple effect is unbelievable,\" Mr Foreman said.\nThe Toy Association, a business lobby group, says it is trying to make the case to the White House and Congress that toys should be exempt from tariffs, as they were before, warning that higher prices won't go unnoticed by a public already upset by the jump in prices in recent years.  \nPresident Greg Ahearn said his members are largely small businesses with profit margins barely as large as the tariffs that are getting under way. \n\"We think we have a very strong point to make and we're hoping they're going to be open to listening,\" he said. \nThe Toy Fair is his organisation's marquee event, drawing businesses from around the world who line New York's convention center with cheerful displays of blocks, high-contrast baby books and spiky coloured balls. But worry about tariffs pulsed through the gathering this year.\n\"It's killing our mojo,\" said Mr Ahearn, noting that it was his members' top concern.  \nFrom their booths, toymakers greeted questions about Trump's moves with head shakes, grimaces and disbelief. \n\"20% is a lot,\" said Ada Luo, sales director for Wonderful Party, a manufacturer in Shenzhen, China, which makes Christmas light necklaces, leis and New Year's hats. \"10% maybe... between the supplier and the buyer we can share, but 20%? We don't have a clue.\"",

        "article_text": "The shocking blow-up between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Friday continues to ripple across the globe, including through American voters who expressed frustration at one or both leaders.\nThe extraordinary scene saw Vice-President JD Vance accuse the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" to the US, while Trump urged him to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\". \nTrump also accused the Ukrainian president of \"gambling with World War Three\" as Zelensky pushed back at suggestions that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin. Zelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early.\nWorld leaders and elected officials in the US have had much to say about the tense exchange, but so do American voters. We've asked five people what they think. \nThis South Carolina voter aligns himself with the Trump administration but he was frustrated by the Oval Office spat and wants the US to continue to back Ukraine. \nIt never should have happened. I blame both [Zelensky and Trump]. \nZelensky did come across as arrogant, frankly. I get he was trying to make his point but he doesn't know how to deal with Trump. [UK Prime Minister Keir] Starmer knows how to deal with Trump, [French Prime Minister Emmanuel] Macron knows how to deal with Trump, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin definitely knows how to deal with Trump, but [Zelensky] doesn't know how to handle Trump.\nSome of what Trump says is true. When he said Ukraine doesn't have the cards, [Zelensky] doesn't have the cards. \nBut Zelensky does have the cards in so far as saying that we will feel it in America shortly after Europe feels it, if Putin is appeased, because [Putin will] just reconstitute his forces and invade somebody else. \nThis Florida Democrat has repeatedly voted against Trump and said she was ashamed to call herself an American in the wake of the meeting. \nI had to pause it a couple of times to give myself a few moments to cool off. I saw Trump and Vance steamrolling President Zelensky and refusing to let him get a word in edgewise. \nThey were selfish, rude, callous, and displayed a complete lack of basic human empathy.\nIt's hard to stay optimistic about the outcome of this war, and I knew something like this was likely to happen after Trump was re-elected. \nI've been dreading this possibility since election day; however, I didn't anticipate Trump being this horrible about it. I'm terrified for Zelensky and Ukraine.\nIf more people had seen the full interaction between Trump and Zelensky, then this Pennsylvania voter says they would understand Trump's frustrations. \nThe majority of the American public is getting a sliver of what happened, I'm glad that was public but I wish people would watch the whole thing  because I think they'd have a very different point of view.\nThis war needs to end, but it's not going to end the way Zelensky wants it to end. It's a sad state of affairs.\nZelensky was expecting it to go a lot differently and I give Vance and Trump a lot of credit for handling it the way it did.\nPutin sitting there going, \"Damn, I better behave because Trump is holding no prisoners.\" \nThis New Jersey voter has backed both Republicans and Democrats in the past but was \"disgusted\" by how Trump and Vance handled themselves in the Oval Office. \nI was absolutely disgusted with it. Even if Zelensky and the Ukrainians were considered adversarial to us, you wouldn't talk to their head of state or head of government that way.\nI would go beyond sending more aid to Ukraine - I would go as far as saying we should send military assets: putting planes in the air or putting boots on the ground. \n[Putin] operates like a bully. The only way you're really going to get a bully to reconsider their actions is to stand up to them - you have to be willing to punch them in the mouth at some point in time. \nThis Indiana Trump voter wants to help Ukraine, but thinks there should be limit to US generosity to ensure Americans are taken care of too. \nI want to help them as much as we can but we can't keep giving, giving, giving.\nZelensky had good reason to want more, but I feel like he was in the wrong to ask for it in that manner. If he did it in private, it would have been the place for it.\nI didn't feel like Trump or Vance's reaction to it was wrong. It wasn't perfect, but I don't think it was a bad reaction per se. I hope there can be reconciliation after this, I want to help them end this war. \nBut if there isn't some middle ground they can find, I don't want to see the US to continue to spend and spend on a country that isn't ours when we have domestic problems.\nThis California voter was taken aback by the \"arrogant stance\" of Trump and Vance against Zelensky. \nAll it seemed like Trump and Vance wanted to do was \"make a deal\", in other words turn a profit from this conflict. Ukraine doesn't need trade partners. It needs allies, nations who aren't afraid to put some skin in this fight and fend off an invading enemy.\nThe world's leaders need to take in the full scope of this conflict and stop letting Vladimir Putin dictate the rules of engagement. \nThe war in Ukraine is not some limited regional border dispute. This is a case of full-blown invasion by one sovereign nation of another. \nThe war has gone on long enough for Ukraine to fight it without any other allies fighting alongside them in battle. Ukraine can't and shouldn't fight this war alone.\nThis Indiana voter supports the president but described Trump and Vance's behaviour as the wrong move. \nIn all my years alive, I've never seen anything like that before. I understand behind closed doors things like this happen, but the Oval Office is not where you're displaying your dirty laundry.\nI'm not a big fan of Zelensky but I found what happened in the Oval Office the other day is embarrassing.\nIt's getting muddled up between the personalities on display there but the fact of the matter is Russia invaded Ukraine not once but twice.\nRussia is the aggressor.\nI understand the administration wants to show the world what we're dealing with, but we're supposed to be the leader of the world and good leaders don't lose their cool at this level.\nI don't want to appear that I'm hostile of Trump, but I just think this style of leadership is not productive.",

        "article_text": "Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.\nLocated in Prince George's County, Maryland - one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US - the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.  \nAlthough it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with \"black excellence\", locals told the BBC.\nTo live there, Patricia Gafford says: \"You've got to have money \u2013 lots of it.\"\nThough Mrs Gafford is a dues-paying member of the private country club where she often plays golf, the 73-year-old says she does not live inside the gated community, because, as her husband once told her, \"'it's a little bit too rich for us'\".\nThe setting has also inspired a ground-breaking new soap opera called Beyond the Gates; its second week of programming begins on Monday. Beyond the Gates is the first new daytime soap opera on network TV in over two decades and the first hour-long daytime soap with a predominantly black cast on network TV.\nKristen Warner, an associate professor of performing and media arts at Cornell University, says seeing its release feels long overdue.\n\"Black folks have been huge supporters and viewers of soap operas since its inception,\" she told the BBC.\nYet with over 90 years of soap opera history, there has \"never\" been a black family as the main family from the start of the show, she explains.\nShe says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of \"elegance and glamour and style and fashion\", as well as the trademark \"messiness\" of the day-time plot lines.\nThe show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centres on the Dupree family. While its daily drama-filled plot lines are sure to be, in classic soap opera fashion, over-the-top, the setting was inspired by the very real exclusive enclave inside Prince George's County. \nThe long winding road that leads up to the Country Club at Woodmore is lined with big brick houses built like castles, and surrounded by expansive manicured lawns. A Maserati, Mercedes Benz or something similar decorates most driveways.\nThe depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.\n\"It was kind of like a culture shock for me to see black people with like these mega houses,\" Ms Balgar says. \nIn Woodmore, where census estimates say over 80% of the population is black, the average median household income is over $214,000 (\u00a3170,091). The average in the US is just over $80,000.\nMs Balgar too plays golf on Woodmore's course, where she occasionally hosts events for her women-of-colour centred social club, City Girls Golf. \nShe says Beyond the Gates has been \"all over social\" media and that \"everyone is excited\" about how it's putting a spotlight on a little-known hub of black affluence.\nLong before it was an axis for Washington DC's black elite, in the 1800s, Prince George's County was once known to house the most enslaved African Americans in all of Maryland, says Susan Pearl, a historian at Prince George's County Historical Society.\nOne of the largest plantations in the area, Pleasant Prospect, was located where Woodmore's gated community now stands. The street leading into Woodmore's gates carries the same name.\n\"Some of these wealthy, successful black families are living on land where hundreds of enslaved people were working for one large white property owner,\" says Ms Pearl.\nThe county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after \"a wave of violence\" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.\nBlack Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.\nThe area soon became known for its affluence.\nAt the time, the federal government, which employs many people in nearby Washington, DC, was one of the first to implement anti-discrimination policies, giving black Americans a rare chance at better opportunities and better pay.\nFederal jobs \"played a huge role\" in creating black economic success, Ms Davis says, leading to Prince George's County eventually becoming the wealthiest majority-black county in the US.\nBy the late 80s, \"McMansions\" owned by black families began popping up, she added.\nMeanwhile, the county's white population continued to decline as large numbers of white residents began leaving the District of Columbia area in a phenomenon called \"white flight\".\nYet it wasn't until 1992 that the Country Club at Woodmore admitted its first black member - nearly 70 years after the club first opened, in 1923. He died last year.\nThe history-making Beyond the Gates arrives at a \"strange time\", media professor Ms Warner says: \"The soap opera is nearly extinct.\"\nFor most of soap opera history, she explains, black characters were secondary to the story, introduced through the lives of white families, initially in roles like housekeeper, then later as cops and lawyers.\nNBC soap opera Generations made history in 1989 when it became the first to feature a black family from the beginning, but this will be the first soap to make a black family the star of the central plot.\nThe soap is also airing amid a backlash - spearheaded by President Donald Trump's administration - against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\nBeyond the Gates was born out of a collaboration between CBS and the NAACP in 2020, following the social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a gesture of \"goodwill\" that Ms Warner says is now being \"rolled back\".\n\"In the midst of everything being taken away, we have this one little moment where there is something there for us,\" Ms Warner says, referring to the soap.\nThe club's black members say that despite a shifting political climate, Woodmore - with its rolling hills and towering pine trees - remains a safe, familiar space. \n\"When I come onto the grounds, I see people who look like me,\" says Mrs Gafford, a member.\n\"It's great to come in and see Brent (Taliaferro) behind the counter,\" she adds, referencing the club's assistant golf pro, who is also black. \n\"We all feel like we're one big family - the Woodmore family,\" he agrees. \nThere are few people at Woodmore's club Mr Taliaferro doesn't know, including Hope Wiseman, who grew up inside the gates of Woodmore.\nShe believes the name of the new soap opera is aptly titled.\n\"Everybody wants to be behind the gates, so it's funny they called it Beyond the Gates. Everybody wants to see kind of what's back there,\" Ms Wiseman says.\nShe opened a cannabis dispensary down the road in 2018, making her the youngest black woman at the time to own one.\nIt's success stories like these and people like Ms Wisemen - black entrepreneurs and black dentists, like her mom - that aren't on TV screens enough, she says.\nThat's why Ms Wiseman says she is pleased to see this new soap opera depicting her community.\n\"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to grow up around and operate in an environment where there's black excellence all around you,\" she says.\n\"That's not the experience of most of black America. That's exciting to see on TV.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump said he would cut funding for universities that allow what he called \"illegal\" protests and prosecute and deport foreign students who participate. \nOn his Truth Social social media platform, Trump said that \"all federal funding will STOP\" for schools that permit students to protest illegally. \nTrump's announcement comes less than a year after massive student protests against Israel's war in Gaza swept across US college campuses, including Columbia University in New York and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \nAmerican students will be expelled, Trump said. \nTrump did not specify what would constitute an \"illegal\" protest. Broadly speaking, the right to protest is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution. \nThe Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, also known as Fire, swiftly condemned Trump's announcement. \n\"Colleges can and should respond to unlawful conduct, but the president does not have unilateral authority to revoke federal funds, even for colleges that allow 'illegal' protests,\" the statement said. \nThe group added that the move will \"cast an impermissible chill on student protests about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\". \nIn a separate announcement, the US Department of Education, General Services Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services said they would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of Columbia's federal contracts amid an ongoing investigation into compliance with Title VI, a federal law that bans discrimination based on ethnicity or ancestry. \nIn a statement, the education department said that it is considering stop work orders for $51.4m (\u00a340.19m) in contracts with the New York City-based university, and will review more than $5bn in grant commitments to the school. \n\"Americans have watched in horror for more than a year now, as Jewish students have been assaulted and harassed on elite university campuses - repeatedly overrun by antisemitic students and agitators,\" Trump's new Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, said in a statement. \nMcMahon added that \"unlawful encampments and demonstrations have completely paralysed day-to-day campus operations, depriving Jewish students of learning opportunities to which they are entitled\". \nIn January, Trump signed an executive order that called for the removal of foreign students who participated in protests. \nThe order also directed government departments to make recommendations that could allow educational institutions to \"monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff\" and, if warranted, remove them. \nA White House fact sheet on the order specified that it seeks to \"protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities\". \nIn April 2024, student protests against the war in Gaza drew national attention after students at Columbia were arrested at a student encampment set up on campus. \nThousands of arrests were ultimately made at dozens of universities across the country. \nAt Columbia, the university authorised New York Police Department officers to swarm the campus, a controversial decision that led to the arrests of about 100 students who were occupying a university building.\nFour months after protests rocked the campus, Columbia president Minouche Shafik resigned. \nEarlier this week, a federal task force announced it would visit 10 prominent US universities that have been the scene of anti-semitic incidents.

But he said he was not considering using military force - an assurance he has not given while stating his ambitions of taking the Panama Canal and Greenland.\nThe question of how to respond to Trump's tariff threats and other statements about Canadian sovereignty has dominated the debate in Trudeau's Liberal Party, with candidates vying to replace the PM after he announced his resignation in January. \nOn the other side of the Canadian political divide, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has also attacked Trump's statements.\nThe King has found himself at the centre of a recent whirlwind of diplomatic meetings following Trump's return to the presidency - some of which relate to the war in Ukraine.\nOn Sunday, he also met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who ended up in a row of his own with Trump at the White House on Friday. \nZelensky was in the UK to meet European leaders, who reiterated their support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia - with American support apparently on the wane under Trump.",

        "article_text": "Israel has blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza as it demands Hamas agree to a US plan for a ceasefire extension.\nThe first phase of a truce deal mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US expired on Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Hamas was refusing to accept a temporary extension proposed by Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.\nA Hamas spokesman said blocking supplies to Gaza was \"cheap blackmail\" and a \"coup\" on the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to intervene.\nThe ceasefire deal halted 15 months of fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military, allowing the release of 33 Israeli hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\nThe internationally-mediated ceasefire plan - originally proposed by Joe Biden - envisages three stages. \nThe first phase came into force on 19 January and expired on Saturday.\nNegotiations on phase two, meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, were due to have started weeks ago, but have barely begun.\nPhase three is meant to result in the return of all remaining bodies of dead hostages and the reconstruction of Gaza, which is expected to take years. \nHamas has previously said it will not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from the mediators that phase two would eventually take place.\nAs the first phase of the deal expired on Saturday, Netanyahu's office said Israel had agreed to Witkoff's proposal for the ceasefire to continue for about six weeks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Jewish Passover periods. \nIf, at the end of this period, negotiations reached a dead end, Israel would reserve the right to go back to war.\nWitkoff has not made his proposal public.

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "summary": "But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.Verstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.That would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.But there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.Verstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.But single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable.

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

        "article_text": "A magnitude 3.9 earthquake has hit Hollywood as some of the globe's top stars began celebrating after the Oscars. \nThe earthquake's epicentre was measured in North Hollywood, just miles from where the awards ceremony was hosted at the Dolby Theatre. \nThere were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The quake struck shortly after 22:00 local time as celebrities were gathering at the popular Vanity Fair afterparty. \nThose in the area reported a sudden jolt of energy, with some screaming and seeing high-rise buildings wobbling like jelly. \nThe US Geological Survey (USGS), which tracks such events, said the earthquake was felt miles across Los Angeles. \nThere was no tsunami alert issued as a result of the relatively minor earthquake.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department said that the earthquake was felt across downtown Los Angeles but the agency was not entering into \"Earthquake Mode\" over the incident. \nFor stronger earthquakes, first responders and officials do assessments of the area to ensure there is no structural damage to buildings and infrastructure. \nThe quake is among about 40 that have hit Southern California since the start of March - though nearly all of these were magnitude 1 earthquakes that aren't typically felt by residents, according to USGS data reviewed by the BBC. \nLast month, there was a magnitude 3.7 earthquake that struck the nearby Malibu area. In December, a strong magnitude 7 earthquake jolted northern California and caused a short tsunami alert for those in northern California and southern Oregon. \nBBC correspondents covering the Academy Awards in the heart of Hollywood reported fierce shaking and even some screams as the sudden jolt scared visitors. To some, it sounded like a bomb went off with the rumble. \nOne resident called it the biggest earthquake she'd felt and was surprised it was only a magnitude 3.9. \"I felt that in my bones,\" she remarked. \nThe BBC's Emma Vardy said she was retouching her makeup for some final Oscars filming when the quake struck. Her diamond earrings wobbled in the mirror and she realized the high-rise she was in was shaking.  \n\"I have felt a lot of quakes over the past two years in Los Angeles but currently, I am on the 15th floor of our media centre in Hollywood,\" she remarked. \"Feeling a building of that size move around like jelly is quite an experience.\" \nSam Granville and Emma Vardy contributed to this report.",

        "article_text": "In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die \u2013 the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.\nWith a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.\nStill, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.\n\"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,\" she said.\nLocal health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.\n\"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,\" he said.  \"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.\"",

The 22-year-old had barely found space to mourn his parents when he came across a torrent of online abuse, conspiracies and malicious jokes made about the victims.\nThe Jeju Air plane, which was returning from Bangkok, Thailand, crash-landed at Muan International Airport on 29 December and exploded after slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, killing 179 of the 181 people on board.\nPolice investigations have identified and apprehended eight people who have been accused of making derogatory and defamatory online posts. These included suggestions that families were \"thrilled\" to receive compensation from authorities, or that they were \"fake victims\" - to the extent that some felt compelled to prove they had lost their loved ones.\nAuthorities have taken down at least 427 such posts.\nBut this is not the first time that bereaved families in South Korea have found themselves the targets of online abuse. Speaking to the BBC, experts described a culture where economic struggles, financial envy and social issues such as toxic competitiveness are fuelling hate speech.\nFollowing Seoul's Halloween crowd crush in 2022, victims and bereaved families were similarly smeared. A man who lost his son in the incident had his photo doctored by hate groups - showing him laughing after receiving compensation. \nPeople whose loved ones died in the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 - a maritime disaster that saw 304 people killed, mostly schoolchildren - have also for years been the targets of hate speech. \nThe tragedy saw the government pay out an average of 420 million won ($292,840; \u00a3231,686) per victim - triggering comments that claimed this figure was unreasonably high. \n\"People who are living day by day feel the compensation is overrated and say the bereaved are getting 'unfair treatment' and that they are making a big deal when everyone's life is hard,\" Koo Jeong-woo, a sociology professor at Sungkyunkwan University, told news site The Korea Herald. \nIn later comments to the BBC, Prof Koo suggested that economic stress and a competitive job market - particularly in the wake of Covid - has left many people feeling socially isolated, exacerbating the issue of hate speech.\nMany South Koreans, he says, now \"view others not as their peers, but as adversaries\", pointing to a widespread culture of comparison in South Korea.\n\"We tend to compare a lot... if you put someone else down, it's easier to feel superior yourself,\" he told the BBC. \"That's why there's a bit of tendency in Korea to engage in hate speech or make derogatory remarks, aiming to diminish others to elevate oneself.\"\nMr Park says the families of the Jeju Air crash victims have been characterised as \"parasites squandering the nation's money\".\nBy way of example, he refers to a recent article about an emergency relief fund of three million won ($2,055; \u00a31,632) that was raised for the bereaved through donations. That article was met with a flood of malicious comments, many referencing the erroneous suggestion that taxpayers' money was used for the fund.\n\"It seems like the families of the Muan Airport victims have hit the jackpot. They must be secretly delighted,\" said one such comment. \nMr Park says these comments were \"overwhelming\".\n\"Even if compensation for the accident comes in, how could we possibly feel like recklessly spending it when it is the price of our loved ones' lives?\" he says. \"Every single one of those comments cuts us deeply. We're not here to make money.\"\n\"Too many people, instead of being sensitive, build their entertainment on others' suffering,\" he adds. \"When something like this happens, they belittle it and spew hateful remarks.\"\nJoshua Uyheng, a psychology professor in the Philippines who studies online hate,  says that hate is often \"directed towards [those] we believe are gaining some advantage at our expense\". \n\"We feel hatred when we [think we] are getting the short end of the stick.\"\nIn the case of the Jeju Air crash, political dynamics only made things worse.\nThe accident came amid a period of political turmoil in South Korea, with the country reeling from suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's shock decision to enact martial law - an incident that politically divided the country.\nMany supporters of President Yoon's right-wing People Power Party have, without evidence, pinned blame for the crash on the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), pointing to the fact that Muan Airport was originally built as part of a political pledge by the DP.\n\"The Muan airport tragedy is a man-made disaster caused by the DP,\" read one comment on YouTube. Another described it as \"100% the fault\" of the party.\nPark Han-shin, whose brother died in the plane crash, says he has been accused of being a DP member and \"fake bereaved family member\". So extensive were these claims that his daughter took to social media to call them out.\n\"It pains me deeply to see my father, who lost his brother in such a tragedy, being labelled a 'scammer'. It also makes me worried that this misinformation might lead my father to make wrong choices out of despair,\" she wrote on Threads two days after the incident.\nPark Han-shin says he is stunned by how people seem to \"enjoy taking advantage of others' pain\".\n\"That's simply not something a human being should do,\" he told the BBC. \n\"I am just an ordinary citizen. I am not here to enter politics. I came to find out the truth about my younger brother's death.\"\nWhile there are no perfect solutions to hate, experts say social media companies should establish policies on what constitutes hate speech and moderate content posted on their platforms accordingly.\n\"Online users should be able to report malicious posts and comments smoothly, and platform companies must actively delete such content,\" Prof Koo says. Law enforcement agencies should also take perpetrators to task, he adds.\nReminding people of their shared identities may also help, says Prof Uyheng.\n\"The less people feel that they are on opposite ends of a zero-sum game, perhaps the more they can feel that tragedies like these are the shared concern of us all - and that victims deserve empathy and compassion, not vitriol and condemnation.\"",

And for us, if we choose to stay, we need to pay \u00a33,000 to the UK government. Can you see the difference?\"\n\"The one thing stopping more students coming here is recent changes in the visa,\" says Mohammed Abdullah Sayyed, 21, from India. \nStudent visa restrictions took effect in January 2024, meaning postgraduates lost the right to bring dependant family members to the UK and new students were prevented from switching to a work visa before the end of their courses.\nThere was an 85% drop in the number of sponsored study visas for dependants, from 143,276 in 2023 to 21,978 in 2024.\nMohammed says another factor is international students pay more than UK ones.\nCoventry University says tuition fees can vary depending on the course - but as of September 2024, most courses cost approximately \u00a316,800 \u2013 \u00a320,050 per year for international students. \nThat's compared to \u00a39,250 for domestic students, which will rise to \u00a39,535 in September.\nCoventry University says Brexit has had \"a profound impact\" on UK universities' ability to attract EU students. \nThe House of Commons Library states the number of EU students fell sharply after changes to visa requirements and funding rules in 2021-22. \nSince August 2021, new students from the EU generally have had to pay international fees and do not qualify for tuition fee loans.\nLaura Alonso is studying international relations at Coventry University. \nThe 21-year-old from Spain says: \"There's a lot of international people and international students, especially in Coventry, so you always feel welcome\".\nBut she believes the UK's withdrawal from the Erasmus+ programme put lots of Spanish students off studying there. \nThe Turing Scheme, which replaced it, funds UK participants to study or work abroad - but does not fund international students coming to the UK. \nWhilst the number of international visas has fallen by almost a third, the number of international students applying to study in the UK via The University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) has increased.\nUCAS saw a 2.7% rise in international undergraduate applicants between 2024 and 2025\nHowever this does not represent the full picture, as UCAS figures do not account for students applying directly through colleges and universities, or postgraduate courses.\nThe overall fall in international students is impacting Coventry University's finances. It recently put hundreds of staff at risk of redundancy.\nSo it is little surprise the change is also being felt in the city's wider economy.\nCoventry University's analysis of Higher Education Policy Institute and Kaplan International's figures suggests international students generate about \u00a3651m a year for the city's economy.\nOne sign of a drop in overseas students is that several purpose-built student accommodation blocks are the subject of change-of-use planning proposals to convert them for residential use.\nThe volume of student accommodation being approved has attracted debate, with some residents objecting to planning applications. \nEstate agents report landlords selling up due to falling international student numbers.\n\nCoventry University says it is proud to widen accessibility to education: \"It would be odd to constrain our mission and values within national borders.\n\"Our long-term strategy of diversifying income to help counter the fact UK tuition fees have been frozen for several years has been successful and remains the right thing to do.\n\"The sustained growth in student numbers over a number of years allowed us to create many jobs and increased economic and social benefits. We are now having to rebalance the organisation based on changes outside of our control.\"\nThe government says its Immigration White Paper will set out \"a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system, linking immigration, skills and visa systems to grow our domestic workforce, end reliance on overseas labour and boost economic growth.\"\nVivienne Stern, CEO of Universities UK, says funding issues mean universities are reducing students' options - and the drop in international students is hurting communities.\n\"There are people in all sorts of walks of life who benefit from the fact that universities bring students in who spend money in shops and cafes - local businesses, getting their hair cut, taking taxis. \n\"It really contributes to economies right across the UK, and I think that's really special.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jonathan Fagg and Miguel Roca-Terry.",

        "article_text": "Being too hot or too cold can be bad for your health. So, what is the optimum temperature for your home?\nAs someone who feels the cold \u2013 but is reluctant to constantly turn up the thermostat \u2013 a hot water bottle and a thick fleece are two of my closest friends. And as relentless winter storms sweep the east coast of the US and Canada \u2013 and other countries across the globe are trawling through what feels like a very long winter \u2013 you might also be wondering: what is the best indoor temperature for your health and comfort? The answer, it turns out, is not straightforward.\nIn the 1860s, German physician Carl Wunderlich took the temperatures of around 25,000 people and found that the average was 37C (98.6F). This figure has been widely accepted ever since. However, new data suggests that this isn't strictly true. Body temperature can vary between individuals, with modern research suggesting that gender, metabolism, hormones, activity, age and menstruation all have an influence. So, with such variations to consider, is there an optimum temperature at which to keep your home?\nFor countries with temperate or colder climates, guidance from the World Health Organization states that a room temperature of 18C (64.4F) is safe enough to protect us from the harmful effects of cold. Being in a cold, damp or draughty environment has negative physical and mental health consequences, from worsening asthma and increased risk of heart disease, to anxiety and depression.\u00a0\n\"We recognise healthy homes are one of the key building blocks for good health. So that means homes that are accessible, safe, comfortable and warm help to protect our health, and support our communities to be healthy and resilient,\" says Rebecca Wilson, senior public health specialist at Public Health Wales in the UK, an organisation which advocates for improving links between homes and health.\nThe results of Public Health Wales's 2022 and 2023 winter surveys found that people were increasingly experiencing stress or anxiety in the three months leading up to winter due to rising heating costs (a jump from 57.2% to 66.5%). When the cold set in, more people set their thermostats to lower temperatures at home, and chose to heat specific rooms rather than the whole house \u2013 and, instead, turned to hot water bottles or blankets to stay warm.\n\"We know that all people who live in cold homes or face frugal poverty are affected. But the research does show that there's certain population groups such as older people, children, and people with disabilities and health conditions, who might be more impacted,\" says Wilson.\u00a0(Read more about how cold homes can affect health).\nEqually, overheating is also a health risk for those living in warmer climates, with an increased likelihood of heat exhaustion and heatstroke as the body desperately tries to cool itself, in turn putting stress on the heart and kidneys. Overheating can also exacerbate existing health conditions and negatively impact mental health, with links found to an increased suicide risk.\u00a0\nIt's a bleak picture. Research has shown a global link between both cold and heat exposure and mortality over the 21st Century, with experts calling for more public awareness of non-optimal temperatures as a health risk. This is becoming an increasing problem due to climate change and a longer duration and intensity of extreme weather events.\nExposure factors like occupation and socioeconomic status can play a role \u2013 outdoor manual workers often work through extreme temperatures and people living in poorer urban or rural areas may be subject to low quality, draughty housing, or in hot weather, have less access to cooling like air conditioning.\nBabies, young children and elderly people are also particularly vulnerable as they are less able to thermoregulate \u2013 meaning they are less able to maintain a core body temperature by balancing heat generation with heat loss.\u00a0\nFor example, according to The Lullaby Trust in the UK, the recommended room temperature for babies is slightly lower than average, at 16-20C (60-68F). If babies overheat, there is a risk of sudden infant death syndrome, so the charity advises using a thermometer to test the temperature of the room but also check your baby by feeling the back of their neck and chest to see if they are hot or sweaty.\u00a0\nMore like this:\u00a0\nThe average body temperature of a newborn or a young child is slightly higher than an older child or adult, usually between 36.5 and 37.5C (97.7F and 99.5F). This is because their metabolism is more active, and their body surface area is larger in relation to their body weight. As their bodies grapple with thermoregulation, it takes longer for them to sweat, so their bodies hold more heat.\u00a0\nElderly people, on the other hand, may need their homes a little warmer as they tend to have a lower resting body temperature compared to young adults. Metabolic rate decreases with age, meaning it's harder for older people's bodies to produce heat. They are also more likely to be taking medication, or be suffering from a chronic illness \u2013 both of which can affect the body's ability to thermoregulate.\u00a0Diabetes, for example, can prevent the blood flowing normally to provide warmth. Even slightly cooler homes at 18C (65F) can lead to hypothermia.\nOne study observed that the physical performance of older women between the ages of 70 and 95 in a moderately cold environment at 15C (59F) and warmer at 25C (77F). Results showed that their physical ability significantly worsened within 45 minutes at the colder temperature \u2013 highlighting the potential safety risks for older adults living independently, such as balance problems and heightened risk of falling.\u00a0\nMen and women also have biological and hormonal differences, so our sensitivity to warmer and colder temperatures will differ too. Women tend to have more fat between their skin and muscles, so while the organs are kept warm, it prevents heat from reaching the skin and extremities (hands, feet and the tip of the nose). One study found that women's hands were almost 3C (5.4F) cooler than men's when exposed to cold \u2013 perhaps explaining where the phrase \"cold hands, warm heart\" comes from.\u00a0\nMenstruation also has a role to play, as core body temperature fluctuates throughout the cycle, hitting its highest point in the luteal phase after ovulation. And pregnancy and hormonal contraceptives containing progesterone can also increase core temperature. However, as women are typically smaller in build and have a lower resting metabolic rate than men, which reduces heat production when exposed to the cold, they can also feel the cold more, despite having a higher core body temperature.\nThe extent of the variation of thermal comfort between men and women is disputed. While some research indicates that it is marginal, one study from Finland suggests that it might be more significant. Take the office environment, for example. While it's unlikely that there's a temperature which pleases everyone due to our individual thermoregulation, overall the study found that women were often dissatisfied with the room temperature, feeling both uncomfortably colder and hotter than men. Another study of office temperatures in Japan showed a 3.1C (5.6F) difference in neutral temperature between female and male workers.\nHaving a safe temperature in the workplace is crucial both for health and productivity. Heat stress can reduce physical work capacity and motor-cognitive performances, and workers \u2013 both outdoor and those in poorly insulated office buildings \u2013 exposed to cold environments can be at risk of injury, cold stress and illness. In the UK, the law requires employers to provide a reasonable indoor temperature in the workplace. Regulations suggest this should be 16C (60F) or 13C (55F) if the work involves \"rigorous physical effort\". In the US, however, while the\u00a0Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00a0recommends a work temperature in the range of 20-24C (68-76F), it does not require employers to provide heat or air conditioning for workspaces.\u00a0\nIn the home, meanwhile, reaching an optimal core body temperature may not be a \"golden ticket\" to a perfect sleep, says Bill Wisden, a sleep expert and director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at Imperial College London, \"but it would help\".\nSleep, he says, is \"temporally related to the circadian rhythm of core body temperature and skin temperature\". In other words, a couple of hours before we go to sleep, our core body temperature begins to decrease when melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep cycle, is produced. Body temperature continues to drop throughout the night reaching a low point in the early morning before gradually warming up as the morning progresses.\nOne thing that can help you fall asleep is the \"hot bath effect\". Wisden says that having a hot bath before bedtime can help induce sleep. \"We've done physiological experiments with mice and found that if you warm the skin, that sends signals to the hypothalamus in the base of the brain \u2013 and that triggers an induction of sleep and a cooling of the body.\"\u00a0\nSo, getting under a thick duvet at night can help the body prepare the body for longer episodes of sleep or deeper sleep. Snuggling up like this \u2013 to warm the skin \u2013 is not unique to humans. Wisden adds: \"Pets, cats and dogs curl up \u2013 and some animals build a nest\u2026 that provides a kind of thermal insulation.\"\u00a0\nBut once you're fast asleep, a cool room temperature is ideal: between 16-18C (60-65F). While older adults might sleep more comfortably in a room that's a couple of degrees warmer, being in a room that's too warm can cause poor sleep quality. This can lead to waking up throughout the night, as well as a lack of non-REM sleep \u2013 the most restful stage of sleep. \"Being too hot during sleep is bad. It's exactly like a noise, or a sensation on your skin, or a pain. Being hot while you're asleep stimulates sensory perception and wakes you up,\" Wisden says.\u00a0\nUltimately, while we can be guided by research, it seems it may be impossible to find an optimal temperature that will please everyone. From age to gender, hormones to metabolism, there are many factors at play that might influence whether you prefer a hotter or colder room.\nSo, the battle of the thermostat rages on.\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the\u00a0Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Getty ImagesValkyrae said the women were OK but \"in shock\"On Monday, Cinna said a clip from the stream, which has been shared widely online, \"does not do it justice for how scary it was\". \"It sucks that a marathon that was to highlight women streamers is unfortunately ending up on one of the worst things that can happen to a female streamer,\" Cinna said. \"He said he was going to kill us, he kept trying to get something out of his pocket. \"Posting on X, she also said what happened demonstrates the \"harsh reality women live in\" and hit out at online comments that it was staged to drive hits.",

No-one had ever heard of Holmes Chapel before.\n\"It's brilliant - all the businesses, we're all benefitting.\"\nA walking tour was launched last year after villagers noticed fans risking their safety near a busy by-pass while en route to nearby Twemlow Viaduct, where the singer apparently had his first kiss.\nNow fans arriving in Holmes Chapel by rail will also be greeted with a mural.\nThe design, by local artists Victoria Holland and Eamonn Murphy, is a riff on popular vintage railway posters.\nThe artwork shows a 2021 Grammys-era Styles \"standing\" in front of the viaduct.\n\"I like his style, I like how funky he is,\" Ms Holland told BBC North West Tonight.\n\"He reminds me of David Bowie in terms of the clothes he wears.\n\"I've seen fans around the village taking photos of the shops and I'm sure this is definitely going to be one of the places where they want photos taken.\"\nStyles, whose parents still live nearby, occasionally visits the area.\nBut Peter Whiers, chairman of local community group the Holmes Chapel Partnership, admits \"it's obviously difficult for him because wherever he goes, he would get mobbed\".\n\"But if he wanted to, I'm sure we could sneak him in and get him round the places.\"\nHe said locals had welcomed the extra attention, adding: \"Obviously it helps the businesses - that's the driving force.\n\"We've had some difficult years in terms of lockdown and then the economy and lots of small businesses closing.\n\"What we've had through the Harry Styles tours is people come to this village when basically the locals weren't even coming into the village because it's cold [and] wintry. \n\"But the Harries continue to come here, come rain or shine!\"\nAt the mural unveiling, Trish Cruise, who moved to the area from Liverpool, said: \"It's just a really lovely thing.\n\"I remember being a massive fan of The Beatles, from Liverpool, so it was great to go to the places that they'd been to.\n\"It's definitely inspirational and my little granddaughters, who are eight and four, just love him and sing all the words to his songs.\"\nFellow resident Nicole Hardiman added: \"We all really appreciate what he's done for the village and this (mural) was just a bit of something to show back to him that the adoration continues.\"\nThe new artwork comes ahead of Harry's Home Village Tours resuming in April.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

They go into effect tomorrow.\"\nThe three major indices in the US sank after Trump's comments.

        "article_text": "Nicky Hayen's Club Brugge beat Aston Villa in the Champions League group stage this season\nAt the time it felt like a surprise appointment for semi-professional Haverfordwest County of the Cymru Premier.\nThree years on, and with the manager who joined them on New Year's Eve 2021 leading his current side into a Champions League knockout tie against Aston Villa, it seems scarcely believable.\nNicky Hayen was the first Belgian to manage in the Welsh Premier League and remains one of only a handful of non-British or non-Irish managers to do so.\nThe 44-year-old's ascent to the latter stages of Europe's top-tier competition with Club Brugge, who knocked out Europa League holders Atalanta in the play-offs, has been as rapid as it has been impressive.\nNow he is being touted as one of Europe's \"hottest properties\", and one pundit even suggested Hayen could be Arne Slot's replacement at Liverpool.\nFew of the 273 present at Bridge Meadow Stadium when Hayen recorded the biggest home win of his Haverfordwest tenure - a 6-1 thumping of Cefn Druids - would have predicted their manager would be in such conversation only a few years later.\nBut for Haverfordwest chairman Rob Edwards, who remains close friends with Hayen and shares regular messages with him, it comes as no surprise.\n\"The guy was a workaholic,\" recalls Edwards, whose house Hayen shared while living in west Wales.\n\"I would wake up at 8am and he'd be dressed, watching clips of opposition, doing analysis. I'd go to bed at 11pm and he'd be up, watching clips and doing analysis.\"\nClub Brugge took the lead before losing 3-1 at Manchester City in January\nHayen, a former defender who played more than 400 games in Belgium and the Netherlands, reached Wales largely via coaching, technical director and caretaker manager roles in Belgium and Saudi Arabia.\nHis major managerial breakthrough at Waasland-Beveren ended in Covid-impacted relegation to the Belgian second tier.\nHe connected with Edwards via a mutual contact in Belgium and, backed by a Uefa Pro Licence and stellar presentation, wowed the board during the interview stage. \n\"We just wanted to listen to every word he said,\" explains Edwards, who took over the club in 2020 and made Hayen his first managerial appointment the following year.\n\"We decided he was the person we wanted and did all we could to get him. Fortunately, he turned up.\"\nThe experience and professionalism Hayen brought to the part-timers had an immediate impact, taking them from second-bottom to the verge of the European play-offs in fewer than six months, implementing a possession-based, passing approach rarely witnessed in the Welsh top flight.\n\"You could see by the impact he had on the players,\" says Edwards. \"He didn't try to over-coach them - just give them very detailed stats about the opposition, very detailed analysis.\n\"He spent his time getting to know the players. He was very methodical. He asked about their welfare; he was worried about the mental side of the game as well.\n\"He managed to get a really amazing standard out of players we probably didn't realise had it in them.\n\"For me, it was a massive learning curve working with someone at that level, but he was very calm. He wasn't a shouter in the dressing room - he spoke and you listened.\n\"Despite not being the loudest, most aggressive, he had an aura - you just wanted to listen to him.\"\nIt is to Hayen's credit that he slipped seamlessly into life in the Pembrokeshire market town, despite having to leave his family in Belgium.\n\"There are 14,000 people who live in Haverfordwest. It's a beautiful part of the world but a bit of a culture shock,\" says Edwards.\n\"He wasn't really too concerned about what was around him. He was focused on the football. He embraced the culture and didn't try to change anything drastically. But he was just obsessed with football.\n\"He is a family man, doesn't drink, doesn't use social media. He just gets his head down. He deserves everything he gets.\"\nClub Brugge have won five of their 10 Champions League games this season\nEdwards knew the day would come, but he was hoping the club would get a little longer with Hayen at the helm.\nWhen, in the summer of 2022, an approach arrived from Club Brugge to take over their Under-23s, Club NXT, it proved impossible for Hayen to turn down.\n\"It was a little bit of a surprise,\" says Edwards. \"I wasn't expecting to have any dialogue with a club like Club Brugge.\"\nHayen stepped in as first-team assistant after Scott Parker was sacked in 2023, before getting his chance as interim manager when Ronny Deila left last March.\nThere, Hayen found former Sint-Truiden team-mate and ex-Liverpool and Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to confide in.\n\"When [Deila] stepped down with 10 games to go last season, Nicky stepped in and won nine of them and they came out of nowhere to win the league. That was a real statement,\" says Edwards.\nIt was during that run that Jan Mulder, the former Ajax and Anderlecht striker turned pundit, made a prediction for Hayen's future.\n\"Next year [he] will play a series of matches in the Champions League, attracting the attention of Madrid, Barcelona, \u200b\u200bBayern and Manchester,\" Mulder wrote in Humo, external in May 2024.\n\"Nasser Al-Khelaifi of Paris St-Germain also joins the fight for his signature at the last minute. Personally, I think that the great Nicky Hayen will replace Arne Slot from Zwolle as manager of Liverpool within two years.\"\nThe first part of Mulder's premonition has proven to be true - Hayen's Brugge beat Villa, Sporting and Sturm Graz in the group phase, as well as drawing with Juventus and Celtic.\nThe Belgian champions followed up by defeating Atalanta in both legs of their play-off for a 5-2 aggregate victory.\nPrior to that second leg in Italy, Hayen explained how before games he always talks to his mother, who passed away four years ago.\n\"What he has achieved in the Champions League is just incredible. Club Brugge over the years have had far better sides on paper, but he is getting an incredible tune out of them,\" says Edwards.\n\"He is a workaholic, fanatical and leads from the front. I guess that is why a lot of these younger players who are coming through are working so hard for him and having great success.\"\nHayen's brief tenure in Wales also set the platform for Haverfordwest's future. In 2023, under Tony Pennock, they qualified for Europe for the first time in 19 years and only the second time in their history, reaching the Europa Conference League second qualifying round.\n\"It's great for the club to be associated with someone like that,\" says Edwards. \n\"It seems like it is only the start for him. I would love for him to go on. I am sure there will be opportunities to manage even higher if he carries on.\n\"He is probably one of the hottest properties in Europe.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "summary": "Crowds of 273 to Champions League - rise of Europe's 'hottest property' Image source, ReutersImage caption, Nicky Hayen's Club Brugge beat Aston Villa in the Champions League group stage this seasonAlex BysouthBBC Sport senior journalistPublished3 March 2025At the time it felt like a surprise appointment for semi-professional Haverfordwest County of the Cymru Premier.Three years on, and with the manager who joined them on New Year's Eve 2021 leading his current side into a Champions League knockout tie against Aston Villa, it seems scarcely believable.Nicky Hayen was the first Belgian to manage in the Welsh Premier League and remains one of only a handful of non-British or non-Irish managers to do so.The 44-year-old's ascent to the latter stages of Europe's top-tier competition with Club Brugge, who knocked out Europa League holders Atalanta in the play-offs, has been as rapid as it has been impressive.Now he is being touted as one of Europe's \"hottest properties\", and one pundit even suggested Hayen could be Arne Slot's replacement at Liverpool.Few of the 273 present at Bridge Meadow Stadium when Hayen recorded the biggest home win of his Haverfordwest tenure - a 6-1 thumping of Cefn Druids - would have predicted their manager would be in such conversation only a few years later.But for Haverfordwest chairman Rob Edwards, who remains close friends with Hayen and shares regular messages with him, it comes as no surprise. \"It's great for the club to be associated with someone like that,\" says Edwards. \"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Club Brugge have won five of their 10 Champions League games this seasonEdwards knew the day would come, but he was hoping the club would get a little longer with Hayen at the helm.When, in the summer of 2022, an approach arrived from Club Brugge to take over their Under-23s, Club NXT, it proved impossible for Hayen to turn down.

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game. They are giving corners? \nGoalkeepers used to have six seconds \u2013 then that went out the game so goalkeepers have started game management and timewasting. Now they are giving an extra two and it's eight.\nShamoon Hafez:\nIt feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.\nJust think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.\nIt also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.\nBurnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. How many other players will we see attempting to pressure the referee into enforcing the new rule?\nAlex Howell:\nIt will be interesting to see what impact the eight-second rule has on the way teams think about their build-up play.\nIt could also then have a knock-on effect on the way teams press. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.\nConor McNamara:\nI have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.\nIn essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. But in this highly-analytical world we now live in, any new 'measurable initiatives' will be given the full 'offside by a toe-nail' treatment.\nThe conspiracy theorists will love it all.\nAlso, to implement this to the letter of the law, the poor referees will have to start shouting five-second countdowns each and every time a goalkeeper has had the ball in their hands for three seconds. \nSemi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.\nAlistair Bruce-Ball:\nOne thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.\nAnything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.\nI also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.\nNick Mashiter: \nNottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.\nThe goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.\nThe Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.\nJohn Murray:\nAn interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?\nI suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. \nAnd the likelihood is it will be used only very much as a last resort and more as a warning to make it clear to goalkeepers that they need to get on with it.",

Here are some of the top moments from the biggest night in Hollywood.\nThere was an audible gasp from journalists in the winners' room when Mikey Madison was announced as the best actress winner. \nDemi Moore was the favourite for much of this campaign. Things did shift after Madison's Bafta win, but the race remained incredibly tight.\nIn the end, it was Madison's night. It marked an incredible moment for a 25-year-old actress who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nThe film tells the story of sex worker Anora, who has a whirlwind ill-fated romance with the spoilt son of a Russian oligarch.\nEdie Turquet, one of the young female dancers and strippers in the film, texted me to say it was \"insane\" that a film about sex workers could win best picture at the Oscars.\nShe added that she hoped it would \"shift or at least challenge\" perspectives of people towards her community.\nWe all knew it was coming but Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande belting out Wicked's anthem Defying Gravity was even better than we could have hoped for.\nAs Erivo, in a white gown, hit that final iconic note, the audience stood in applause.\nThe co-stars performed a medley of songs, including Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which Grande sang to open the show wearing a gorgeous red sequined dress.\nEarlier in the night, Grande stunned on the red carpet with a champagne Schiaparelli gown, which leaned into her role as Glinda the Good Witch in the film.\n\"It's giving chandelier,\" one reporter said to me backstage.\nOn social media the big question was: \"How is she going to sit down in that dress?\"\nOn the red carpet, there was quite a moment when Halle Berry ran up to Adrien Brody and gave him a big kiss. \nIt recreated a moment at the 2003 Academy Awards, when Brody - having just won best actor for his performance in The Pianist - turned and kissed Berry, who had presented the award to him.\nShe told Variety: \"I had to pay him back\".\nSpeaking to Extra, she added that the only reason she did it was because Brody's girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, \"was fine\" with it.\nThe Oscars wrote on X with a clip of the kiss: \"A reunion 22 years in the making\".\nBerry and Brody weren't the only two seen locking lips.\nInside the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre, lovebirds Kylie Jenner and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were photographed sharing a kiss and laughing together.\nReality star and makeup mogul Jenner was there to support her boyfriend who was up for best actor - but ended up losing out to... Brody.\nActor Adam Sandler was in on the ongoing jokes about his typically casual attire.\nEarly on in the night, host Conan O'Brien called him out, saying he was \"dressed like a guy playing video poker at 2am\".\n(For reference, Sandler was in the audience wearing a blue hoodie and shorts, an ensemble that looked more at home on the basketball court).\nFollowing a playful back and forth between the two, the actor walked into the aisle of the theatre and said he was \"leaving\" before going over to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and shouting his surname, in the way he previously did on Saturday Night Live.\nChalamet, ever good natured, laughed along.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, which killed 29 people. \nThe Grammys and Golden Globes both made the fires a central theme of the show.\nThe Academy Awards mentioned it only a handful of times, signalling Hollywood is moving on.\nThere was, however, one powerful moment, when O'Brien welcomed some of the firefighters who fought the blazes on stage. He called them \"heroes\", with the audience clapping and giving the emergency workers a standing ovation.\nO'Brien then said there are some jokes that even he isn't brave enough to tell - and asked some of the firefighters to read them out instead. \nLA Fire Captain Erik Scott read one joke off a teleprompter that said their hearts go out to everyone who lost their homes - including the makers of Joker 2.\nIt got a big laugh and O'Brien called it the best joke delivery of the night.\nIt was Zoe Salda\u00f1a's first Oscar, winning best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez - a musical about a transgender Mexican drug lord - and it marked one of the most powerful and emotional speeches of the night. \nShe broke down in tears immediately, crying out \"Mommy\", to her mother in the audience.\n\"I am floored by this honour,\" she wept, paying tribute to her fellow nominees for their \"loving and community\", saying \"I will pay it forward\".\nPraising the film's cast and crew, she got emotional as she talked about her family.\n\"Everything brave, outrageous and good I've ever done in my life is because of you,\" she said, praising her husband, his \"beautiful hair\" and their three sons.\n\"My grandmother came to this country in 1961 - I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands.\n\"I'm the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award and I know I won't be the last.\n\"Getting an award where I got to sing and speak in Spanish - this is for my grandmother.\"\nThe month-long saga to obtain a US visa by two Iranian filmmakers ended in the pair winning the best animated short film Academy Award - with them rushing to even make the ceremony in Hollywood. \nHossein Molayemi and Shirin Sohani arrived at Los Angeles airport just hours before the Oscars award ceremony was due to begin.\nAfter their plane landed, they quickly changed outfits in a public restroom and made it with only moments to go before winning the award for their film, In the Shadow of the Cypress.\n\"It's not our fault we are so late,\" Sohani said to BBC News before the show. \"We couldn't get a visa. It's a difficult relationship\" between the US and Iran, she explained.\n\"Until yesterday we hadn't obtained our visa and now we are standing here with this statuette in our hands,\" said Molayemi in his acceptance speech.\n\"Speaking in front of this expectant audience is very hard for us,\" he added. \"Yes, if we preserve and remain faithful, miracles will happen.\"\nAs ever, politics reared its head during Sunday night's ceremony.\nHost O'Brien made a quip about how Anora was \"having a good night\", before saying: \"I guess Americans are excited to see somebody finally stand up to a powerful Russian.\"\nO'Brien must have been writing his monologue up to the very last minute, because the joke appeared to be a nod to the White House spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump.\nMeanwhile, the No Other Land documentary team descended on the red carpet wearing Palestinian scarves and Kufiya. Their film is set in the occupied West Bank. After they won for the film, the team took the stage and called out US policy in the region.\nKill Bill star Daryl Hannah also veered into politics while on stage. She referenced the war in Ukraine, saying \"Slava Ukraini\", the country's salute, as she presented an award.\nBut one person wasn't mentioned. \nHere in liberal Hollywood, you may have expected jokes and barbs toward Donald Trump - but his name didn't come up even once.",

He is four off his record of 12 at United in 2011\u201312.\n\"Danny was great to play alongside. If I'm being honest I would like to see him here at Manchester United,\" said former Red Devils and England team-mate Wayne Rooney on BBC One.\nWelbeck (centre front) won the 2012-13 Premier League title with Manchester United\nWelbeck, a Mancunian born to parents from Ghana, came through the academy at Manchester United and scored 29 goals in 142 games for the club.\nLoan spells at Preston and Sunderland both ended early because of injury.\nAfter being at the club from the age of eight to 23, he went to Arsenal for \u00a316m - with United signing Monaco forward Radamel Falcao on loan instead.\nInjuries would follow him to Arsenal, where he netted 32 goals in 126 games over five years.\nHe missed the 2015 FA Cup final, then eight months out in 2016 cost him a chance of going to Euro 2016 and his final game for the club came in November 2018, when he broke his ankle.\nThe following season he only played half of Watford's games as they went down.\nAnd then came his move to Brighton.  \nWith former clubs United and Arsenal struggling for goalscoring frontmen, they might both wish they still had the services of Welbeck.\nAfter 26 goals in his first four seasons at Brighton, Welbeck has hit eight in 25 this season.\nAmong those eight have been some big ones.\nHe netted in a 2-1 win over Manchester United in August, scored two winners at St James' Park this season and also got winning goals over Tottenham and Bournemouth.\n\"It's great to get the winning goal,\" he said after the cup win at Newcastle, where he came on as an 80th-minute substitute.\n\"I am feeling very good, feeling fit and feeling strong. Thanks to my mum and dad for giving me good genes.\"\nHe added: \"When you're on the bench you have to analyse the game and see where you can make a difference and today that's what we did.\"\nThis video can not be played\nArchive: Sweden v England - Euro 2012\nIt might seem fanciful - but some are wondering if Welbeck's form could earn him an international recall.\nWelbeck scored 16 goals in 42 games for England, making his debut in 2011 against Ghana, the nation of his parents.

Five years after it looked as though Danny Welbeck's career was petering out, the 34-year-old sent Albion into the FA Cup quarter-finals.When Welbeck played 18 times and scored twice in Watford's Premier League relegation campaign in 2019-20, it didn't seem like there were great days ahead of him.The former (more on this later) England frontman left the Hornets on a free transfer and joined Brighton after the transfer window had closed in October 2020.An un-Brighton-like signing, a 29-year-old injury-prone forward - surely just a stop-gap?And yet, the two-time FA Cup winner with Arsenal has had a storming time in Sussex - capped off by his latest goal.In extra time of their FA Cup fifth-round tie with Newcastle, he ran on to Solly March's pass before clipping a clever finish over Martin Dubravka from a tight angle to make it 2-1.That is his eighth goal of the season - only behind two of his Manchester United seasons and one at Arsenal. \"It's great to get the winning goal,\" he said after the cup win at Newcastle, where he came on as an 80th-minute substitute. Welbeck finds a home at AlbionWith former clubs United and Arsenal struggling for goalscoring frontmen, they might both wish they still had the services of Welbeck.After 26 goals in his first four seasons at Brighton, Welbeck has hit eight in 25 this season.Among those eight have been some big ones.He netted in a 2-1 win over Manchester United in August, scored two winners at St James' Park this season and also got winning goals over Tottenham and Bournemouth. \"'Might be possible' - Could Welbeck win England recall?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Archive: Sweden v England - Euro 2012It might seem fanciful - but some are wondering if Welbeck's form could earn him an international recall.Welbeck scored 16 goals in 42 games for England, making his debut in 2011 against Ghana, the nation of his parents.",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

The UK has committed \u00a37.8bn in military support during the same period.\nThe US decision to pause military aid came hours after Trump criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for saying the end of the war with Russia is \"very, very far away\".\nThe pair had an explosive spat in the Oval Office last Friday, with Trump telling Zelensky he was \"gambling with World War Three\" by refusing to consider a ceasefire without US security guarantees.\nZelensky left the White House before a proposed deal on sharing Ukrainian minerals with American companies could be signed.\nOn Monday, the White House announced it was \"reviewing\" the delivery of ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine to \"ensure that it is contributing to a solution\".\nThe order to pause all current American military aid to Ukraine takes effect immediately, and includes all US military equipment not currently in Ukraine, including weapons in transit and at depots in Poland.\nThe pause will affect more than $1bn (\u00a3790m) in arms and ammunition, including rockets, anti-tank weapons, and armoured vehicles of the kind Ukraine has relied on in its effort to repel Russian forces.\nThe pause in aid will heap more pressure on Zelensky to sign the minerals deal and agree to peace talks without the US security guarantees he has been seeking.\nRussia has tentatively welcomed the pause in US aid to Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling it a \"solution which could really push the Kyiv regime to a peace process\".\nFedir Venislavsky, a member of  the Ukrainian Parliament's defence committee, said his country had a weapons stockpile that would last six months \"without consistent help from the US\".\nIn an interview with Fox News, US Vice-President JD Vance said the door was open for Ukraine to return to negotiations if Zelensky was \"willing to seriously talk peace\".\nVance also drew criticism for saying that giving the US an \"economic upside in the future of Ukraine\" through the minerals deal was a better security guarantee for the country than \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\". \nSo far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any eventual peace deal in Ukraine, although Sir Keir has previously said a \"number of countries\" have agreed to commit troops.\nVance did not specify which country he was referring to, but later insisted he did not \"mention the UK or France in the clip, both of whom have fought bravely alongside the US over the last 20 years, and beyond\".\nConservative shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge had earlier accused Vance of ignoring the \"sacrifice\" of British and French troops, calling the comments \"deeply disrespectful\". \nReacting to the decision, Rayner told the BBC the Trump administration wanted Europe to step up and had been clear about its intentions to end the war in Ukraine.\nRayner said the prime minister was also \"laser-focused on getting peace\".\n\"He won't be derailed by announcements,\" Rayner told Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"He will continue that dialogue with our oldest and strongest ally, the US, and with European partners and with Ukraine.\"\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the UK and Europe must \"rearm faster\" following the US announcement.\nShe said: \"The news overnight that America is halting military aid to Ukraine is profoundly worrying.\"\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said the pause in aid between the US and Ukraine only helped Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nHe posted: \"I hope that Keir Starmer can use his new role to bring the two together and soon.\"\nLast week, Sir Keir met Trump at the White House, as the prime minister attempted the shape the American approach to ending the war in Ukraine.\nOver the weekend, Sir Keir hosted a summit of western leaders, as they scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe UK and France are taking a leading role and have both committed to send soldiers to Ukraine, under one proposal.\nBut apart from increasing spending on defence, there appears to be no consensus on a plan to end the war among European leaders.\nOn Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented a five-part plan to mobilise some \u20ac800bn (\u00a3660m) for Europe's defence and help provide \"immediate\" military support for Ukraine.\n\"This is a moment for Europe, and we are ready to step up,\" von der Leyen said.\nA UK government spokesperson said: \"We remain absolutely committed to securing a lasting peace in Ukraine and are engaging with key allies in support of this effort. \n\"It is the right thing to do, and is in our interest to do so.\" ",

        "article_text": "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.\nCharli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.\nUS star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.\nBut no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.\nListen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night. \nThe pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.\nReleased in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nIn the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nCritics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age. \nKnowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.\n\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.\n\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nTeddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.\nJade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all. \nAs well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.\nOver the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.\nJack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.\nAs ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.\n\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.\nLater, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".\n\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"\nSpeaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.\n\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.\n\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"\n\"I'm wearing shades because I mashed up my eye playing padel [ball],\" said Stormzy, as he accepted the prize for best rap/hip-hop artist.\n\"I've got a very sore eye. I've got a bruised cornea.\n\"My eye's sore under here, I'm not being a mad man with shades on inside.\"\nSabrina Carpenter pretended to pleasure a royal guardsman. \nCharli XCX gave a speech in a see-through top, with no bra. \nOne of Jade Thirlwall's dancers mooned at the camera. \nDanny Dyer uttered one of the English language's most offensive swear words.\nI'd guess that ITV's responses to Ofcom are going to make an interesting read.\nWord of the censor's concerns even filtered through to the arena during the show, much to Charli's annoyance.\n\"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said from the podium. I feel like we're in the era of free the nipple though, right?\"\nAs fans applauded, the singer grimaced: \"They put the clap track on, cool. Thanks for being on my side.\"\nThe Brits were set up in 1977 to celebrate the British Music Industry, and they are run by the BPI - an organisation funded by, and representing, the biggest record labels in the country.\nBut lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.\n\"Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments - because moments fade and careers take time,\" said Myles Smith. \"So please stick with artists past a viral hit.\"\nChappell Roan, who won best international artist, had a similar plea.\n\"I had to write a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones - and artists deserve that freedom, to explore horrible concepts, and to flop, and rise, and not be pressured into making music based off of what's trending.\"\nCharli XCX's multiple victories proved their point. Signed at the age of 14, she had to fight to make the music she wanted - after years of being told her songs were too abrasive and uncommercial.\n\"It feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven't made any sacrifices,\" she said.\n\"I've been doing my own thing in my own corner of the industry - and I guess, this time, culture caught up with us.\"\nMyles Smith has had an incredible 12 months. After giving up his job to pursue music, his feel-good pop anthem Stargazing went viral. So viral that it ended up as the best-selling British song of 2024.\nAsked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.\n\"And that said two things. One: This is like, the most irritating thing. But at the same time, I had made it to hold.\"\n\"Did you sing it for the operator when they picked up?\" we asked. \n\"No, I was passed to seven more people.\"\nSee? Being a pop star doesn't give you any shortcuts in the world of broadband service provider call centres.\nWhy did Jared Leto open his red carpet interview by trying to teach us an English accent?\nTo find out, you'd have to ask Jared Leto and, frankly, we're too scared.\nSabrina Carpenter was the night's biggest star - opening the show with a cheeky wink, a phalanx of bearskin-wearing guards and a vaudevillian mash-up of Espresso, Bed Chem and... er, Rule, Britannia.\nBut was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?\nThe prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).\nSix years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.\nTo be fair, the singer racked up an incredible 21 weeks at number one in the UK singles chart last year - more than anyone has ever achieved in a single calendar year - so her trophy wasn't entirely undeserved. \nA lot of viewers were left perplexed when Jack Whitehall sat down with Danny Dyer and what appeared to be his date: A woman with a horse for a face (we're not being unkind, see above for proof).\nWell, it turns out that Danny's neighbour was a German DJ who goes by the name of HorsegiirL and keeps their identity hidden behind a mask. Sort of like Deadmau5, but with fetlocks.\nMaybe next year she can come back to do a duet with Foals.\n \nEzra Collective made history by becoming the first jazz band to win the Brit Award for best group - beating previous title-holders like Coldplay, The Cure and Bring Me The Horizon.\nTaking to the stage, frontman Femi Koleoso had a few words to say about cuts to music education, and the lack of funding for youth clubs like Tomorrow's Warriors - where his band got their start.\n\"I'll bang this drum a bunch of times and I'll continue to do so until the entire country gets it\", he said.\n\"This moment right here is because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music.\n\"The reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK...  we're unsure of how to fix it, but the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies in giving a young person a saxophone.\n\"Because when you do that, you give them a dream, an aspiration and a goal.\"\nTo prove his point, he invited the London youth group Kinetika Bloco onto the stage of the O2, to blast through Ezra Collective's infectiously upbeat jazz anthem Shaking Body.\nThis year's Brit Award trophies, designed by Gabriel Moses, were cast in bronze... And they were heavy. \nWeighing 1.6kg each, you could break a toe if you dropped one. And Charli had to pick up four of the things for her winner's photo.\nIt took approximately six people to arrange them in her arms (\"don't push them between my boobs\", she squealed at one point) before she was ready for the flashbulbs.\n\"Is this lame?\" she asked at the last moment. \"It feels lame.\"\nThen she dropped them all and fell to the floor in a fit of giggles.",

        "article_text": "When most of us are stressed out we're able to intuitively name the emotion because of the way it makes us feel.\nBut when Dr Krysia Waldock is struggling it can take a bit longer for the penny to drop.\nThat's because they are one of up to 10% of the population that experiences alexithymia.\nThe word alexithymia derives from Greek and translates roughly as \"no words for emotions\".\nPeople who experience the phenomenon, which is not widely known about, can have difficulties expressing their emotions, recognising their emotions and telling the difference between different emotions.\n\"For me, a lot of the time it's struggling to know how I feel,\" said Dr Waldock.\n\"So something will happen, I'll know that there is a feeling, but I don't know what it is and it'll take me a while, if at all, to figure out what I'm feeling.\"\nIdentifying stress can be particularly challenging. \n\"Sometimes when I'm stressed or anxious, for example, I feel it in my body, feel it in my jaw a lot, I'll bump into things, drop things... I'll know something's out but I won't necessarily put two and two together,\" they said.\n\"So it will either take a very long time for me to put it together or it just will not be put together at all.\"\nDr Waldock, who uses they/them pronouns, is autistic. Research suggests autistic people are up to five times more likely to experience alexithymia compared to the general population. \n\"For me, it's part of being autistic and neurodivergent,\" they said. \nAlexithymia is closely related to interoception, which is the ability to interpret and label internal signals from your body such as when you are hungry, tired or need to go to the toilet. \nDr Waldock said on occasion they do not experience hunger cues so eat at set times to ensure they do not miss meals. \nDr Waldock is a research assistant at Swansea University and is currently working on a project that aims to better understand autistic people's reproductive health experiences throughout their life.\nTheir colleague, the project's research officer Dr Rebecca Ellis, also has autism and alexithymia.\nDr Ellis said the experience of alexithymia differed from person to person and was also more common among people with anxiety and depression.\nSome people have always had alexithymia whereas others acquire it through trauma, she said. \nShe said she struggled to tell the difference between feeling anxious and excited.\n\"Both of them can feel quite similar and quite uncomfortable as well,\" she said. \n\"If I went on a rollercoaster I'm just sat there worried so why would I go on it?\"\nShe also finds it hard to tell if she is apprehensive or looking forward to something. \n\"That's a big ball of confusion for me,\" she laughed. \n\"So even if it's a lovely social event that I'm looking forward to... I'm always kind of feeling a little bit positive and maybe a little bit negative about it.\"\nBoth Dr Ellis and Dr Waldock have found ways of working with their alexithymia.\nDr Ellis said asking others questions about how they are able to identity their emotions could be useful.\n\"It can be something that you can learn to get better at,\" she said. \n\"You can get an understanding of your emotions and feelings.\"\nDr Waldock uses an app called How We Feel which lists different feelings and definitions which they can use to help identify how they are feeling. \nBoth agreed being given a non-judgmental heads up from those close to them when they were acting differently could be useful.  \nThere are no set diagnostic criteria for alexithymia so why is having a term like this useful? \n\"I think it allows you to be kinder to yourself,\" said Dr Ellis.\n\"Having that term not only means that more people than just yourself are experiencing it, but it also means that you and others can understand it a bit better too.\"\nDr Waldock agreed.\n\"As I've started learning about what it means to be autistic, and that includes experiences like alexithymia, it's really helped me get to know myself a bit better,\" they said.\n\"Growing up I was the square peg in the round hole scenario consistently whereas now I've stopped trying to push myself into that wrong hole as much.\"",

        "article_text": "This story contains distressing details from the start \nWhen Mauricette Vinet speaks of her grandson, her voice grows warm with affection.\n\"He was a lovely little boy. He had a strong personality, for sure! But he always thought of others, always asked if he could help,\" says the French retiree, in her 80s.\n\"He loved to be out in the garden with his grandfather, picking green beans. He was a charming boy, Mathis,\" she adds.\n\"But, as you know, there was a 'before' - and there was an 'after'.\"\nMauricette and her husband Roland are among the 267 plaintiffs who have pressed charges against Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, the French former surgeon who is accused of abusing almost 300 people - mostly children, and almost all his patients - over the course of several decades. The trial started in Vannes, Brittany, on Monday. \nLe Scouarnec and Mathis only crossed paths once, when Mathis, aged 10, was hospitalised overnight at the clinic in the small French north-western town of Quimperl\u00e9. Le Scouarnec - a mild-mannered, respected gastroenterologist - told Mathis' parents the boy had to be kept overnight for checks.\nIt turned out Mathis only had a stomach ache, and he was sent home the next day. But Mauricette is convinced the brief hospital stay changed Mathis forever.\n\"The unease set in, little by little. It happened gradually in the first year; then he stopped being happy and became aggressive with everyone,\" she tells the BBC.\nThere is no way to establish conclusively whether Mathis' troubles were linked to the surgeon. What is certain is that in his teenage years Mathis distanced himself from his family and started using increasingly hard drugs; later, he spent time in detox and rehab centres.\nThen, in 2018, police knocked on his door. \nThey told him a man named Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec had been arrested the year before for raping his six-year-old neighbour. During a search of the surgeon's home, police uncovered stacks of diaries and hard disks in which Le Scouarnec appeared to list hundreds more victims. Mathis' name was among them.\nMauricette said Mathis told her police then read out an excerpt of the diary to him, which seemed to detail abuse Le Scouarnec's inflicted on him during his hospital stay.\n\"Then they left. Mathis shut the door and was left on his own, with no help. And that was the beginning of a descent into hell,\" Mauricette says.\nThe police visit helped Mathis make sense of flashbacks that had long plagued him, Mauricette says: \"His malaise finally made sense; he traced it to the source.\"\nMathis pressed charges against Le Scouarnec, but the revelations sent him down a spiral which came to an abrupt end on 14 April 2021, when Mathis overdosed and died. He was 24.\nMauricette and her husband pressed charges the very next day, and they are now listed as \"indirect victims\" of Le Scouarnec. They have attended court in Vannes, north-western France, every day since the trial opened on Monday.\nIt has not been an easy listen. \nThe testimony of witnesses - mostly close relatives of Le Scouarnec, now 74 \u2013 painted a picture of an apparently ordinary middle-class family which, behind the scenes, has been ravaged by child abuse, incest and sexual violence.\nAnnie, Le Scouarnec's sister, said she had been \"taught to keep quiet\". \nThis week, it was all brought out in the open. \nAll three sons of Le Scouarnec struck an almost apologetic tone as they told the court about their happy childhoods with a cultured, intellectual father who may not have been particularly present but who was kind, patient and supportive. \n\"We had holidays, nice houses - everything that constitutes a normal family,\" said one.\nThe youngest son \u2013 who said he stopped contact with Le Scouarnec in 2017 \"to preserve the image of him I have from my childhood\" \u2013 said he now \"looked upon everyone with distrust\" and never left his own toddler alone with anybody. \n\"I am always worried that if my father could do this then my neighbour could, my partner, anyone,\" the 37-year-old said.\nLater the middle son \u2013 a tall man in his early 40s who admitted he was a \"not totally abstinent alcoholic\" \u2013 shared his memories of being abused at the hands of his paternal grandfather, Le Scouarnec's father.\nHe was shocked as he was told for the first time in court that among his father's alleged victims were some of his childhood friends.\nAnd, on Friday, a stunned silence descended upon the courtroom as Le Scouarnec admitted he had abused his granddaughter - his eldest son's daughter when she was under five years old. Moments after the revelation, the 44-year-old and his partner left the room to be assisted by a psychologist.\nOther witnesses sparked consternation in the plaintiffs. Due to their sheer number, they sit in a separate room \u2013 a former university lecture hall \u2013 and follow proceedings via video link.\nChristian D., a friend of Le Scouarnec now aged 80, often answered questions from the court sarcastically and repeatedly minimised the events at the centre of the trial, declaring that he could not \"afford to cry over everything that happened in the world\".\nLater, he insisted that he \"never saw anything, therefore had nothing to say\" about the devastating allegations against his friend. When he stated that he would take in Le Scouarnec if he was ever to leave jail, many alleged victims in the lecture hall got up and left their seats.\nBut most difficult for Mauricette and Roland was the much-awaited testimony of Marie-France L., Le Scouarnec's ex-wife.\nIt has been alleged that she was at the centre of the omerta that reigned in the Le Scouarnec family, as she was repeatedly made aware of her husband's obsession with children but did nothing to stop it.\nMany lawyers and plaintiffs now believe she could have spared hundreds of children from being abused. Le Scouarnec's brother - who was also heard this week - openly wondered whether she had been too enamoured by the lifestyle provided by her husband's salary to speak out.\nMarie-France has always denied this and, at the stand, was frequently defiant in the face of the accusations levelled at her.\n\"Catastrophe has struck: she knows I am a paedophile,\" Le Scouarnec wrote as early as the mid-1990s in his diary. \"Perhaps he was talking about his conscience,\" Marie-France told the court.\nShe also suggested her five-year-old niece \u2013 who Le Scouarnec has been convicted of raping \u2013 had most likely \"manipulated\" her husband. \n\"She's devious, that one. She loves the attention,\" she said. Later, she complained that she was being \"blamed\" for everything. Only when she was shown an indecent photo montage Le Scouarnec made of their son as a child did she look visibly shocked.\n\"That was absolute theatre,\" Mauricette told the BBC, adding that Christian D.'s testimony had been \"vile\" and that she thought Marie-France was living in \"pure denial\".\nAs the gut-wrenching events played out, Le Scouarnec sat in his box \u2013 mostly reactionless, but at times noticeably agitated, his voice cracking as he asked his sons for forgiveness. He flinched when excerpts of his diary were read out, and averted his eyes as indecent photographs he took of his nieces were shown.\nHis lawyers have said he admits to the \"majority\" of the charges against him, and that he will explain himself over the course of the trial, which is due to last until June. \nThe alleged victims will take the stand from next week; Mauricette and Roland will do so in April. \"I will look at Le Scouarnec and tell him what is deep in my heart - he killed my grandson,\" Mauricette says.\n\"Not with a gun, but he killed him,\" she adds. \"He's going to get 20 years, but his victims... will have to live with this their whole lives.\n\"Their sentences will be longer than his.\"\nThroughout the week, over in the victims' hall, people came and went, but the majority stayed for hours on end each day.\nAs descriptions of trauma and abuse poured in, one middle-aged woman covered her face with her hand and kept it there a long time. \nNext to her, a young man rubbed his eyes repeatedly, then stood up and left.",

        "article_text": "A $53bn (\u00a341.4 billion) reconstruction plan to rival President Donald Trump's idea for the US to \"take over Gaza\" and move out more than two million Palestinians has been approved by Arab leaders at an emergency summit in the Egyptian capital Cairo.\n\"The Egypt plan is now an Arab plan,\" announced the secretary general of the Arab League Ahmed Aboul Gheit at the end of this hours-long gathering.\nWithout referring specifically to President Trump's ideas, he underlined that \"the Arab stance is to reject any displacement, whether it is voluntary or forced\".\nEgypt had produced a detailed blueprint, with a 91-page glossy document including images of leafy neighbourhoods and grand public buildings, to counter a US scheme labelled as a \"Middle East Riviera\" which shocked the Arab world and beyond.\nWhat sets this new plan apart is it is not just about property development; its banners are politics and the rights of Palestinians.\nIn his opening remarks, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi also called for a parallel plan alongside the physical reconstruction to move towards what is known as the two state solution \u2013 a Palestinian state alongside Israel. This is widely seen by Arab states, and many others, as the only lasting solution to this perpetual conflict, but it is firmly ruled out by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies.\nThis new plan proposes that Gaza would be run, temporarily, by a \"Gaza management committee under the umbrella of the Palestinian government\" comprised of qualified technocrats.\nIt glosses over the issue of what role, if any, Hamas, will play. There is a vague reference to the \"obstacle\" of militant groups and said this issue would be resolved if the causes of the conflict with Israel were removed.\nSome Arab states are known to be calling for the complete dismantling of Hamas; others believe those decisions should be left up to the Palestinians. Hamas is said to have accepted it will not play a role in running Gaza but has made it clear that disarming is a red line.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described President Trump's plan as \"visionary\", has repeatedly ruled out any future role for Hamas, but also for the Palestinian Authority.\nThe other sensitive issue of security was dealt with by calling on the UN Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers.\nAnd a major international conference will be held next month to raise the huge sums of money necessary for this rebuilding project.\nWealthy Gulf states appear willing to foot some of the colossal bill. But no one is ready to invest unless they are absolutely convinced buildings won't come crashing down in another war.\nA fragile ceasefire which now seems to be on the brink of collapse will only amplify that hesitation.\nThis new Arab plan to rebuild Gaza would unfold in three phases including an initial period of about six months, called the early recovery stage, to start clearing the massive amounts of rubble as well as unexploded ordinance. Two subsequent stages would last several years.\nDuring this time displaced Palestinians, said to number 1.5 million, would be housed in temporary containers. Photographs in the glossy brochure present them as well-built and designed housing units set in pretty landscaped areas.\nPresident Trump continues to wonder aloud \"Why wouldn't they want to move?\" His description of Gaza as a \"demolition site\" underlines how the territory lies in utter ruin. The UN says 90% of homes are damaged or destroyed. \nAll the basics of a life worth living, from schools and hospitals to sewage systems and electricity lines, are shredded.\nThe US President deepened the shock and anger around his ideas when he posted an AI-generated video of a golden Gaza on his Truth Social account which featured a shimmering statue of himself, his close ally Elon Musk enjoying snacks on the beach, and he and the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu sunning themselves, shirtless. All to a catchy tune, with lines like \"Trump Gaza is finally here\".\n\"They had President Trump in mind,\" remarked one Western diplomat who attended a briefing about Egypt's plan at the foreign ministry in Cairo. \"It's very glossy and very well-prepared.\"\nCairo's proposal is said to have drawn on a wide range of expertise, from World Bank professionals on sustainability, to Dubai developers on hotels.  \nThere are also lessons learned from other ravaged cities which rose from the ruins including Hiroshima, Beirut, and Berlin.

This is widely seen by Arab states, and many others, as the only lasting solution to this perpetual conflict, but it is firmly ruled out by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies.This new plan proposes that Gaza would be run, temporarily, by a \"Gaza management committee under the umbrella of the Palestinian government\" comprised of qualified technocrats.It glosses over the issue of what role, if any, Hamas, will play. Hamas is said to have accepted it will not play a role in running Gaza but has made it clear that disarming is a red line.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has described President Trump's plan as \"visionary\", has repeatedly ruled out any future role for Hamas, but also for the Palestinian Authority.Egypt's plan for Gaza's reconstruction is presented in a 91-page brochureThe other sensitive issue of security was dealt with by calling on the UN Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers.And a major international conference will be held next month to raise the huge sums of money necessary for this rebuilding project.Wealthy Gulf states appear willing to foot some of the colossal bill. And the proposed designs are also influenced by Egypt's own experience in developing its \"New Cairo\", its grand megaproject which has seen a new administrative capital rising from the desert \u2013 at great expense.The American President has said he won't \"force\" his ideas on anyone but still insists his plan is the one \"that really works\".Now it is up to the Arab states and their allies to prove that their plan is the only plan.Middle EastIsrael-Gaza warEgyptPalestinian territoriesHamasDonald TrumpUnited States",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nJonas turned professional in 2017 and has won 16 fights, lost two and drawn one \nNatasha Jonas v Lauren Price\nVenue: Royal Albert Hall, London Date: Friday, 7 March\nCoverage: Follow live text commentary from 20:00 GMT and radio coverage from 21:00 on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds, BBC Sport website & app\nSetbacks lead to comebacks. Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Support for Ukraine has become a key issue since Donald Trump returned to the White House.\nPresident Trump has made a number of claims about how much the United States has spent compared to European countries.\nBut some of his claims are questionable - with no evidence to back them up.\nPresident Trump has made this claim on a number of occasions - including when he hosted France's President Macron in the White House this week.\nShort answer: Figures suggest the actual spend is much lower.\nBBC Verify can find no evidence to back up the claim.  There are different calculations on US spending in or related to Ukraine - and they produce a much lower figure.\nThe Kiel Institute is a German-based think tank tracking support going into Ukraine.  It calculated that the United States spent $119.7bn (\u00a394.3bn) on aid between January 2022 and December 2024.\nOthers have reached a higher figure - but with a broader definition of what counts as spending on Ukraine.\nThe US Department of Defense has provided a figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIt says $182.8bn has been \"appropriated\" - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.\nEither way, both figures are considerably lower than claimed by the president.\nWe asked the White House about the basis for the $350bn claim. So far, it hasn't provided an explanation.\nPresident Trump has claimed: \"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference\"\nShort answer: Figures suggest Europe has spent more when all aid is included and, as above, we can't find any evidence for the $300bn figure.\nThe United States is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the United States, according to the Kiel Institute.\nThe figure includes aid directly from the European Union, but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.\nThey calculate that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine. In the same period, the United States spent $119.7bn, according to their figures.\nNATO secretary general Mark Rutte made a similar argument, adding Canada into his calculation.\nMr Rutte said February 2025: \"In 2024, NATO Allies provided over 50 billion euros in security assistance to Ukraine \u2013 nearly 60% of this coming from Europe and Canada.\"\nWe asked for NATO's figures, but they said they were classified.\nThis is a claim President Trump made when he hosted President Macron. It prompted President Macron to disagree, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.\nShort answer: The EU has provided loans, but also grants. \nPresident Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures. But they suggest President Trump also has a point; the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.\nHowever, again, there are different figures out there.\nThe European Union says EU countries have provided around $145bn in aid so far and that just 35% of that has been loans. Like the United States Department of Defence, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.\nEU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.\nWhat we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been a mixture of loans and grants.\nThe UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine - the latest was a $2.8bn (\u00a32.26bn) loan agreement signed during President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to London on 1 March.\nThe only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.\nBut the UK contributions are much smaller than the United States.\nThat raises a question for the UK and other European countries; if the United States withdraws a large part of its funding to Ukraine, can other states make up the difference?\nThat would require a significant increase in their contributions.\n\nAdditional reporting: Thomas Spencer and Tamara Kovacevic\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "For the third week in a row, Pope Francis has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person, with the Vatican publishing his written comments instead.\nVatican officials said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written \"in the past few days\". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care.\n\"I feel in my heart the 'blessing' that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,\" he wrote.\n\"At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.\"\nThe Pope usually makes his address from a window of the official Vatican appartments, drawing a crowd below on St Peter's Square. \nMany Catholics come specially for the chance to see him but this is now the longest Pope Francis has been out of the public eye since he was elected. \nEach evening on the square, a group of cardinals lead people in prayers for his health.\nIn his latest written address, the Pope told Catholics that he felt their \"affection and closeness\" and felt \"carried and supported by all God's people\". \nThe Vatican said he remained stable on Sunday, although doctors still describe his overall condition - with pneumonia - as \"complex\" and the risk of another infection is high. After 16 days in hospital, they are still giving no prognosis.\nThe medical team has not spoken directly to journalists for over a week, and all updates are coming via Vatican officials.\nOn Sunday, they said the Pope no longer required \"non-invasive mechanical ventilation, only high-flow oxygen therapy\". \nHe does not have a fever and was able to participate in mass in a chapel on the 10th floor of Rome's Gemelli hospital where he is being treated.\nThe Pope also received two visitors - Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Parolin and his deputy Monsignor Pena Parra. They are the first to be mentioned by the Vatican in almost a week.\nThere are no details about the length of time the men spent with him or what was discussed.\nThe latest details do suggest that the Pope has rallied somewhat since Friday, when he suffered a second breathing \"crisis\" which doctors had worried might have a lasting impact.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nSuperb Wigan thrash Warrington in Las Vegas\nLas Vegas, a city built around extravagance and opulence, with the blinking bright lights of giant electric billboards, garish neon signs and enormous flashing video screens, feels about as far away from the traditional northern England rugby league heartlands as it's possible to get. \nUltimately though, that's entirely the point of the sport's Sin City adventure. \nTaking a game that has always struggled for attention in the crowded sporting marketplace to a city, and indeed a country, with no history or heritage in the game may, for many, seem an unusual and expensive gamble. \nStill, if you're going to take a chance there's perhaps no more fitting place on earth than Las Vegas to roll the dice.\nIt is, after all, a city well used to hosting major global sporting events like boxing, the Super Bowl and Formula One - and rugby league is now securely on that illustrious list. \nIf there were any questions about the ambition and commitment to this festival of rugby league, they were answered on Thursday evening in downtown Vegas. \nAustralia's Tamika Upton scored five tries in Australia's 90-4 thrashing of England in Las Vegas\nThe Australian National Rugby League (NRL), the driving force behind the project, turned the world-famous Freemont Street into a spectacular red carpet walkway filled with dancers, musicians, drummers and sporting celebrities to welcome the players from the eight teams involved. \nMore than 10,000 fans turned up to the event, creating a carnival atmosphere the like of which the sport has never seen before. \nMany watching on from the barriers were left open-mouthed at the scale of the welcome. \nAnd all that before a ball had even been kicked.\nSuper League may not have been here at all had it not been for the vision of Wigan Warriors chief executive Kris Radlinski. \nTwelve months ago, he reached out to the NRL to get his side involved, having watched last year's inaugural event that was limited to just Australian clubs.\n\"I never thought it'd be like this, it's bigger than I imagined,\" said Radlinski.\n\"But it's what we deserve. I want everyone at home to believe what's possible. We've been through so much as a sport, so much effort goes on behind the scenes and we're in Las Vegas - it's exciting. We should enjoy and embrace it.\"\nLike being in a washing machine - England's tough night in Vegas\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nWigan impress in Las Vegas with win over Warrington\nAt the iconic Allegiant Stadium, one of the world's most impressive sporting arenas and home to NFL side the Las Vegas Raiders, Radlinski's Wigan put on a show befitting their tag as World Club Champions, soundly beating Warrington Wolves in the event's opening match. \nEngland Women suffered a record defeat in their historic international against Australia. \nThere were victories too for Canberra Raiders and Penrith Panthers in the NRL matches.\nBut for even the most loyal travelling fans and the broader game, this was about much more than results.\n\"This is what this is all about, the opportunity to put the game in a new global territory in front of new audiences while also giving the players and the fans new experiences,\" said Rhodri Jones, the managing director of RL Commerical and one of those charged with building the English rugby league brand.\nMore than 45,000 people attended the Allegiant Stadium during the course of the four games - an increase of around 5,000 on last season's two matches\n\"I think we've grasped the opportunity with both hands, I don't think we could have done any more. \n\"Hopefully people at home have seen this has been an unbelievable event and hopefully it will be even better next year. \n\"The number of ticket sales is better than last year so that tells you that we have collectively made an impact.\"\nBut where does the game go from here? A number of English clubs have already expressed an interest in playing in next year's event, which has now been confirmed as again featuring Super League sides. \nIt is fairly easy to see why. Future options include building the World Club Challenge into the programme and expanding the number of games.\nBut while this has all undoubtedly been an exciting new departure for the fans already engaged in the sport, what impact this will all have on rugby league's future as a truly global sport remains unclear. \nWhat is certain is that rugby league has entered a bold new era.\nWigan fans travelled to Las Vegas to watch their team beat Warrington\nWarrington half-back George Williams walks down the red carpet as he is introduced to fans",

Jodie Cunningham said it was evidence of the work English women's rugby league still has to do.\nEngland's experience in Las Vegas could hardly have been more chastening. A 90-4 defeat by Australia was the biggest the Lionesses - either as England or Great Britain - have ever suffered.\nBoth captain Cunningham and centre Hardcastle, interviewed on the pitch moments after a shattering result, were quick to pinpoint the reasons for it: they couldn't get enough of the ball, and so ended up spending much of the 70 minutes trying to defend against the best team in the world.\nHow to use that as a learning experience to avoid a repeat is a tougher question - and one that goes to the heart of the structure of women's rugby league in England.\nThe effort from Stuart Barrow's team never wavered, even as hopes of running their opponents close were shredded. The fact they scored the final try of the match, having conceded 17 before that, spoke volumes of their capacity to keep going.\nThat, in itself, required huge reserves of character.\n\"I think we know what we need to do when we go back home,\" Hardcastle said. \"You can't take anything away from the Jillaroos. \n\"They're absolute athletes and what they get to do in Australia, and how professional they are, and the backing that they get is incredible. And to face them at a top level, it's a privilege to be here.\n\"We've lost, but to be able to be here and give it a go and know what it's like in that battle, in that washing machine, it's been worth that 70 minutes.\"\nThe size of the defeat clearly hurt.\n\"There are always positives to take,\" Cunningham said. \"Right now, it's tough to focus on them, but I think the heart was there, the effort was there, we didn't give up. \n\"I think Georgia Roche getting a try for us right at the end shows that we didn't give up. The effort was there. It was just that they were too good for us. \n\"But I'm proud of the girls. I'm proud of how they kept going and sometimes that's what you've got to take at international rugby.\"\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nAustralia score 90 points against England in Las Vegas - as it happened\nJodie Cunningham acknowledged England did not have enough of the ball against Australia\nIn an interview with Sky Sports before the match, Cunningham had highlighted the gulf in investment between the women's domestic game in Australia and England.\nShe had pointed out how the players in the NRL Women's Premiership (NRLW) were either full-time or semi-professional, while those in England's Women's Super League play for expenses or nothing at all.\nThat gulf was on show at the Allegiant Stadium, as a ruthless Australia side kept on punishing their opponents.\nAnd it provided a significant reality check as England start building towards next year's World Cup.\n\"It shows where women's rugby league's at,\" Cunningham said. \"The growth that's happened over recent years, the investment that's gone into the NRLW is there to see, with the athletes they have and what you can see on show today. \n\"We've got a lot of work to do. But we've got a great squad, we've got a great group of staff and we're willing to put that hard work in to get better.\"\nIn a recent interview with BBC Sport, former Great Britain head coach Jackie Sheldon highlighted the investment Australia have put into their women's game over the past two decades as a key factor in their international dominance - they have won the past three World Cups, and lost just once since 2016.\nShe suggested England have to find a way to compete physically with Australia and New Zealand in order to be able to challenge them.\nGiven the disparity in investment between the domestic game in England and Australia, that may not be a quick process. It may be helped, though, by the experience gained by English players who have moved to the NRLW: Roche plays her club rugby for Newcastle Knights, and Hollie-Mae Dodd for Canberra Raiders, while Paige Travis will start the coming season with Parramatta Eels, having switched from St Helens.\nPerhaps, in time, the painful memories of Vegas will make England better too. As Hardcastle put it: \"The result's hard, but there's a lot we can look at individually, and think: what do we need to do to be better?\"",

        "article_text": "The World Handicapping System has proved a great talking point in golf clubs across the country\nEavesdrop many a conversation in a golf clubhouse and one could be forgiven for believing that the recreational game is being ruined.\nAt the heart of the complaints is the handicapping system, the mechanism by which varying standards of players compete against each other on level terms.\nBy rating players' abilities, golf has always prided itself on providing a way for the humblest hacker to play against the most proficient of players; with both enjoying a decent contest.\nA little over four years ago a new global scheme, the World Handicapping System (WHS), was introduced. It has proved controversial and, anecdotally, the perception is that it has been a retrograde step.\nWhile the aim was to create an accurate reflection of a golfer's ability to take on any course in the world, many players believe the system is easy to abuse for those wanting to fuel their egos with a low handicap or for those desiring a higher one to be more competitive.\nBut is that a true reflection of how it is or a myth?  Certainly, there is a different view among those who administer the WHS, compared with those grumbling over a post round pint.\nEx-motorcycle gang member reaches Open with win\n67 million to one - Whitnell hits two holes-in-one\nBoom or bust? Golf in flux but is it really thriving?\nIt is an issue that affects millions of golfers across the world and England Golf, the UK's biggest federation, believes the system is working. Furthermore, this is being reflected by the recreational game's increasing popularity.\n\"The reality was, certainly up to the launch of WHS (in November 2020), that there was a decrease every year over a 10-year period with regards to people wanting to play - the numbers of people that played in competitions and then consequently, the number of people that were actually having handicaps,\" Jeremy Tomlinson, England Golf's chief executive told BBC Sport.\nUnder the old CONGU system that prevailed in Great Britain and Ireland, handicaps were effectively determined by performances predominantly in club competitions.\nNow it is easier for regular social golf to count. This includes shorter rounds over nine holes, performances in head-to-head matchplay and while playing with a partner.\nGolfers are able to submit 'general play' scores from rounds with their friends, provided they have specified before teeing off that they want their game to count for handicap purposes.\nThis means more rounds count towards determining a players ability. The best eight scores from your 20 most recent rounds are averaged to provide what is known as a handicap index.\nThis figure is then transportable to any golf course and is used to calculate how many shots you can deduct from your total score. The harder the course, the more shots you receive to reflect the level of difficulty.\nBut the system works on a level of trust. Some players want the lowest possible handicap to help make them eligible for elite amateur events while others desire a few extra shots to help them win swanky competition prizes.\nHandicaps can now be as high as 54 (previously 36) and the average in England is 19. \"The game's gone soft,\" is a regular moan among diehard members.\n\"I think we have a swathe of feeling that there are more people with an opportunity to do well in competitions than before,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"That's probably because the old system lent, we believe, a lot more to towards the lower handicapper.\n\"But of course, there are just more people who have come in.\n\"And more people are doing scores now because more people want a handicap, and then because of that, more people progress on the golfer journey and want to compete.\"\nThere are 722,000 golfers affiliated to England Golf through clubs and the number is continuing to rise. Since November 2020, 38m handicap scores have been submitted to the federation's central database, with 10m in the last year alone.\nPlayers do not have to be a member of a club to gain a handicap, and the Woodhall Spa based organisation offers it's iGolf app as a means for an ever growing number of more nomadic golfers.\n\"We've seen an increase in the number of competition scores, general play scores, 18 holes scores and nine hole scores, which is great and long may it continue,\" England Golf chief operating officer Richard Flint told BBC Sport.\nNevertheless grumbles abound and clubs are being encouraged to take action to maintain the integrity of their competitions. \"Griping is a big word, but I think that those complaining are frustrated that it is different,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"Golf has become a lot more inclusive in providing the opportunity for different people to win, and especially when their handicap is on the way down, while they're getting into golf and getting better and better.\"\nTomlinson added: \"The handicapping system is about integrity. It is more transparent than it's ever been because it is about the scores that you do. But there is a need for check and challenge.\"\nSitting next to the England Golf boss, Flint nodded agreement. He said: \"There is sometimes this thought that, oh, let's just ban the higher handicappers from competitions because they're always winning it.\n\"It's a myth. Clubs can use the terms of competition and have categories, so everyone can play the competition from an inclusivity point of view. Have a prize for the low handicaps as well as mid and high handicapper.\"\nSeveral county unions are now insisting that more scores from competitions, rather than general play, are used to calculate low handicaps when determining eligibility for elite tournaments and representative teams.\n\"We reserve the right to be able to review any handicap that has more than four general play scorecards,\" Tomlinson insisted. \"We have denied players entrance to some of our championships because they've had too many general play cards.\"\nTomlinson insists the authorities, including the R&A and United States Golf Association who brought in WHS, are keen to further the probity of the mechanism.\n\"The R&A are just about to bring out a specification within the system which will identify where they think manipulation's happening,\" he said.\n\"It's another tool that the club handicap committee can use to address that issue. It's not 100%, but it's something that will help.\n\"Ultimately, any system - if people want to manipulate it, they will. It's not the system that's at fault, it's the individuals.\"\nTomlinson believes he is presiding over a growing recreational sport that profited from the bounce golf received by being the first sport people could play after the 2020 Covid pandemic lockdown.\nAs the nation shut down, hundreds of clubs in the UK feared for their future.  Tomlinson sat in emergency meetings across all British sports. \"We were inundated with clubs saying we're going to rack and ruin,\" he recalled.\n\"Amazing. From that point onwards, people were starting to think about their health. Golf clubs became inundated with people writing to them wanting membership, wanting to have playing rights.\n\"And I promise you that the back four weeks of that initial lockdown, I went to those meetings and I hardly said a word because I was watching in my sport compared to sports like swimming, athletics, even cricket that were suffering immeasurably because they weren't able to open up their facilities.\n\"We were building something, and by 13 May when we came out of that lockdown, we'd almost got to zero with regard to our concerns up and down the country because almost every golf club was reporting in that they were filling up.\n\"And of course, by the end of that year, they were pretty much full with waiting lists. That's what happened to golf from from the pandemic.\"\nTomlinson believes his sport, at a recreational level, has been left far healthier as a result. More people are playing at every level, whether on traditional courses or at driving ranges, in simulators or at crazy golf courses.\nHe wants to exploit this enthusiasm to grow the sport by creating pathways from these fringe versions to actual courses, club memberships and handicap competitions.\nDespite anecdotal grumblings, the figures stack up to suggest such movement is occurring. \"And that's brilliant,\" he said.\n\"And to those crusty old golfers; we still love them. We still want to take care of them, but we need them to be a bit more progressive in their thinking.\"",

        "article_text": "The uncertain future of two killer whales is no closer to being resolved despite the closure of their marine zoo home two months ago.\nWikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo are still being kept at Marineland Antibes, located in southern France, after it closed in January due to a forthcoming law banning the use of orcas in shows. \nFor months managers at Marineland have tried to send the killer whales to other marine zoos but this has angered animal rights campaigners who want them housed in a sanctuary, where the orcas won't have to perform or be used for breeding.\nThe orcas were expected to go to another marine zoo in Spain when the French government rejected a move to a proposed sanctuary in Canada a few weeks ago.\nBut now Agne\u0300s Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said she would speak to colleagues in Spain, Italy and Greece about creating a different sanctuary together. However, her proposal has few other details and has been criticised.\nThe ecology ministry, when asked by the BBC, had no further information on where a sanctuary might be located or who would fund its construction and running costs.\nLoro Parque, a marine zoo in Spain that wants to receive the killer whales from Marineland, told the BBC this week the current proposal was \"wholly unsuitable\" and that they were best positioned to care for them.\nChristoph Kiessling, vice-president of the facility in Tenerife, said whale sanctuaries were \"currently unable to meet the complex physiological, social and environmental needs\" of killer whales.\nMost designs involve cordoning off a bay and employing staff to ensure Wikie and Keijo - who were born in captivity and cannot be released into the wild - were properly fed and looked after.\nKiessling did say such a solution might be possible if there was more extensive research and planning but \"such a process could take years, leaving the two Marineland [orcas] in a facility that is being wound down\".\nCampaigners point out that several orcas have died at Loro Parque in the last few years, including three between March 2021 and September 2022.\nManagers at the marine zoo said scientific examination of those orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria showed the deaths were unavoidable.\nThey also fear Wikie might be used for breeding. Loro Parque announced in January that Morgan, the only female of the three orcas currently kept there, is pregnant.\nKatheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection, said Loro Parque was ultimately an entertainment business that used orcas to make money.\nShe added: \"Morgan's pregnancy underlines the fact that Loro Parque could never be a suitable option for Wikie and Keijo and should be removed as an option.\"\nMarineland, who are still paying to look after the orcas, said a move to Loro Parque as soon as possible was in the best interests of the animals' welfare. They have asked the ecology ministry to approve the transfer.\nThe whale sanctuary in Canada applied to the French government to take in the orcas last year but their bid was rejected in January.\nThey were told the site they had selected in Nova Scotia was too far away and that the water there was too cold for Wikie and Keijo, who have spent their whole lives in southern France.\nFollowing Pannier-Runacher's proposal for a sanctuary in Europe, which she announced a fortnight ago in a video on Instagram, the directors of the rejected Canadian project criticised the idea of one being built in the Mediterranean.\nThey wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland. These two orcas do not belong to the ecotypes seen in the Mediterranean.\"\nHe added: \"The possibility of building a sanctuary for them in the Mediterranean is probably the worst of the possible options.\" \nThe directors also said, unlike the European proposal, their sanctuary was ready to begin construction as the design had already been finalised.\nOther animal rights groups have been more welcoming of Pannier-Runacher's announcement, saying a European sanctuary would still be better for the orcas' welfare than life in another marine zoo.\nSea Shepherd, a marine conservation society, replied to the minister on Instagram saying this was a chance to achieve what the zoo industry calls \"impossible\" - the building of an ocean sanctuary where captive orcas can enjoy the rest of their lives.\nPannier-Runacher said in her video she was keenly aware of the strong feelings people had about where Wikie and Keijo should be rehomed.\nShe did not rule out sending them to Loro Parque or other marine zoos, only that she would \"oppose any transfer to a site that is not suitable for accommodating\" orcas.\nLast November she blocked an application by Marineland to send the killer whales to a marine zoo in Japan, citing lower animal welfare regulations in the country.\nThe 'Year of the Sea' is currently underway in France, a government initiative to raise awareness about the importance of the ocean, and Pannier-Runacher believes the creation of a European whale sanctuary would be a fitting testament to it.\n\"I'm not telling you that it will work,\" she told Instagram users. \"But nothing ventured, nothing gained.\"",

        "article_text": "Stars, film fans and fashionistas rejoice as the biggest night in the showbiz calendar is here at last - the 97th Oscars.\nSpanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez leads the way with 13 nominations, but recently saw its awards chances damaged after offensive historic tweets from its star resurfaced.\nWicked, The Brutalist, Conclave and Anora are also among the top contenders, with the race for best picture too close to call.\nUS comedian Conan O'Brien is presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT).\nYou can also expect plenty of references during the night to the wildfires which devastated LA and left thousands of homes destroyed.\nHere are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).\nIt is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken. \nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).\nHowever, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.\nChasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.\nWicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.\nMeanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.\nAll the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nThe film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.\nBut there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.\nThis has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.\nIn the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.\nBut it's a tight race.\nThere were gasps backstage at the Baftas (where I was) when Anora star Mikey Madison scooped up the best actress prize.\nIt was a big blow to the assumed Oscar momentum for Moore, and an incredible moment for Madison, who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nBest actor may also be up in the air. Adrian Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.\nLast week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.\nIf he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.\nIn the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.\nIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.\nThis year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.\nIn fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.\nElsewhere, however, progress remains slow.\nCoralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five.\n\"Has there been progress, yes. Has there been enough? Absolutely not,\" April Reign, LA-based founder of the #OscarsSoWhite movement, told me.\n\"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough. It was also about gender, age, class, sexuality and geography too.\"\n\"If we're still able to count them on one hand, then we're not there yet.\"\nMost of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet \u2013 I'm already betting we'll see more tears and hand holding from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\nThere had been a big question mark over whether Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n will show up after the row over her past tweets.\nHowever, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.\nPresenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.\nThe nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.\nThere's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.\nCancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.\nShe told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.\n\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.\nThis year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.\nInstead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.\nI can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nDoja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.\nThe Academy Awards ceremony is hosted this year for the first time by comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien.\nHe replaces US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel, who has presented the show four times including last year.\nThe 2025 Oscars will air live on Sunday 2 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002.\nThe show can be watched in the US on ABC and can be streamed on Hulu. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.\nUK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.\nCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.\nIf she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.\nRalph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.\nElsewhere, Felicity Jones is nominated for best supporting actress for The Brutalist - a decade after her first Oscar nomination - while Sir Elton John is in the best original song race.\nThe country will also be rooting for two more screen legends - Wallace and Gromit (and their makers Aardman Animations), who are hoping for their fourth Oscar. They are shortlisted for best animated feature for their latest outing, Vengeance Most Fowl.\nRead more about this year's awards season films:",

How to watch the Oscars and who is nominated8 hours agoShareSaveNoor NanjiCulture reporter in Los Angeles\u2022@NoorNanjiShareSaveGetty ImagesMikey Madison and Demi Moore are both up for best actressStars, film fans and fashionistas rejoice as the biggest night in the showbiz calendar is here at last - the 97th Oscars.Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez leads the way with 13 nominations, but recently saw its awards chances damaged after offensive historic tweets from its star resurfaced.Wicked, The Brutalist, Conclave and Anora are also among the top contenders, with the race for best picture too close to call.US comedian Conan O'Brien is presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT).You can also expect plenty of references during the night to the wildfires which devastated LA and left thousands of homes destroyed.Here are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.Which films are in the running?NetflixEmilia P\u00e9rez, starring Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, has the most nominations this yearEmilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).It is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. Adrian Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.Last week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.In the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.10 years since #OscarsSoWhiteIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.This year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.In fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.Elsewhere, however, progress remains slow.Coralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.UK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.British buzzGetty ImagesConclave's Ralph Fiennes has his first best actor nomination for 28 yearsCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.If she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.Ralph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. \"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough.",

        "article_text": "Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.\nLocated in Prince George's County, Maryland - one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US - the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.  \nAlthough it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with \"black excellence\", locals told the BBC.\nTo live there, Patricia Gafford says: \"You've got to have money \u2013 lots of it.\"\nThough Mrs Gafford is a dues-paying member of the private country club where she often plays golf, the 73-year-old says she does not live inside the gated community, because, as her husband once told her, \"'it's a little bit too rich for us'\".\nThe setting has also inspired a ground-breaking new soap opera called Beyond the Gates; its second week of programming begins on Monday. Beyond the Gates is the first new daytime soap opera on network TV in over two decades and the first hour-long daytime soap with a predominantly black cast on network TV.\nKristen Warner, an associate professor of performing and media arts at Cornell University, says seeing its release feels long overdue.\n\"Black folks have been huge supporters and viewers of soap operas since its inception,\" she told the BBC.\nYet with over 90 years of soap opera history, there has \"never\" been a black family as the main family from the start of the show, she explains.\nShe says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of \"elegance and glamour and style and fashion\", as well as the trademark \"messiness\" of the day-time plot lines.\nThe show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centres on the Dupree family. While its daily drama-filled plot lines are sure to be, in classic soap opera fashion, over-the-top, the setting was inspired by the very real exclusive enclave inside Prince George's County. \nThe long winding road that leads up to the Country Club at Woodmore is lined with big brick houses built like castles, and surrounded by expansive manicured lawns. A Maserati, Mercedes Benz or something similar decorates most driveways.\nThe depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.\n\"It was kind of like a culture shock for me to see black people with like these mega houses,\" Ms Balgar says. \nIn Woodmore, where census estimates say over 80% of the population is black, the average median household income is over $214,000 (\u00a3170,091). The average in the US is just over $80,000.\nMs Balgar too plays golf on Woodmore's course, where she occasionally hosts events for her women-of-colour centred social club, City Girls Golf. \nShe says Beyond the Gates has been \"all over social\" media and that \"everyone is excited\" about how it's putting a spotlight on a little-known hub of black affluence.\nLong before it was an axis for Washington DC's black elite, in the 1800s, Prince George's County was once known to house the most enslaved African Americans in all of Maryland, says Susan Pearl, a historian at Prince George's County Historical Society.\nOne of the largest plantations in the area, Pleasant Prospect, was located where Woodmore's gated community now stands. The street leading into Woodmore's gates carries the same name.\n\"Some of these wealthy, successful black families are living on land where hundreds of enslaved people were working for one large white property owner,\" says Ms Pearl.\nThe county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after \"a wave of violence\" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.\nBlack Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.\nThe area soon became known for its affluence.\nAt the time, the federal government, which employs many people in nearby Washington, DC, was one of the first to implement anti-discrimination policies, giving black Americans a rare chance at better opportunities and better pay.\nFederal jobs \"played a huge role\" in creating black economic success, Ms Davis says, leading to Prince George's County eventually becoming the wealthiest majority-black county in the US.\nBy the late 80s, \"McMansions\" owned by black families began popping up, she added.\nMeanwhile, the county's white population continued to decline as large numbers of white residents began leaving the District of Columbia area in a phenomenon called \"white flight\".\nYet it wasn't until 1992 that the Country Club at Woodmore admitted its first black member - nearly 70 years after the club first opened, in 1923. He died last year.\nThe history-making Beyond the Gates arrives at a \"strange time\", media professor Ms Warner says: \"The soap opera is nearly extinct.\"\nFor most of soap opera history, she explains, black characters were secondary to the story, introduced through the lives of white families, initially in roles like housekeeper, then later as cops and lawyers.\nNBC soap opera Generations made history in 1989 when it became the first to feature a black family from the beginning, but this will be the first soap to make a black family the star of the central plot.\nThe soap is also airing amid a backlash - spearheaded by President Donald Trump's administration - against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\nBeyond the Gates was born out of a collaboration between CBS and the NAACP in 2020, following the social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a gesture of \"goodwill\" that Ms Warner says is now being \"rolled back\".\n\"In the midst of everything being taken away, we have this one little moment where there is something there for us,\" Ms Warner says, referring to the soap.\nThe club's black members say that despite a shifting political climate, Woodmore - with its rolling hills and towering pine trees - remains a safe, familiar space. \n\"When I come onto the grounds, I see people who look like me,\" says Mrs Gafford, a member.\n\"It's great to come in and see Brent (Taliaferro) behind the counter,\" she adds, referencing the club's assistant golf pro, who is also black. \n\"We all feel like we're one big family - the Woodmore family,\" he agrees. \nThere are few people at Woodmore's club Mr Taliaferro doesn't know, including Hope Wiseman, who grew up inside the gates of Woodmore.\nShe believes the name of the new soap opera is aptly titled.\n\"Everybody wants to be behind the gates, so it's funny they called it Beyond the Gates. Everybody wants to see kind of what's back there,\" Ms Wiseman says.\nShe opened a cannabis dispensary down the road in 2018, making her the youngest black woman at the time to own one.\nIt's success stories like these and people like Ms Wisemen - black entrepreneurs and black dentists, like her mom - that aren't on TV screens enough, she says.\nThat's why Ms Wiseman says she is pleased to see this new soap opera depicting her community.\n\"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to grow up around and operate in an environment where there's black excellence all around you,\" she says.\n\"That's not the experience of most of black America. That's exciting to see on TV.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nSuperb Wigan thrash Warrington in Las Vegas\nLas Vegas, a city built around extravagance and opulence, with the blinking bright lights of giant electric billboards, garish neon signs and enormous flashing video screens, feels about as far away from the traditional northern England rugby league heartlands as it's possible to get. \nUltimately though, that's entirely the point of the sport's Sin City adventure. \nTaking a game that has always struggled for attention in the crowded sporting marketplace to a city, and indeed a country, with no history or heritage in the game may, for many, seem an unusual and expensive gamble. \nStill, if you're going to take a chance there's perhaps no more fitting place on earth than Las Vegas to roll the dice.\nIt is, after all, a city well used to hosting major global sporting events like boxing, the Super Bowl and Formula One - and rugby league is now securely on that illustrious list. \nIf there were any questions about the ambition and commitment to this festival of rugby league, they were answered on Thursday evening in downtown Vegas. \nAustralia's Tamika Upton scored five tries in Australia's 90-4 thrashing of England in Las Vegas\nThe Australian National Rugby League (NRL), the driving force behind the project, turned the world-famous Freemont Street into a spectacular red carpet walkway filled with dancers, musicians, drummers and sporting celebrities to welcome the players from the eight teams involved. \nMore than 10,000 fans turned up to the event, creating a carnival atmosphere the like of which the sport has never seen before. \nMany watching on from the barriers were left open-mouthed at the scale of the welcome. \nAnd all that before a ball had even been kicked.\nSuper League may not have been here at all had it not been for the vision of Wigan Warriors chief executive Kris Radlinski. \nTwelve months ago, he reached out to the NRL to get his side involved, having watched last year's inaugural event that was limited to just Australian clubs.\n\"I never thought it'd be like this, it's bigger than I imagined,\" said Radlinski.\n\"But it's what we deserve. I want everyone at home to believe what's possible. We've been through so much as a sport, so much effort goes on behind the scenes and we're in Las Vegas - it's exciting. We should enjoy and embrace it.\"\nLike being in a washing machine - England's tough night in Vegas\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nWigan impress in Las Vegas with win over Warrington\nAt the iconic Allegiant Stadium, one of the world's most impressive sporting arenas and home to NFL side the Las Vegas Raiders, Radlinski's Wigan put on a show befitting their tag as World Club Champions, soundly beating Warrington Wolves in the event's opening match. \nEngland Women suffered a record defeat in their historic international against Australia. \nThere were victories too for Canberra Raiders and Penrith Panthers in the NRL matches.\nBut for even the most loyal travelling fans and the broader game, this was about much more than results.\n\"This is what this is all about, the opportunity to put the game in a new global territory in front of new audiences while also giving the players and the fans new experiences,\" said Rhodri Jones, the managing director of RL Commerical and one of those charged with building the English rugby league brand.\nMore than 45,000 people attended the Allegiant Stadium during the course of the four games - an increase of around 5,000 on last season's two matches\n\"I think we've grasped the opportunity with both hands, I don't think we could have done any more. \n\"Hopefully people at home have seen this has been an unbelievable event and hopefully it will be even better next year. \n\"The number of ticket sales is better than last year so that tells you that we have collectively made an impact.\"\nBut where does the game go from here? A number of English clubs have already expressed an interest in playing in next year's event, which has now been confirmed as again featuring Super League sides. \nIt is fairly easy to see why. Future options include building the World Club Challenge into the programme and expanding the number of games.\nBut while this has all undoubtedly been an exciting new departure for the fans already engaged in the sport, what impact this will all have on rugby league's future as a truly global sport remains unclear. \nWhat is certain is that rugby league has entered a bold new era.\nWigan fans travelled to Las Vegas to watch their team beat Warrington\nWarrington half-back George Williams walks down the red carpet as he is introduced to fans",

        "article_text": "Many of the stars of Toxic Town had not heard of the scandal the drama is based on, but are hoping the Netflix retelling will bring it into the spotlight.\nThe show follows the real-life battle of families in Corby, Northamptonshire, whose children were born with defects in the 1980s and 90s.\nIn court it was argued that toxic airborne pollutants from the town's demolished steelworks had harmed unborn babies.\nActor Brendan Coyle, who was born in Corby, admitted he had been unaware of the story, but said there was excitement in his hometown to see it told to the world.\n\"One of the mothers has been in touch... It's kind of the talk of the town. People are excited about it,\" he said.\n\"For them, the mothers and these children, to have their story told... it's amazing. It's something that's been buried for a long time in terms of people's perception.\"\nIn the drama, the Downton Abbey star plays Roy Thomas, a fictional Corby borough councillor.\nThe 62-year-old actor explained that, like many in the town, his family had moved from Scotland to work at the Corby Steelworks, which in 1979, just before its closure, had about 10,000 employees.\n\"When I was born in Corby, 80% of the population of that town had been born in Scotland,\" he said.\n\"My granny and granddad came down from Bellshill, which is a mining community outside Glasgow. They never lost their accent because you're in amongst it, you know?\"\n\nMembers of his family, including his brother, still live and work in the area.\n\"My brother asked 'Is there any craic in this?'\" he laughed.\n\"On the surface it's very bleak... but in the documentary [the Horizon programme on the case] you see the women they talk to and there's great spirit and humour and great craic.\n\"I think Jack [Thorne, writer of the drama] has captured that brilliantly.\"\nFor executive producer Annabel Jones, humour was an important part of the storytelling.\nShe said: \"Corby is known for its sense of humour; known for its warmth. I wanted to make sure that comes across through the characters as well, because I want it to feel true to Corby.\n\"I didn't want it to feel that people didn't have a sense of hope at that time.\"\nThe Emmy and Bafta-winning Welsh producer first heard about the scandal while in lockdown during the pandemic.\nA friend, from Corby, told her about the case while they were on a masked-up walk in a park.\nShe recalled: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked that, firstly, I have never heard of this story, and secondly, why have I never heard of this story?\n\"This really needs to be pulled into the public consciousness; we need to be made aware so things like this don't happen again.\"\nFrom that point, the 53-year-old began speaking to as many people involved in the case as possible to ensure their stories were told story accurately.\nOne of the nuances of the adaptation is the Corby accent, which Coyle compared to a \"diluted\" Scottish accent.\nHe said: \"It's an odd one but I can recognise it anywhere. I've been on a tube before and been like 'Are you from Corby?' There is nothing like it.\"\nThe executive producer added: \"It's such a particular accent because obviously Corby has lots of different influences... We did work with lots of accent coaches to try and perfect it.\n\"Jodie Whittaker really worked hard. It was probably the thing she was most nervous about. When she met with Susan she very kindly reassured her and told her she'd done a good job.\"\nOther members of the cast met or emailed the people they played to help craft their performance.\nHowever, this was not an option for Robert Carlyle. The man he portrayed, Corby borough councillor Sam Hagen, died in October 2022, a year before filming began.\nTo help, the production team sourced hours of video footage in which the real-life politician told his story.\nCarlyle, who starred in The Full Monty, said: \"He's got a straight kind of voice; a slightly higher kind of Glasgow man that talks like that... I thought... 'That just sounds like my dad.'\n\"I thought 'There's elements here of my dad in Sam' and that was my way in.\"\nThe Trainspotting actor described his character as \"a hero with a small h\" who \"fundamentally wants Corby to succeed\".\nCarlyle said: \"He was determined to make the best of his life down there to try and regenerate this town. He's the kind of man who made sure the traffic lights are working correctly and there's a zebra crossing in the right place.\n\"He does the right thing. It's lovely; a lot of my characters aren't like that. It's nice to have a chance to play somebody who is inherently good.\"\nCastmate Rory Kinnear, who played solicitor Des Collins, explained the show never made a judgement on any of the characters, one way or the other \n\"Everyone believes they're doing the right thing,\" he said.\n\"It allows an audience to decide whether they think those people did do the right things at the right time for the right reason.\"\nKinnear did not speak to the real-life lawyer while preparing for the role.\nHe said: \"The choice of casting me means they were taking it in a slightly different way. I knew they were creating a version of Des in terms of age; in terms of look; in terms of lots of other things\"\nThe real Des Collins, however, thought the Bond actor's portrayal was very close to the truth: \"He got me down to a tee. He was more me than I am,\" he said.\n\"I ended up on a couple of occasions, having seen it, saying 'Oh, I wish said that' and then I realised it wasn't me doing it, it was Rory Kinnear pretending to be me.\"\nThe actor hopes the drama will get people talking. \"As the sibling of a disabled person myself, one is well aware that they are not at the forefront of public interest,\" he said.\n\"What excites me about this is, not just the story itself, but the fact Netflix are doing it and it's a departure for them to do a four-part series like this of this subject matter.\n\"You could well imagine this being on late on BBC2 or Channel 4, and 250,000 loved it and watched it, but it doesn't have any impact.\n\"I think Netflix's ambition with it is to make sure it's something everybody watches, talks about and is made aware of.\"\nBBC Radio Northampton has produced an eight-part documentary series called In Detail: The Toxic Waste Scandal, which will be available for download on 4 March.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

I don't know how long it will take. We have a goal and we continue forward no matter what.\"\nWorking as a pundit for Match of the Day, Rooney's reaction to those comments was that Amorim should focus more on short-term aims that might keep him in his job.\n\"I think it's a little naive to say they're looking to win the Premier League because from where they are now, they're a long way off that,\" he said.\n\"I think he'll get time but it's not a free hit because he'll expect more from Manchester United than what we're seeing since he's been in.

But, from personal experience, he knows talking about a team and managing one is two entirely different things.\n\"That (winning the Premier League) is the goal,\" said Amorim. \"To be naive is to think we are going to do it this season or be the best contender next season.\n\"I know in this moment, everybody knows everything. I was a pundit when I finished my [playing] career. I know it's really easy.\n\"Maybe it is not with me but our goal, as a club, is to win the Premier League like we did in the past with all the great glories and legends of this club.\n\"We are in a difficult moment.

Ages like a fine wine. A happy fighter is a dangerous fighter. Natasha Jonas' career lends itself to plenty of overused boxing cliches.\nA pioneer of women's boxing for more than a decade, the 40-year-old headlines an all-female card at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall on Friday.\nJonas will put her WBC and IBF welterweight titles on the line against Wales' WBA champion Lauren Price.\nPrice, 30, is the unbeaten Olympic golden girl brimming with confidence. To use another stock sporting phrase, she predicts a passing of the torch.\nLet's not write Liverpool's history-maker off just yet, though.\nToxteth-born Jonas was the first British female to ever box at an Olympic Games. She has overcome injuries, disappointing defeats and juggled boxing with motherhood.\nThrough stellar punditry work or as the first black woman to obtain a British Boxing Board of Control manager's licence, Jonas continues to make waves outside the ring too.\nBut her life could easily have panned out very differently. Speaking to BBC Sport, Jonas reflects on the 'sliding doors' moments which led to her becoming a two-weight world champion.\nJonas v Price - All you need to know\nBelfast, New York & plenty of controversy\nJonas caught the sporting bug as a four-year-old watching the Seoul 1988 Olympics. \nAlthough her memory of those Games is somewhat patchy, she remembers \"being overwhelmed and excited by all the sport that was happening\". \nTwo decades later she was nicknamed 'Miss GB' for her own Olympic appearance.\nWhen Jonas qualified for London 2012 at an event in China, she shared a heartwarming moment with her mother. \n\"That's when Mum told me at the airport how proud she was and that when I was a little girl, watching the Olympics on TV, I told her one day I wanted to be there,\" Jonas adds.\n\"Sometimes kids have big ideas. Sometimes life and the world gets in the way. But after 24 years and trying hundreds of sports, I got there.\n\"So looking back, I could say the '88 Games was the most pivotal event of my career.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIQ, speed & accuracy - why Jonas is confident for Price bout\nAs a teenager, Jonas dreamed of representing her country on the global stage, but not as a pugilist.\n\"I watched Rachel Yankey and Mia Hamm and always thought 'I'm a well better footballer',\" she says.\nJonas is \"not the most academic\" but buckled down to earn a football scholarship at St Peter's College in New Jersey.\n\"America was the place to be,\" she says, with only a handful of English women's football teams operating at a professional level at the time. \nBut a budding football career was cut devastatingly short when Jonas tore her cruciate ligament while in the States. \n\"If my injury hadn't have happened I definitely wouldn't be getting punched in the face for a living. It was a big turning point,\" Jonas adds.\nHer sister, Nikita Parris, has 72 caps for England and was part of the 2022 Euros winning squad.\nAsked if she would swap her career for a major trophy, Jonas replies: \"I'd rather go on to become an undisputed boxing world champion than a football World Cup winner.\"\nJonas is trained by Joe Gallagher, who has trained six world champions, including Liam Smith\nWhen Jonas returned to England she lost friendship groups made through football and, with her knee in a brace, began to put on weight.\nShe briefly worked in call centres but was sacked from all seven jobs.\n\"Now looking back as an adult, I recognise that I was depressed,\" Jonas says. \"I lost my identity. Everyone said I was going to play for Liverpool and England but now I was no longer 'Tasha the footballer' but just Tasha.\"\nIn a bid to regain her fitness, Jonas, aged 21, stepped into the legendary Rotunda Amateur Boxing Gym.\n\"All the lads were like 'who is she?'. They weren't used to having a girl in their gym,\" she recalls.\n\"After a warm-up, the coach asked us to get into pairs to do bags. I thought I'd be the little girl who is last to be picked, like when I used to play football with my cousins.\"\nInstead, Jonas was greeted by the kindness of future light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith - one of the popular boys in the gym. When he saw a deflated Jonas put her head down, he offered to partner up.\n\"I don't know if I would or wouldn't have stuck it out if he hadn't done that, but one little gesture from Liam made such a difference - there was no more awkwardness in the gym after that,\" Jonas adds.\nJonas beat American Quanitta Underwood at London 2012 but missed out on a medal after losing to Katie Taylor in the quarter-finals\nJonas called time on her amateur career in 2014 with a record of 57 wins and 26 defeats. She gave birth to her daughter, Mila, and was happy to never box again.\nThat soon changed after the pro debut of a trailblazing Irishwoman and a phone call from a former Team GB team-mate.\n\"I did some punditry work for Katie Taylor's debut and Tom Stalker phoned me afterwards,\" Jonas explains.\n\"He said there will be a lot of opportunity for pro females now and asked if I'd ever think of coming back? I said 'shut up, Tom'.\"\nJonas says she was \"happy with her routine\". Mila had turned two and was in nursery and the media work was keeping her busy.\nBut Stalker's words kept ringing in her ear. After speaking to her immediate family, Jonas realised the boxing fire was still burning.\n\"I phoned two cousins, my mum and dad,\" Jonas adds. \"I trusted their judgement and they knew the good and bad side to boxing. \n\"They were there for me when I cried for two days, after losing to Katie in the amateurs. \n\"But they all gave me their support and said I had nothing to worry about, especially as far as the baby is concerned.\"\nTurning pro was a decision that paid off. In February 2022, Jonas stopped Chris Namus to become light-middleweight world champion and has since won all five world-title level fights.\n\"If I could go back and talk to myself in some of those hardest moments earlier in life, I'd say 'chin up, kid, it all works out in the end',\" she says.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "The World Handicapping System has proved a great talking point in golf clubs across the country\nEavesdrop many a conversation in a golf clubhouse and one could be forgiven for believing that the recreational game is being ruined.\nAt the heart of the complaints is the handicapping system, the mechanism by which varying standards of players compete against each other on level terms.\nBy rating players' abilities, golf has always prided itself on providing a way for the humblest hacker to play against the most proficient of players; with both enjoying a decent contest.\nA little over four years ago a new global scheme, the World Handicapping System (WHS), was introduced. It has proved controversial and, anecdotally, the perception is that it has been a retrograde step.\nWhile the aim was to create an accurate reflection of a golfer's ability to take on any course in the world, many players believe the system is easy to abuse for those wanting to fuel their egos with a low handicap or for those desiring a higher one to be more competitive.\nBut is that a true reflection of how it is or a myth?  Certainly, there is a different view among those who administer the WHS, compared with those grumbling over a post round pint.\nEx-motorcycle gang member reaches Open with win\n67 million to one - Whitnell hits two holes-in-one\nBoom or bust? Golf in flux but is it really thriving?\nIt is an issue that affects millions of golfers across the world and England Golf, the UK's biggest federation, believes the system is working. Furthermore, this is being reflected by the recreational game's increasing popularity.\n\"The reality was, certainly up to the launch of WHS (in November 2020), that there was a decrease every year over a 10-year period with regards to people wanting to play - the numbers of people that played in competitions and then consequently, the number of people that were actually having handicaps,\" Jeremy Tomlinson, England Golf's chief executive told BBC Sport.\nUnder the old CONGU system that prevailed in Great Britain and Ireland, handicaps were effectively determined by performances predominantly in club competitions.\nNow it is easier for regular social golf to count. This includes shorter rounds over nine holes, performances in head-to-head matchplay and while playing with a partner.\nGolfers are able to submit 'general play' scores from rounds with their friends, provided they have specified before teeing off that they want their game to count for handicap purposes.\nThis means more rounds count towards determining a players ability. The best eight scores from your 20 most recent rounds are averaged to provide what is known as a handicap index.\nThis figure is then transportable to any golf course and is used to calculate how many shots you can deduct from your total score. The harder the course, the more shots you receive to reflect the level of difficulty.\nBut the system works on a level of trust. Some players want the lowest possible handicap to help make them eligible for elite amateur events while others desire a few extra shots to help them win swanky competition prizes.\nHandicaps can now be as high as 54 (previously 36) and the average in England is 19. \"The game's gone soft,\" is a regular moan among diehard members.\n\"I think we have a swathe of feeling that there are more people with an opportunity to do well in competitions than before,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"That's probably because the old system lent, we believe, a lot more to towards the lower handicapper.\n\"But of course, there are just more people who have come in.\n\"And more people are doing scores now because more people want a handicap, and then because of that, more people progress on the golfer journey and want to compete.\"\nThere are 722,000 golfers affiliated to England Golf through clubs and the number is continuing to rise. Since November 2020, 38m handicap scores have been submitted to the federation's central database, with 10m in the last year alone.\nPlayers do not have to be a member of a club to gain a handicap, and the Woodhall Spa based organisation offers it's iGolf app as a means for an ever growing number of more nomadic golfers.\n\"We've seen an increase in the number of competition scores, general play scores, 18 holes scores and nine hole scores, which is great and long may it continue,\" England Golf chief operating officer Richard Flint told BBC Sport.\nNevertheless grumbles abound and clubs are being encouraged to take action to maintain the integrity of their competitions. \"Griping is a big word, but I think that those complaining are frustrated that it is different,\" Tomlinson said.\n\"Golf has become a lot more inclusive in providing the opportunity for different people to win, and especially when their handicap is on the way down, while they're getting into golf and getting better and better.\"\nTomlinson added: \"The handicapping system is about integrity. It is more transparent than it's ever been because it is about the scores that you do. But there is a need for check and challenge.\"\nSitting next to the England Golf boss, Flint nodded agreement. He said: \"There is sometimes this thought that, oh, let's just ban the higher handicappers from competitions because they're always winning it.\n\"It's a myth. Clubs can use the terms of competition and have categories, so everyone can play the competition from an inclusivity point of view. Have a prize for the low handicaps as well as mid and high handicapper.\"\nSeveral county unions are now insisting that more scores from competitions, rather than general play, are used to calculate low handicaps when determining eligibility for elite tournaments and representative teams.\n\"We reserve the right to be able to review any handicap that has more than four general play scorecards,\" Tomlinson insisted. \"We have denied players entrance to some of our championships because they've had too many general play cards.\"\nTomlinson insists the authorities, including the R&A and United States Golf Association who brought in WHS, are keen to further the probity of the mechanism.\n\"The R&A are just about to bring out a specification within the system which will identify where they think manipulation's happening,\" he said.\n\"It's another tool that the club handicap committee can use to address that issue. It's not 100%, but it's something that will help.\n\"Ultimately, any system - if people want to manipulate it, they will. It's not the system that's at fault, it's the individuals.\"\nTomlinson believes he is presiding over a growing recreational sport that profited from the bounce golf received by being the first sport people could play after the 2020 Covid pandemic lockdown.\nAs the nation shut down, hundreds of clubs in the UK feared for their future.  Tomlinson sat in emergency meetings across all British sports. \"We were inundated with clubs saying we're going to rack and ruin,\" he recalled.\n\"Amazing. From that point onwards, people were starting to think about their health. Golf clubs became inundated with people writing to them wanting membership, wanting to have playing rights.\n\"And I promise you that the back four weeks of that initial lockdown, I went to those meetings and I hardly said a word because I was watching in my sport compared to sports like swimming, athletics, even cricket that were suffering immeasurably because they weren't able to open up their facilities.\n\"We were building something, and by 13 May when we came out of that lockdown, we'd almost got to zero with regard to our concerns up and down the country because almost every golf club was reporting in that they were filling up.\n\"And of course, by the end of that year, they were pretty much full with waiting lists. That's what happened to golf from from the pandemic.\"\nTomlinson believes his sport, at a recreational level, has been left far healthier as a result. More people are playing at every level, whether on traditional courses or at driving ranges, in simulators or at crazy golf courses.\nHe wants to exploit this enthusiasm to grow the sport by creating pathways from these fringe versions to actual courses, club memberships and handicap competitions.\nDespite anecdotal grumblings, the figures stack up to suggest such movement is occurring. \"And that's brilliant,\" he said.\n\"And to those crusty old golfers; we still love them. We still want to take care of them, but we need them to be a bit more progressive in their thinking.\"",

        "article_text": "Douglas Adams's epic series of comic novels, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, is loved by scientists and tech executives, including Elon Musk. In 1986, the author talked to the BBC about the unlikely origins of a wildly successful multimedia franchise.\nImagine waking up on what seems to be an ordinary morning on planet Earth, only to find out that the planet is scheduled to be demolished. That is where British writer Douglas Adams begins The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Over the next few decades, the story would take on a life of its own, spinning out into a sprawling franchise that now includes a bestselling book series, a television series, a feature film, stage shows, comic books and even a video game. It would also spark endless philosophical debates about the universe, and leave an indelible mark on pop culture. And it all began as a small BBC radio comedy.\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy revolves around the misadventures of Arthur Dent, an ordinary man from a sleepy English village who finds out that some bureaucratic aliens are about to obliterate the Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Dent and his friend, an alien-in-disguise named Ford Prefect, hitch a ride on a spaceship to escape the planet's destruction. Together with a motley crew comprising a two-headed space president, another Earth survivor and a depressed robot, they engage in hijinks across the galaxy while collecting research for an interplanetary encyclopedia, the eponymous Hitchhiker's Guide.\nWhile the story encompasses scientific intricacies and complex ideological layers, the idea of Hitchhiker's came to Adams in 1971 while he was \"lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck\", he told Terry Wogan on the latter's BBC chat show in 1986. Inebriated beneath the swirling stars, clutching a copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to Europe, Adams decided that someone should devise a similar guidebook to the whole of the Milky Way.\nBy 1977, Adams had written for several radio shows, and was given the chance to pitch his own to the BBC. His first idea was for a six-episode anthology called The Ends of the Earth, in which each episode would have the Earth ending in a different way. Adams would eventually return to the idea of the guide as the story's focus. \"I never actually thought of myself as a science-fiction writer,\" he told Wogan. \"I thought myself primarily a comedy writer, and I became a science-fiction writer simply because I exaggerated so much.\"\nHitchhiker was the first radio comedy programme produced in stereo instead of in front of a live studio audience. The project was briefly listed as a radio drama, as the BBC only allowed dramas to be recorded in stereo. \"[Adams] knew the music, he knew the sound he wanted, he knew what the end of the world was going to sound like,\" producer Simon Brett told BBC Bookclub in 2000. Adams and Brett cast actors Simon Jones and Geoffrey McGivern as Dent and Prefect, with Peter Jones narrating the part of \"The Book\".\nThe programme was quietly launched late on a Wednesday night in March 1978, and received mixed reviews. One listener complained to the Radio Times, calling the episode \"fatuous, inane, childish, pointless, codswalloping drivel\". But it was also praised for its fascinating concept and its innovative and \"richly textured\" music and effects.\nBBC Enterprises turned down the chance to publish a novel based on the series, but Nick Webb, who was an editor at Pan Books, commissioned Adams to adapt his story. \"I thought [Hitchhiker's] was verbally witty and dexterous, and full of philosophical jokes \u2013 and I'm a sucker for philosophical jokes \u2013 but he had also a trick of sort of extrapolating something in a completely rational way, to a point of madness,\" Webb told BBC Bookclub. \"Then you would scratch your head and scratch your bum and think, 'Well, what exactly is the intellectual trick that has been played upon you?' Because inference-by-inference everything makes sense, but you get to a point of surreal absurdity.\"\nUltimately, Adams would write five Hitchhiker's books, along with two radio series and a television show. The franchise built a cult following \u2013 although its fans weren't always open about loving what was seen in the 1980s as an unfashionably geeky genre. \"People never like to admit it, actually,\" said Adams. \"Whenever I do book signing sessions\u2026 men come along and say, 'Would you sign this please, it's for my little boy?' And then you'd get little boys come along and say, 'Would you sign this please, it's for my father?'\"\nNonetheless, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy now has devotees all around the world, and the book has been translated into more than 30 languages. Dedicated fans celebrate Towel Day annually on 25 May as a tribute to Adams, who wrote: \"A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.\" In 1999, he founded a community forum called h2g2, also known as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition, where people could contribute entries to a real-time collection of titbits and vignettes about life on Earth.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nSome fans are drawn to Hitchhiker's particularly for its philosophical insights and applications to future technologies. Google's artificial intelligence research laboratory DeepMind was named in homage to Adams's Deep Thought, a supercomputer that, in the story, calculates the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. One of the series' best jokes is how unhelpful the answer is: it's the number 42.\nTesla founder Elon Musk has not been shy about his adoration for Adams, calling the writer the \"best philosopher ever\" and noting the story is \"so deep that people don't even understand\". The book helped the tech figure through an existential crisis as a teenager, he told journalist Alison van Diggelen in 2013. \"It highlighted an important point, which is that a lot of times the question is harder than the answer,\" he said. The story fuelled Musk's lofty ambitions for humanity's multiplanetary future, and in 2018 he launched a Tesla car into space with a copy of the novel in the glove compartment, and a sign on the dashboard featuring one of its key phrases: \"Don't panic!\" However, critics have argued that Musk misunderstands Adams' work, with Harvard historian Jill Lepore writing in The New Yorker that Hitchhiker's is a \"razor-sharp satiric indictment of imperialism\".\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Russia launched a giant space mirror\n\u2022 The classic novel rescued from the reject pile\n\u2022 The WW1 trauma that inspired The Lord of the Rings\nIn 2001, Adams died of a heart attack at the age of 49. At the time, he was working on the script for the first feature-length film of his story, which would be released posthumously in 2005. After Adams's death, the BBC commissioned four more series of the Hitchhiker's radio series. In 2009, author Eoin Colfer, with the support of Adams's estate, went on to pen a sixth book in the series, And Another Thing\u2026\nThe spirit of Adams's space comedy lives on in other forms of popular culture. Such motifs as the number 42 and \"Don't Panic\" can be found in various science-fiction works, including Doctor Who, Star Trek, Lost and The X-Files. The Hitchhiker's spirit lives on in technology, too, as Adams's fictional inventions continue to crop up in the real world. \"I'm not particularly worried about whether something you invent is actually going to happen or whatever,\" he said. \"I'm making fun of the people who are then going to use it.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Connolly at least gives captain Steve Smith another option with his left-arm spin.Smith will be heavily reliant on his leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who has dismissed Rohit four times in ODIs, Virat Kohli five and both Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul on four occasions.India's spin strength also means their death bowling is yet to be tested in this tournament, where they are without the great Jasprit Bumrah because of injury.In Bumrah's absence, the role will fall to Mohammed Shami and Hardik, if Australia can be the first team to take them deep.Shami has gone at 8.12 runs per over in the final 10 overs of ODIs since the start of 2022, putting him among the more expensive finishing bowlers in the world, while Hardik is one of 11 bowlers to concede more than 10.9 runs per over at the death in recent Indian Premier Leagues.Are Proteas best suited to beating India?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Champions Trophy highlights: South Africa v EnglandAustralia will train at the Dubai International Stadium \u2013 the location of their 2021 World Cup win \u2013 on Monday night, ensuring their decision to depart Pakistan on Saturday despite not knowing if they would play there was not wasted.South Africa, who flew in on Sunday in a similar scenario, were not so fortunate and returned to Pakistan on the three-hour flight on Monday morning, less than 24 hours after arriving.The second semi-final will be a repeat of a match won by New Zealand, also at Gaddafi Stadium just 21 days ago.On that occasion, Mitchell Santner's side chased 305 with eight balls to spare but South Africa's weakened line-up, due to the conclusion of the SA20, has been reinforced since.New Zealand were too tentative early in their chase against India on Sunday and will hope to earn a second shot at beating Rohit's side, should the favourites progress.The Proteas' fearsome middle order of Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen \u2013 regarded as the best attacker of spin in the world - and David Miller, who has the highest average against slow bowling of any batter in top-tier ODIs since the start of 2022, would not be so conservative.Perhaps it is Temba Bavuma's side who are best set up to defy the odds.India are not unbeatable but defeating them will take something special.What information do we collect from this quiz?Related topicsSouth AfricaIndiaNew ZealandAustraliaCricket A win in an epic Test series this winter, the World Test Championship final in 2023 and, most significantly, the 50-over World Cup final later that year \u2013 the most recent meeting in this format.Confidence will be taken from that day when they chased for victory, playing on India's tendency to not stretch themselves in the biggest games when batting first.Rohit Sharma has spent the past two and a half years trying to beat that issue out of his side. \"Australia will back themselves to chase anything but if they bat first it could all end up in a heap,\" former England spinner Alex Hartley said.",

We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so.\"\nDutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the Netherlands supports Ukraine \"now more than ever\", adding: \"We want a lasting peace and an end to the war of aggression started by Russia. For Ukraine and its people, and for Europe.\"\nGermany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote that \"no one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine\", with his replacement-in-waiting Friedrich Merz adding that \"we stand with Ukraine\" and \"we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war\".\nGermany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the \"unspeakable\" row resembled a \"bad dream\" and \"underlined that a new age of infamy has begun\". \nShe said she would \"wholeheartedly push\" for measures that could help Ukraine \"withstand Russia's aggression even if the US withdraws support, so that it can achieve a just peace and not a capitulation\".\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: \"Ukraine, Spain stands with you,\" while his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk wrote: \"Dear [Zelensky], dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.\"\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada \"will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace\".\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese posted that his country had \"proudly supported the brave people of Ukraine in their struggle to defend their sovereignty against the brutality of Russian aggression and in support of international law\".\nEuropean Union chiefs Antonio Costa and Ursula von der Leyen assured Zelensky in a joint statement that he was \"never alone\".\n\"We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace,\" they said.\nThere were also supportive messages for Ukraine from political leaders in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Romania, Sweden and Slovenia.\nHowever, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban voiced his support for Trump, writing: \"Strong men make peace, weak men make war. Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr President!\"\nOn Saturday, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told the BBC he had spoken with Zelensky twice following the White House meeting.\nHe said he was \"not at liberty to say what was discussed\" but shared that he told Zelensky \"we have to respect\" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far.\nHe said Zelensky must \"find a way\" to restore his relationship with his US counterpart. \nZelensky left the White House early following his row with Trump - but afterwards thanked the US president on social media for his support, saying: \"Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"\nWriting on messenger app Telegram on Saturday, Zelensky said it was \"very important for us that Ukraine is heard and that no one forgets about it, neither during the war nor after\".\n\"It is important for people in Ukraine to know that they are not alone, that their interests are represented in every country, in every corner of the world,\" he added.\nIn an interview with Fox News following his White House visit, Zelensky said his row with Trump was \"not good for both sides\" but he thought the relationship could be salvaged.\nThe pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing an agreement that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals.\nFriday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sitting alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.\nZelensky responded by asking \"what kind of diplomacy?\", referencing a previous 2019 ceasefire deal that was agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east.\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called for a summit \"without delay\" between the US, Europe and allies on Ukraine.\nSir Keir's crunch talks at Downing Street on Sunday will see European leaders gear up efforts to police a future Ukraine peace deal.\nThe UK prime minister believes a deal will have to involve US military assets providing surveillance, intelligence and potentially warplanes giving air cover to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

        "article_text": "Stars, film fans and fashionistas rejoice as the biggest night in the showbiz calendar is here at last - the 97th Oscars.\nSpanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez leads the way with 13 nominations, but recently saw its awards chances damaged after offensive historic tweets from its star resurfaced.\nWicked, The Brutalist, Conclave and Anora are also among the top contenders, with the race for best picture too close to call.\nUS comedian Conan O'Brien is presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT).\nYou can also expect plenty of references during the night to the wildfires which devastated LA and left thousands of homes destroyed.\nHere are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).\nIt is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken. \nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).\nHowever, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.\nChasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.\nWicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.\nMeanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.\nAll the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nThe film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.\nBut there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.\nThis has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.\nIn the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.\nBut it's a tight race.\nThere were gasps backstage at the Baftas (where I was) when Anora star Mikey Madison scooped up the best actress prize.\nIt was a big blow to the assumed Oscar momentum for Moore, and an incredible moment for Madison, who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nBest actor may also be up in the air. Adrien Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.\nLast week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.\nIf he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.\nIn the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.\nIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.\nThis year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.\nIn fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.\nElsewhere, however, progress remains slow.\nCoralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five.\n\"Has there been progress, yes. Has there been enough? Absolutely not,\" April Reign, LA-based founder of the #OscarsSoWhite movement, told me.\n\"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough. It was also about gender, age, class, sexuality and geography too.\"\n\"If we're still able to count them on one hand, then we're not there yet.\"\nMost of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet \u2013 I'm already betting we'll see more tears and hand holding from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\nThere had been a big question mark over whether Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n will show up after the row over her past tweets.\nHowever, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.\nPresenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.\nThe nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.\nThere's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.\nCancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.\nShe told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.\n\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.\nThis year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.\nInstead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.\nI can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nDoja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.\nThe Academy Awards ceremony is hosted this year for the first time by comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien.\nHe replaces US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel, who has presented the show four times including last year.\nThe 2025 Oscars will air live on Sunday 2 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002.\nThe show can be watched in the US on ABC and can be streamed on Hulu. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.\nUK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.\nCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.\nIf she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.\nRalph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.\nElsewhere, Felicity Jones is nominated for best supporting actress for The Brutalist - a decade after her first Oscar nomination - while Sir Elton John is in the best original song race.\nThe country will also be rooting for two more screen legends - Wallace and Gromit (and their makers Aardman Animations), who are hoping for their fourth Oscar. They are shortlisted for best animated feature for their latest outing, Vengeance Most Fowl.\nRead more about this year's awards season films:",

How to watch the Oscars and who is nominated20 hours agoShareSaveNoor NanjiCulture reporter in Los Angeles\u2022@NoorNanjiShareSaveGetty ImagesMikey Madison and Demi Moore are both up for best actressStars, film fans and fashionistas rejoice as the biggest night in the showbiz calendar is here at last - the 97th Oscars.Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez leads the way with 13 nominations, but recently saw its awards chances damaged after offensive historic tweets from its star resurfaced.Wicked, The Brutalist, Conclave and Anora are also among the top contenders, with the race for best picture too close to call.US comedian Conan O'Brien is presenting the awards from Los Angeles, with the show starting at 16:00 (PT), 19:00 (ET) and midnight (GMT).You can also expect plenty of references during the night to the wildfires which devastated LA and left thousands of homes destroyed.Here are all the major talking points and things to look out for at the ceremony, as an eventful awards season draws to an end.Which films are in the running?NetflixEmilia P\u00e9rez, starring Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, has the most nominations this yearEmilia P\u00e9rez, about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, has 13 nominations in total \u2013 including best picture, best actress (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n) and best supporting actress (Zoe Salda\u00f1a).It is the most-nominated non-English language film of all time. Adrien Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.Last week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.In the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.10 years since #OscarsSoWhiteIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.This year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.In fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.Elsewhere, however, progress remains slow.Coralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.UK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.British buzzGetty ImagesConclave's Ralph Fiennes has his first best actor nomination for 28 yearsCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.If she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.Ralph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. \"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough.",

        "article_text": "Rami Qattoush's mother beams with pride, as her nine-year-old son tentatively kicks a football for the first time since his injury.\nIt is a huge milestone in his recovery, since he travelled to Jordan last month after getting Israeli military approval to leave Gaza.\nRami dreams of playing football one day, like Cristiano Ronaldo. But he is still in pain and quickly tires, having to sit down on a plastic chair, exhausted from the effort.\nHis bandaged legs - one of them splinted - are badly scarred and withered.\nEvery step forward is hard.\nDoctors in Gaza had urged the family to agree to have both of his legs amputated. But his eight-year-old brother, Abdul Salam, had already lost his lower right leg due to his injuries and their mother, Islam, begged the surgeons to save Rami's limbs.\nWarning - This article contains distressing content\nThe boys had been fast asleep in the family's third-floor flat in Maghazi in central Gaza when, their mother says, an Israeli air strike targeted the building next door, raining rubble and shrapnel on the children.\nRami's 12-year-old brother, Mustafa, was killed, his body blown to pieces.\nHis heart, pierced with shrapnel, was only found two days later, Islam says. The family gave it a separate burial.\nThe UN says at least 14,500 children are reported to have been killed and many more badly wounded in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began after Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people. \nMedical evacuations from Gaza are critical, it says, because the healthcare system there has been devastated. Only 20 of the territory's 35 hospitals are partially functional and there are shortages of essential medicines and equipment.\nAn estimated 30,000 Gazans \u2013 like Rami and Abdul Salam \u2013 have been left with life-changing injuries which will require years of rehabilitation, according to the World Health Organization. \nIt has helped facilitate the evacuation of hundreds of patients since 1 February when the Rafah crossing with Egypt reopened for them. But it says that between 12,000 and 14,000 people \u2013 among them 4,500 children \u2013 still need to be brought out for treatment.\n\"The war has exacted a horrific toll on Gaza's children,\" the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) said when a ceasefire deal was announced in January.\nRami endured several surgical procedures without painkillers, anaesthesia or antibiotics, his mother told the BBC. His wounds became so infected that they were crawling with maggots. Doctors did not think his legs could be saved.\n\"Rami was in such pain, he was screaming 'God, you've taken my brother, now take me too!'\" Islam says.\nAnd then, in January, a rare chance came up - for Rami and his mother to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment at a specialised hospital for reconstructive surgery, run by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) in Jordan's capital, Amman.\nIt is currently treating 13 children from Gaza, but has the capacity to take in dozens more.\n\"It's the only hospital I know of providing physical and mental rehabilitation for victims of war,\" says Marc Schakal, MSF programme manager for Jordan, Syria and Yemen. \"It's multi-disciplinary care, not just surgery.\"\nRami has a psychologist, surgeon and physiotherapist. He is also being fed, clothed, and taught at MSF's small \"School of the Future\", a bright prefabricated building in the grounds of the hospital. After missing so much education, he is a keen learner.\nBut he has also been missing his father Mohammed and his brother, Abdul Salam - who needs a prosthetic leg but wasn't able to leave Gaza with him.\nThey're grateful for their treatment, but both he and his mother want to return home as soon as they can.\n\"Gaza is beautiful,\" Rami told me. \"In Gaza before the war, we used to have medical treatment, but then the aid stopped.\"\nWith the facilities and expertise at the MSF hospital, he's now making quick progress.\n\"He arrived in a wheelchair,\" says his physiotherapist, Zaid Alqaisi, who has formed a strong bond with Rami while helping him to walk again. \n\"He's very motivated. He wants to get back to his friends and his family. He wants to make his dad proud.\"\nHe also wants to swim again in the sea in Gaza.\nBut many more operations lie ahead, and Rami and his mother have no idea when they will return home.\nNot knowing if they will be allowed back into Gaza is another huge stress for all of the Palestinian patients on top of their trauma, according to psychologist Zainoun al-Sunna. \nSharing a hospital room with Rami is a withdrawn and traumatized five-year-old boy, Abdul Rahman al-Madhoun, who also needs surgery on his legs.\nHe was in his mother's arms when she was killed in an air strike in October 2023, along with his siblings. In hospital in Gaza, a nurse trying to cheer him up told him his mother had turned into a star.\n\"Since then, he looks up into the sky at night, looking for stars and talking to them,\" his aunt Sabah says. \"He doesn't talk to other people. But I hear him saying to the stars: 'Mummy I've eaten, Mummy I'm going to sleep now.'\"\nThe psychological injuries of the hospital patients are often tougher than the physical.\n\"Some will never recover,\" says hospital director Roshan Kumarasamy, who says that reconstructive surgery will be needed on patients from Gaza for years to come because of an \"unimaginably massive spectrum of injuries\".\nBut Rami is strong and determined. When he breaks down in tears thinking of Mustafa, he reassures me it's \"OK\".\nAnd when he and his mother manage to get through to his family in Gaza on a video call, Rami is eager to show them how he can now stand on his own two feet.\nHis father cheers him on, saying: \"Rami, you're a hero.\"\nAnd now his family have another reason to celebrate \u2013 Rami's brother, Abdul Salam, and his father have just been given permission by Israel to leave Gaza for Jordan as well. \nIn the weeks to come, he should be fitted with a new leg, allowing both injured boys to relearn how to walk.",

This happened to a Cambridge University academic - but how has being in the spotlight affected her?\nA photo of Dr Ally Louks and her completed PhD thesis, posted to X in November 2024, attracted viral fame when it was viewed more than 120 million times - and the numbers have risen steadily since then.\nAmong the congratulations and interest in her subject - \"the politics of smell\" - were many disturbing comments, mysogynistic, accusatory and personally threatening.\nReflecting on the experience three months on, she says: \"This has undoubtedly changed my life... and while I would not wish this on anyone, it has given me a platform to speak positively about academia and research.\"\nDr Louks, a supervisor in English Literature at the university, is a self-confessed introvert and rarely used social media before posting her photo - which was mainly intended for her friends - on X.\nHer subject - \"Olfactory Ethics: The politics of smell in modern and contemporary prose\" - explored \"why certain writers of the past century use the language associated with smell to characterise harmful attitudes towards objects of disgust and desire\".\n\"I draw on the well-documented history of olfactory prejudice in order to examine its contemporary relevance,\" she says.\nFor example, her work looked at Hitler's claims about the smell of Jewish people in his book Mein Kampf, and how descriptions of the transatlantic slave trade were also used \"to legitimize racism\".\nHer seemingly innocent post attracted a number of abusive comments from people who believed women should stay out of academia and those who did not understand her work, and were \"under-informed or indeed uninformed\", as she puts it.\nThe comments included threats of rape and death.\nWithin about 36 hours of her post, the haters got on board.\n\"It was pretty all-consuming for the first week,\" she says. \n\"Replies were coming in far faster than I could read them, so I wasn't sleeping much in an attempt to keep up with the conversation. \n\"I won't pretend that it was pleasant to have people saying unkind things, but the critiques were ultimately quite baseless as they were based on the title and abstract of my thesis alone or were downright misogynistic. \n\"It never caused me to question the value or validity of my work. I tried to approach the situation with openness and intellectual curiosity, because there was some valid scepticism, and I've relished the opportunity to prove the worth of my work among the public audience that I've been gifted.\"\nDr Louks says she tried to approach the attention - both good and bad - in a positive way - and would advise anyone else to do the same.\n\"The positive comments I received significantly outweighed the negatives, but the negative ones were liked and shared which boosted them to the top of my feed.\n\"I refused to engage with anyone who was aggressive or insulting but I did respond to some people who were sceptical or just didn't understand my work. I was perfectly happy to prove the validity of it.\n\"I don't engage so there's no point in the negative posters carrying on.\n\"My story shows that it's possible to remain both open to criticism and respectful of others online whilst also defending what matters, which is the value and validity of research in the humanities and the legitimacy of women's role in academia.\"\n\"Initially I was very shaken up when the hateful comments starting coming in,\" she says.\n\"I'm an introvert and I never asked for this - and while some people say they are even jealous of this social media 'fame', I wouldn't wish this on anyone.\n\"But it has given me a platform to talk about the importance of academia so for me, personally, it's undoubtedly been a good thing.\"\nDr Louks now has been assigned both a British and American literary agent.\n\"It doesn't go over my head that the reason that I have all of these opportunities is because people responded to my work with such scepticism initially,\" she previously told the BBC.\nDr Louks says she received - and continues to receive - support from both her college and the university as a whole, which she describes as \"really heartening\".\n\"This experience has undoubtedly changed my life... but in many ways this experience hasn't changed me. \n\"I think a lot of people want this kind of attention, but I have never harboured a desire to become famous. \n\"What I am passionate about doing is sharing my research, sparking conversations about important social phenomena, and translating academic work for public audiences, and this experience has given me a platform to do that and to perhaps turn that into a career.\"\nFor someone who used to shy away from social media, she admits that \"all of the things I post get a lot of attention now because I have gained a large following. \n\"But the attention has been overwhelmingly positive since that initial post. \n\"I do think very carefully about what I say online now, and as a generally offline person, it has been a real learning experience, but I think you typically can't go too wrong if you remain open to feedback and approach discussions with generosity and a willingness to listen.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

And he really loved that.\nResidents in the New Mexico city say they were excited to welcome such a massive celebrity to the community when he and his wife Betsy Arakawa arrived more than 20 years ago, but they treated him like anyone else.\n\"He wasn't famous here\" was the phrase I heard when asking residents about why the movie star chose to call New Mexico's capital home. They describe a down-to-earth, chatty man who supported local businesses and enjoyed its flourishing arts scene.\nEveryone here has a story to tell about Hackman, who was found dead alongside his wife and their dog at their home in the quiet desert city earlier this week. \nHackman was a lover of the arts and a painter himself, so he fit in well: Santa Fe is known for its iconic adobe architecture and is home to more than 250 galleries.\nEverything in Santa Fe is colourful, from the woven tapestry hanging on shop walls to the clothes people wear and even their personalities.\nThere are murals in almost every alley and metal street art lining the roads. \nHackman immediately got involved with local art museums, most notably sitting on the board of directors at the Georgia O'Keeffe museum, while Arakawa had a luxury home-goods store, and collaborated with artists on various projects.\nHackman's paintings are displayed prominently at local restaurants, and there are a few lucky residents who have them hanging in their home.\nOne of those people is Stuart Ashman, the executive director of the Artes de Cuba gallery.\nMr Ashman first met Hackman at a community arts meeting. He was running late and there was one seat left when he arrived: next to the Hollywood star.\nThey shook hands and that started two decades of friendship.\n\"He was so down to earth that you didn't realize that you were talking to a celebrity. He was more interested in you than in telling you about himself,\" Mr Ashman said.\nWhile both men supported the arts community, their real bond came through Pilates workouts when they took back-to-back private lessons.\nWhen asked who was better, Mr Ashman laughed. \"I think we're both pretty bad,\" he said. \"Our teacher said I was lazy and he was older and stiffer.\"\nMr Ashman said Hackman often got in trouble for being too much of a chatterbox.\n\"Gene, are you going to workout or do you just want to talk to Stuart today?\" Mr Ashman recalls their Pilates teacher asking.\nEvery week, Mr Ashman, who raised chickens, would bring a dozen eggs to Hackman. \nThen one day, he showed up with a huge landscape painting as repayment to Mr Ashman, who didn't want to accept it. But Hackman insisted and said a painting for eggs is \"a very fair deal\". \nWhen Hackman wasn't at Pilates or riding his bike through the beautiful landscape, he loved to spend time at his home  in the hills above the city, his friends said.\nPerched on a 12-acre plot, the property has panoramic views of the surrounding mountains, with vistas stretching as far as Colorado.\nHackman purchased the home in the 1980s before starting expansive renovations. He wanted this home to have meaning, so he worked with an architect to blend  Pueblo, Colonial, and Spanish Baroque architectural styles to pay homage to Santa Fe's rich cultural history.\nArakawa also enjoyed her secluded life in Santa Fe. People I spoke to said she was a talented pianist and smart business woman. \nThe only person who liked working out more than Hackman was Betsy. They said she was in incredible shape, always attending exercise classes.  \nThough Hackman was an active member of the community for most of his post-Hollywood years, he became much more isolated after Covid-19 lockdowns, locals said.\nThose who knew him speculate his health and age made mobility too difficult to wander down the hill into town.\nBut everyone still had a story about Hackman.\nJames Roybal, a native of Santa Fe, once signed up for a pastel painting class in the 1980s and when he arrived Hackman was also there.\nThey painted next to each other for a bit, making small talk.\nMr Roybal couldn't believe the celebrity would want to be there. He took a picture from a ways back because he didn't think anyone would believe him. He still boasts about the image.\nVictoria Murphy, a real estate agent and actress, saw him around town on several occasions.\n\"I was in the middle of the street as I was crossing in the crosswalk, and he started to go through the stop sign at that time, and then suddenly saw me stopped, waved, smiled, held up both hands, you know, like in a surrender,\" she recalled.  \"And I just smiled and kept going.\"\nAt a local restaurant in town, customers told me they'd see him at the grocery store, or shopping on the high street. \nDavid, the general manager of a shop in downtown Santa Fe where Hackman was a long-time patron, was holding back tears, remembering his friend and client.\n\"Since he lived here, he wanted to use his money towards the local people. He always bought Seiko watches from my store for his friends and family. \n\"He invested in local restaurants and grocery stores, and showed up to openings for art museums. It obviously wasn't because he needed the money, but because he loved the local flare,\" he said.\n\"We lost a great Santa Fein.\"",

Platforms which collect UK children's user data must minimise the amount they gather and take extra care when processing it.\nThe ICO's investigations into Reddit and Imgur will focus on how the platforms check the ages of their users and their enforcement of age checks.\nOfcom said in October Reddit had overtaken X as the UK's fifth most popular platform.\nImgur, meanwhile, says on its website that it reaches more than 250 million people a month.   However, it does not state in which countries their users are based, so there is no figure for the number of people using it in the UK. \n\"I don't want to pre-judge how we might look at the Imgur and Reddit matters, but if there are age limits for accessing services, then the platforms have to enforce those in some ways,\" the Information Commissioner told the BBC. \n\"There are a number of different technologies and techniques that are available, I would say, and the degree of rigor, I think, depends in part upon the kinds of risks, the likelihood that children will be accessing those sites. \n\"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\"\nA Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\".\nImgur has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.\nThe investigations do not necessarily mean any of the three platforms have broken the law. \nBut companies which are found to have done so can be punished with enforcement notices and fines.\n\"We are patrolling, and there will be consequences for breaches of the law,\" said Mr Edwards.\nIt is not the first time TikTok has faced scrutiny from the ICO.  The platform is appealing against an ICO fine of \u00a312.7m in 2023 for misusing children's data issued in 2023. ",

        "article_text": "YouTuber Asmita Patel's mission was to \"make India trade\".\nThe wildly popular financial influencer called herself the \"She-Wolf of the stock market\" - her take on the Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street. At last count, she had clocked upwards of half a million subscribers on YouTube and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. Fees for her stock trading courses ran into thousands of rupees.\nLast month, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) put a spanner in the works. It barred her and six others from trading, alleging she was selling illegal stock tips disguised as investor education and making millions of rupees in the bargain.\nThe regulator's crackdown on Patel is its latest attempt to tighten the noose around social media influencers offering quick money schemes and trading advice disguised as education.\nIndia's post-pandemic market boom attracted a wave of new mom-and-pop investors. Online trading accounts grew from merely 36 million in 2019 to more than 150 million last year, data from the brokerage Zerodha shows.\nMany of these first-time market entrants relied on social media for trading tips which, in turn, birthed a new breed of self-styled \"investment gurus\" or \"financial influencers\" like Ms Patel, promising quick money.\nWith only 950 registered investment advisors and 1,400 financial advisors in the country, these influencers quickly filled the void, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers and followers.\nMost operated without regulatory registration, blurring the line between investment advice and stock market education. This prompted Sebi to crack down, banning at least a dozen influencers, including a Bollywood actor, from offering trading advice.\nThe regulator has also barred brokerages and market players from partnering with influencers who peddle illegal stock tips or make misleading return claims.\nSebi has also laid down strict guidelines for educators, effectively barring them from offering real-time trading tips or using live market data for educational purposes.\nThe regulator found Ms Patel and her husband, Jitesh, directing students and investors to trade specific stocks through their advisory firm. She allegedly used private Telegram channels, Zoom calls and courses to sell tips without mandatory registration.\nSebi acted in Ms Patel's case after 42 participants complained of trading losses and demanded compensation. It is now moving to seize millions of rupees that Patel and her associates earned from course fees between 2021 and 2024.\nAs markets correct, the economy slows and regulators crack down, other influencers face a credibility test.\nThousands of angry investors have recently accused high-profile influencers of faking their success to sell trading courses and earn millions in brokerage referrals. \nSebi's order in Ms Patel's case too revealed she made just over $13,700 (\u00a310,800) as trading profits in the past five years but earned more than $11.4m (\u00a39m) by selling courses.\nMs Patel didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nWhile Sebi's drive to protect small investors is well intentioned, its recent regulatory actions have drawn criticism for being delayed and lacking clarity.\nThe regulator has been both a \"selective\" and \"reluctant regulator\", Sucheta Dalal,  veteran financial journalist and author, told the BBC.\n\"It should have acted a few years ago when trading sites started paying influencers to promote their products. Now this phenomenon has become too big.\"\nSumit Agrawal, a former officer with Sebi, says the regulator singled out a few as an example instead of enforcing a clear, comprehensive policy.\n\"Curbing unregulated stock tips is necessary, but requiring trading schools to use three-month-old data for educational purposes and not teaching practical experience of trading strategies on live market crosses into over-regulation,\" he says.\nManish Singh, a chartered accountant and YouTuber with half a million followers, makes market analysis videos. He says Sebi's new rules have created confusion over what's allowed.\n\"Even genuine content creators who are trying to guide people in the right direction will lose subscribers and the monetary incentive of brand deals as confidence to work with creators is shaken,\" Singh told the BBC.\nBalancing this will be tough for the regulator, says Mr Agrawal. \nTechnology is inherently disruptive and the law is always \"playing catch-up\". Sebi's real challenge, he adds, is to monitor online content effectively without over-regulating. Notably, the Indian regulator wields broader powers than its counterparts in advanced markets like the US.\n\"It has extensive authority, including search and seizure powers and the ability to ban trading and freeze bank accounts without requiring a court order,\" says Mr Agrawal. \nA Reuters report, citing sources, says the regulator has again sought greater powers - its second request in two years - to access call records and social media chats in investigations into influencer-led market violations. \nThe challenge, say experts, will be to ensure it doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.",

The Pulitzer Prize winning play was written in 1940 but not staged until after O'Neill's death in 1956.\nA semi-autobiographical work dedicated to his wife, O'Neill described it as \"play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood.\"\n\"It has not been an easy project to get off the ground,\" Lange admits.\n\"This is a throwback to another kind of filmmaking and another kind of storytelling but in my mind this is the greatest American play ever written.\n\"It has this universality, this emotional depth. You'd be hard pressed not to relate to something in it, especially in the world we live in now.\"\nShe plays Mary Tyrone, the matriarch of an American family who's addicted to morphine since the birth of her sons, who struggles with loneliness and fears about her boys' health.\n\"Mary Tyrone is one of these parts which mean the world to me,\" says Lange.\n\"It may sound corny but I love her. It's thrilling as an actor to have a part like this.\"\nShe's played the role twice before on stage and it's the 2016 Broadway version, directed by Jonathan Kent, which has been brought to the screen. \nFilming wrapped in 2022 but it's only now that Lange and co-star Ed Harris have been able to premiere it in Dublin and Glasgow.\nShe arrived at the Glasgow Film Festival on Friday just as Tim Roth, who appeared in the opening film Tornado, departed.\nThe two actors were in the 1995 film Rob Roy, she as Mary McGregor, wife of Liam Neeson's Rob Roy, and he as the villainous Archibald Cunningham.\nAnd while Roth's abiding memories were of his war with the Highland midgie, Lange recalls a much more pleasant experience.\n\"It was such a marvellous time, up in the Highlands where I'd never spent time before and it was extraordinarily beautiful,\" she says.\n\"I had the whole family here and the kids had a whole life of their own going on.\n\"It was a very special time and I liked the film. Some locations and some projects you think, 'oh Christ why did I bother doing that?' and others you think 'that was something very special'.\"\nHer next projects will also focus on women. She's set to star in the film adaptation of Joan Didion's 2005 memoir The Year of Magical Thinking.\nAnd she's also keen to explore an extraordinary chapter in the life of the German actress Marlene Dietrich.\nIt focuses on the period when she moved to America and took US citizenship and the programme will reunite her with Feud and American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy.\n\"At a certain age in the eyes of Hollywood you are finished,\" says Lange.\n\"We touched on this in Feud about Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. This was the time in Dietrich's life, when she segued into this weird Las Vegas act and the story is about her meeting a young composer who helps her launch a whole new career as a performer.\"\nThat composer was Burt Bacharach and for five years their unlikely partnership revived her career.\n\"It's an interesting period,\" says Lange.\n\"It's also the time she goes back to Germany for the first time after the war, and takes her up to those years when she was living as a complete recluse in Paris.\"\nShe hopes the project will be up and running before the end of the year.\nHollywood may have a reputation for writing off its older women, but Jessica Lange, at 75, is still fighting their corner.",

        "article_text": "In one of the most exciting and dramatic awards seasons ever, the field is wide open in several fields. BBC film critics give their expert predictions for the major Academy Awards categories.\nCaryn James: It has been a fun awards season, watching the nominees for best picture pinball around. Anora became the early favourite as the brash young voice of the future, until the bonkers Emilia P\u00e9rez became the Oscar darling for a minute, then Conclave had its moment as the smart mainstream choice, until The Brutalist announced itself as the epic with artistic ambitions until... full circle, Anora is the frontrunner again. It says a lot about the strength and variety of films this year that such mayhem could happen at all. Anora \u2013 funny, original and a little bit heartbreaking \u2013 is the likely winner. And among the realistic choices (six of the nominees might as well be category filler, and Karla So\u00edia Gasc\u00f3n's unearthed offensive tweets shattered Emilia's chances), Anora should win. But lurking in the background is Conclave, which could win by consensus, given that voters rank their choices in this category. Simplistic scenario: votes for the top film are so scattered that Conclave finally gets the most votes because it's everybody's second choice. Plus, it really is a satisfying political thriller that happens to be set in the Vatican, and its Bafta and SAG awards are a sign of real support. In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.\nNicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. This year, things aren't so simple. What we can say, judging by all the other awards ceremonies that have been and gone this year, is that Dune: Part Two, Emilia P\u00e9rez, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance and Wicked are vanishingly unlikely to take home the biggest prize of the night. None of them has whipped up the enthusiasm that's required from both the public and the critics. That leaves us with Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Conclave \u2013 and over the last few weeks I've wavered between all four of them as the most likely best picture winner. As I write, Anora seems to be the favourite, and I can understand why. It's a film about contemporary American life made by an American auteur, and it balances uncompromising grittiness with exuberant, crowd-pleasing flair. In a year when arguments could be made for and against so many contenders, Anora has come to feel like the choice that could please everyone, so it may well complete the journey it began when it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0This is a strong category, but I doubt that the Academy's voters will go for a French director who was largely unknown in the US before she made\u00a0The Substance, so Coralie Fargeat is out. The various Emilia P\u00e9rez backlashes have hurt Jacques Audiard's chances, and A Complete Unknown hasn't received much praise for its directing as such, so James Mangold is a long shot, too. That means that the best director Oscar will either go to Sean Baker, for the verve and naturalism he brings to Anora, or to Brady Corbet, for the valiant artistic vision of The Brutalist. But the amiable Baker has made several excellent films that haven't garnered many awards, including Tangerine and The Florida Project, so I suspect that he will be the Academy's choice.\nCaryn James: This race comes down to a stark contrast, between Sean Baker, whose Anora is a beautifully orchestrated contemporary romp, and Brady Corbet, whose The Brutalist wilfully announces its ambition as the kind of film they don't make anymore, an historical epic complete with intermission. It's a good guess that Baker is likely to triumph, because he won the Directors Guild Award and the film won the Producers Guild award, two major predictors of the Oscars. And he should win. He made Anora feel effortless, but beneath that apparent ease is some masterful work, as he navigates the changes in tone \u2013 from fairy tale to screwball comedy to drama \u2013 that make the film so rich. Coralie Fargeat deserves her place here for her confident direction of The Substance, but it's really a two-man race.\nCaryn James: Adrian Brody was on his way to making this a done deal, having won every major precursor from the Golden Globe to the Bafta, until Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet got in his way by winning the SAG award for A Complete Unknown. Oscar voting had ended by the time Chalamet won, but as an indicator of how the votes go, SAG has a great track record. You can never underestimate Oscar voters' affection for a biopic, and Chalamet's take on Bob Dylan was a true embodiment of a character as well as a spot-on impersonation. But Brody is still very likely to win, and he should, for his searing performance as a Holocaust refugee. He creates a portrait of a man who is talented and ambitious, sometimes ruthless and sometimes vulnerable, and fully human. But let's acknowledge how strong the category is this year, the rare case where it would be perfectly appropriate for Ralph Fiennes, Colman Domingo or Sebastian Stan to win too.\nNicholas Barber: Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) are neck and neck, so it's tricky to say which attributes will tempt the Academy more. Will it be pain, anguish and a Hungarian accent, or a nifty impersonation elevated by some expert singing and guitar-picking? Will it be the long-awaited return to greatness of a Hollywood stalwart who has already won an Oscar, or the crowning of a fresh-faced youngster who has nonetheless amassed a tremendous body of work? It could go either way, but Chalamet's Oscar campaigning has been flawless \u2013 he has shown himself to be fun-loving and self-mocking, but at recent awards ceremonies, including Sunday's SAG Awards, he has emphasised how seriously he takes a difficult job \u2013 so I'm betting on him. My own personal favourite is the wonderfully versatile Ralph Fiennes, who is so quiet and reserved yet so racked by doubt in Conclave \u2013 but I doubt that this is his year.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here. Both Moore and Torres won Golden Globes for their roles, in a musical / comedy and in a drama respectively, and for most of the time since then, they've been the frontrunners. Madison shook things up when she won the Bafta, so it's now the closest of calls. But I reckon that Moore will win. Partly, that's because of her savagely self-parodying performance as a former A-list star being turned into a monster by the ageist entertainment industry. And partly it's because her comeback narrative, as spelt out in her Golden Globes acceptance speech, would furnish the Academy with the kind of feelgood story it loves so much.\nCaryn James: Demi Moore has been on an almost steady march toward her first Oscar, marred only by Mikey Madison's Bafta, ever since her pitch-perfect campaign/acceptance speech on winning the Golden Globe for The Substance. Moore checks all the boxes: the story of how Hollywood finally takes her seriously, the insider status and the no-holds-barred performance in a film with a resonant message. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win. Torres gives a beautifully nuanced, restrained performance in\u00a0I'm Still Here\u00a0as a grieving yet determined widow during Brazil's political dictatorship. But Oscars tend to go to screaming, yelling, tearing-down-the-scenery roles, which is what The Substance and Anora call for. A brilliantly subtle performance like Torres's has an uphill battle.\nCaryn James: There's a reason Kieran Culkin has won every major award in this category in the run-up to the Oscars: he really deserves to. His wilfully outrageous, sad and moving character of Benji in A Real Pain may have echoes of his role as Roman Roy in Succession, but it is also funny and affecting on its own, a delicate mix of comedy and tragedy. And it hasn't hurt his chances that every acceptance speech of his is wry, self-deprecating and fun to watch. Some winners make an earnest point of saying \"There is no winner\" or spreading the praise around, but Culkin has turned acceptances into a stand-up art form. In another year, Edward Norton might have taken the award for his sharply drawn performance as Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, but that seems like a very unlikely upset.\nNicholas Barber: This year's Oscars are harder to predict than usual, but the best supporting actor category is the exception that proves the rule. Ever since Kieran Culkin won the Golden Globe for his role in A Real Pain in January, he has kept on winning and winning \u2013 and now it feels as if there is no point in any of his competitors turning up to the ceremony at all. Even those of us who would argue that Culkin isn't really a supporting actor in the film, but a co-lead with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg, have had to accept the inevitable. The only regrettable part of the whole business is that this category is stacked with Oscar-worthy performances, namely Yura Borisov's soft-hearted Russian muscle in Anora, Edward Norton's gentle Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce's bluff tycoon in The Brutalist, and Culkin's old Succession co-star Jeremy Strong as controversial lawyer Roy Cohn in The Apprentice. If they hadn't been up against Culkin, any one of them might have won.\nNicholas Barber: For a while it looked as if Zoe Salda\u00f1a had this Oscar in the bag. Of course,\u00a0she isn't really a supporting actress\u00a0in Emilia P\u00e9rez, but one of the leads. As soon as voters put her in this category, though, it seemed to be hers for the taking. Not only does she deliver a fabulous performance that includes energetic song-and-dance numbers, but she is a mainstay of the Marvel and Star Trek cinematic universes, so she has helped Hollywood make zillions of dollars. Then a journalist uncovered Those Social Media Posts. The bigoted remarks made by the other star of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, stripped the film of much of its goodwill, and Salda\u00f1a's hopes were badly damaged in the explosion of recriminations. Oscars observers started wondering: Would Ariana Grande win for Wicked, instead? It's still possible, but Saldana has distanced herself smartly from the scandal, and made emotional speeches at other award ceremonies, including the Baftas and the SAG Awards, so the Academy will probably reward her for her work, rather than punish her for her co-star's opinions.\nCaryn James: Zoe Salda\u00f1a may be the one person to escape unscathed from the Emilia P\u00e9rez debacle, and get the Oscar, as she should. She has won every precursor award, and is actually the dynamic centre of the story. Rita, the lawyer who helps the title character to transition and create a new identity, gives Salda\u00f1a her richest role yet and she makes the most of it. Rita starts as a fiery, beleaguered small-town lawyer, wrestles with her conscience about being involved with a criminal, and eventually becomes a philanthropist, and Salda\u00f1a sings and dances her way through it all with grace and presence. And she had the perfectly crafted answer when first asked about her co-star's offensive tweets, saying she was \"saddened\". Very well played. Isabella Rossellini makes a huge impact as Sister Agnes in a small role in Conclave, and Monica Barbaro is amazing as she channels Joan Baez in A Complete Unknown, but they can't complete with Salda\u00f1a's Rita.\nCaryn James: Peter Straughan is sure to win for Conclave. He turns Robert Harris's potboiler novel into a sleek, thoughtful screenplay, which is a huge part of what makes the film \u2013 pretty talky when you think about it, and not exactly an action movie \u2013 so suspenseful and entertaining. Turning that straightforward novel into a faithful screenplay may sound simple, but in fact Straughn's adaptation has a magician's deft touch, taking the best of the story and making it much better. It's great to see that RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes's screenplay for Ross's Nickel Boys is nominated. It's a dazzling adaptation of Colson Whitehead's extremely literary novel, but the film hasn't received the kind of major awards traction it would need to compete. The rest of the category is fairly weak. The screenplay is the least of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Sing Sing is less about script than performance. And the banal screenplay for the biopic A Complete Unknown shouldn't even have a place in this conversation.\nNicholas Barber: Peter Straughan's gripping adaptation of Robert Harris's novel, Conclave, has picked up prizes at the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice awards, and the Baftas. And when Conclave won best picture at the Baftas, the film's director, Edward Berger, made a point of singing Straughan's praises. Is he unbeatable at this stage? The controversies swirling around Emilia P\u00e9rez may have put it out of the running \u2013 as adventurous as Jacques Audiard's screenplay is \u2013 and there doesn't seem to be much chatter about A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys and Sing Sing in this category. So, yes, unless there are some Conclave-style shenanigans going on behind closed doors, Straughan should triumph here.\nNicholas Barber: This is one of this year's toughest categories to predict. September 5 hasn't built any momentum over awards season, but the other four best screenplay nominees \u2013 Anora, The Brutalist, A Real Pain, The Substance \u2013 are all brilliant in their own distinctive ways, and were all written or co-written by the films' directors. Sean Baker's Anora script won at the WGA Awards; Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold's The Brutalist was given the prize by two US critics' organisations; Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain won at the Baftas, and Coralie Fargeat's The Substance won at Cannes last year. My own preference, in a year of extremely long films, is Eisenberg's precision-engineered screenplay for A Real Pain, because it doesn't waste a scene, or a syllable of dialogue, in a trim 90 minutes. But I think that Anora will beat it, which would be OK by me, too.\nCaryn James: This is one of the richest categories, with three very different, thoroughly deserving nominees. Sean Baker's Anora is fresh and bold. Coralie Fargeat's The Substance is audacious and zeitgeisty. And Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain is perceptive and humane to its core. Anora and The Substance were also nominated for best picture, a sign of strength that might give them an edge. But I'm guessing that A Real Pain, which should win, will come through in the end. Where Anora and especially The Substance owe a lot to those films' initial concepts, Eisenberg's screenplay is the work of a writer with an ear for making his dialogue both believable and affecting. Of course, Anora is coming on so strong in other categories, you can't possibly rule it out, but if voters want to spread the awards around they may see this as a chance to give A Real Pain some well-earned recognition.\u00a0\nCaryn James: Once, this race seemed down to Emilia P\u00e9rez v I'm Still Here, but Emilia's implosion clears the way for I'm Still Here, which will win now and always should have. Walter Salles's brilliantly moving story of a family dealing with the aftermath of their father's disappearance during the Brazilian dictatorship in the 1970s is an eloquent, timely masterpiece that reveals the personal cost of politics. The film is nominated for best picture, which it surely won't win, and Fernanda Torres for actress, where winning would be an upset, but those nominations are a sign of strength that will translate into winning the International prize. There isn't a weak film in this category, with The Seed of the Sacred Fig another standout, but I'm Still Here towers above the others. There were celebrations in Brazil at the nominations alone, and although Brazilian films have been nominated before, including Salles's 1998 Central Station, it looks like the celebrations will go on for the country's first Oscar in this category.\nNicholas Barber: A storm of bad publicity knocked Emilia P\u00e9rez off-course this awards season, and suddenly it seemed as if one of its competitors might grab the Oscar for best international film. The most likely of these would be I'm Still Here, a powerful and popular Brazilian political drama whose star, Fernanda Torres, has been nominated for best actress. Also in with a chance are Flow, a Latvian cartoon which is nominated for best animated feature film, and The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which was made in secret in Iran by Mohammad Rasoulof, and then smuggled out of the country. But a week is a long time in awards season, and the Oscars take place a whole month after Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's offensive tweets were unearthed. My hunch is that the storm is passing, and that Emilia P\u00e9rez, which won the equivalent prize at the Baftas, will get its Oscar, after all.\nNicholas Barber: Nineteen years ago, Nick Park (and his co-director) won the Oscar for Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Nine years ago, the Oscar went to Pixar's Inside Out. Follow-ups to both films are nominated this year, and as this is one category in which voters aren't averse to handing prizes to sequels, either of them could win. Things are looking especially promising for Aardman's claymation caper, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, a favourite of mine which nabbed not one but two Baftas \u2013 one for animated feature film and one for children's / family film. The dialogue-free Latvian charmer, Flow, has its cheerleaders, too, whereas Memoir of a Snail, an Australian stop-motion animation, is just too gloomy to get voters behind it. That leaves the nominee which I believe will win: The Wild Robot. It's a sci-fi epic, yet it has a big heart and loveable picture-book visuals. Besides, its writer-director, Chris Sanders, made Lilo & Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon, but has never won an Oscar. Surely his peers will want to rectify that this year?\nCaryn James: How important is box office? That may be the deciding factor in this race, which is between two eco-themed films: The Wild Robot, the frontrunner, and Flow, its only likely competition. Flow is a true original, a dialogue-free Latvian film about a cat who tries to survive a flood. The Wild Robot is a funny, heart-tugging story about an intelligent robot, voiced by Lupita Nyong'o, who grows a human heart after being stranded on an island full of animal creatures facing an environmental crisis of its own. The Wild Robot has starry voices, including Pedro Pascal as Fink the Fox and Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, and it has earned more than $300m. In itself that might not be enough to get the Oscar, but the combination of star power, a timely message and its popularity with audiences is likely to make it the winner. And it is charming, so fair enough. The attention to Flow so far might be its best reward.\nCaryn James: There are years when documentaries with urgent political messages become the undeniable frontrunners and inevitable winners, such as Navalny in 2023 and 20 Days in Mariupol last year. This is one of those years. The extraordinary No Other Land will win and it should. Its eye-opening first-hand look at a village in the West Bank from 2019 to 2023, when Israeli forces destroyed homes and displaced the villagers, makes the cost of the conflict visceral. The film's backstory is compelling: it was made by a team of Israelis and two Palestinians, whose personal stories shape the film. And it resonates with even more impact since the turmoil in the Middle East continues. The film has not found a US distributor despite earning awards from several festival and critics' groups. but it has done very well in self-distribution. A vote for it might even convince the Hollywood players who have the power to release it wider.\nNicholas Barber: The past two winners of the Oscar for best documentary feature were 20 Days in Mariupol, which celebrated the resilience of the Ukrainian people during the current war, and Navalny, which condemned Vladimir Putin's regime. That trend could well continue this year, at a time when those inter-related topics are more urgent than ever, with the prize going to Porcelain War. Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev's film offers an intense, citizen's-eye view of the conflict in Ukraine, and shows civilians being trained as combatants. What separates it from other such documentaries is that the main participants, Leontyev and his wife Anya Stasenko, are artists who sculpt and paint exquisitely patterned porcelain animals. The theme is the importance of storytelling and creativity as ways to resist oppression \u2013 and what could be more appealing to Hollywood's film-making community than that?\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0If voters feel that a film as lucrative as Wicked shouldn't go away empty-handed, then giving it the prize for best original score is one obvious way for them to show it some love. But my money is on Daniel Blumberg's awe-inspiring score for The Brutalist, which won the Bafta in the same category. One of the questions raised by Brady Corbet's film is how such a low-budget indie drama can seem so epic, and the music has a lot to do with it. It's big, bold and experimental, with strange ticking and clinking noises to establish the theme of construction, stately motifs to echo the characters' grand ambitions, and some symphonic bombast and wild jazz to convey the thrill of arriving in the US in the middle of the 20th Century. It's also deeply eerie at times, so you can expect it to be used on trailers for horror films and science-fiction sagas for years to come.\nCaryn James: It might seem like Emilia P\u00e9rez and Wicked have the edge, but the songs that pop out of these musicals have their own category. Here, the award for the background music is between Conclave's Volker Bertelmann, who won the Oscar for his music in\u00a0All Quiet on the Western Front\u00a0(like Conclave, directed by Edward Berger), or Daniel Blumberg, who won this year's Bafta for his score for The Brutalist. Both scores serve their films well. Bertelmann's classical style adds suspense to the Vatican thriller. But I'd give the edge to Blumberg, who should win for his evocative score that adds a touch of the contemporary to the film's post-World War Two setting. Sometimes jazz-infused, sometimes commanding, his score enhances the mood without thwacking viewers over the head.\nCaryn James: The film that should win wasn't even nominated. It's still a head-scratcher why Jomo Fray's eloquent, imaginative cinematography for Nickel Boys, which gracefully meshed with director RaMell Ross's first-person narrative, wasn't acknowledged, while the film got a best picture nod. But there are two very strong contenders among the nominees. The Brutalist, shot in old-style, widescreen, rarely used VistaVision, has epic sweep, and is full of clarity. And Nosferatu's cinematography is a beautiful mix of colour in its scenes of daily life, and darkness in the shadowy world of the vampire. Jarin Blaschke, who has worked on previous, stunning Robert Eggers's films, equals that work in Nosferatu and should win. But The Brutalist and Lol Crawley probably will, if only because the film has been so much in the awards conversation, while Nosferatu definitely hasn't.\nNicholas Barber: The fact that Nickel Boys didn't get onto the shortlist for its immersive first-person camerawork is one of the Oscars' most puzzling oversights this year, and it's a shame, too, that the stylish Conclave was ignored. Of the films that were nominated, Nosferatu boasts glorious mountain vistas and shadowy Victorian chambers, while The Brutalist has the geeky appeal of large-format VistaVision film stock. But I have a feeling that the Academy will honour Greig Fraser's stunning views of uncanny alien worlds in Dune: Part Two. After all, voters have to give at least something to bona-fide Hollywood blockbusters, and this would be a worthwhile way for them to do so.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

After escaping with a draw despite a woeful first 70 minutes at Everton last Saturday, 48 hours later chief executive Omar Berrada was telling staff up to 200 jobs could go in a second round of redundancies.\nIt took a backs-to-the-wall second-half display against relegation-threatened Ipswich on Wednesday to claim a vital Premier League win after more defensive mistakes and Patrick Dorgu's red card threatened a sixth home defeat of Amorim's short reign.\nThe Portuguese says life is \"hard\" just now - but remains convinced better times lie ahead.\n\"I see a clear path, and I see that from the board also,\" he said in the build-up to Sunday's home FA Cup fifth-round tie against Fulham. \"They are also doing difficult changes.\n\"They are not popular but they are doing it because they have a vision. In the future we need to show some results. You can do a lot of changes but if you don't have results, people don't feel confident and happy.\n\"The good thing is we have a clear path. Now [it] is hard but we are doing things to achieve success in the future.\"\nUnited's inconsistency puts even more focus on the two cup competitions they remain in - they face Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie on Thursday - as it appears increasingly likely winning one of them is the only way they will qualify for European football next season.\nThe issues he is facing are so extensive, Amorim could be forgiven for wishing he had stuck to his initial demand not to leave Sporting until the end of the season.\nHowever, he does think dealing with so many problems has made him a more rounded coach.\n\"Better [coach] is hard to say, because I am not winning games,\" he said. \"But in three months here, I live certain things that I think make me a more complete manager.\n\"Sometimes you need to lose and be in a poor situation to grow.

        "article_text": "Located off Donegal's coast, this car-free isle was last inhabited full-time in the '70s. Now, locals are resurrecting a lost way of life \u2013 and adventurous travellers are welcome.\nFriday night on Owey Island and it's like we've been time-warped into the Ireland of years gone by. Smoke from burning turf fills the air as the small cluster of locals potter in and out of their well-maintained houses, sharing freshly caught fish and odd jobs. Friendly dogs roam free and chickens strut about. And as the roar of the sea and rustling of the reeds harmonise with warm, convivial chatter, it's hard to believe this lively haven lay dormant for decades. \u00a0\nLocated off the coast of west Donegal in the Atlantic Ocean, the remote island of Owey (or Uaigh in Irish, meaning \"cave\") is approximately 15 minutes by boat from Cruit Island, which is joined to the mainland via a short car bridge. There is no ferry service to Owey, visitors can only access the island by kayak or private boat. There's also no electricity or running water, so only the distant lights twinkling from the mainland hint of civilisation \u2013 and modern-day pressures \u2013 further away.\nLast inhabited full-time in the 1970s, the island was home to around 100 residents and about 30 families at its pinnacle. But the lure of modern conveniences on the mainland led to a dwindling population, with the last remaining islanders leaving in 1977 and the place lying abandoned for more than 25 years.\nI was spending a long weekend on Owey with the Wild Women of the Woods (Northern Ireland), an organisation of more than 4,000 members that aims to connect women from all over Ireland to experience nature and adventure together in wild, untamed settings. Outdoor enthusiast Rachel Pedder, who set up the organisation, wanted to bring the group \"somewhere that was off the beaten track and not generally accessible\".\nShe explained: \"It is hard to get to. At any of the other islands you can rock up at on a ferry and have a dander about and stay, whereas Owey it very much belongs to the community. You have to be very respectful of the fact that it's really their island and as long as you respect that, then they are welcoming.\" she added.\nPaul Cowan, one of the first wave pioneering Owey's renaissance, spent his teenage years on Owey, having moved here with his family in the early 1970s to escape the unrest on the streets of Belfast at the height of the Troubles.\u00a0\"My mother's from Rutland Island, which is the next island to it,\" explained Cowan. \"The Troubles had got really bad and my father thought the best way out was to buy a house on an island. That was it. We all moved [to Owey].\"\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nHaving since returned to Belfast to marry and settle with their own families, Cowan and his brother decided to take their kids on a boat trip to Owey in the early 2000s for a change of scene.\nDespite finding the island deserted, with many of the old cottages and outhouses turned to ruin after more than 25 years of neglect against the Atlantic breeze, the brothers saw the potential in the place as a peaceful escape from their busy, city lives. Along with some of their other siblings (there are 12 of them altogether) they set about fixing up the old family home and started building new houses.\nSeeing fresh life breathed into the place, other descendants of the island, who like Cowan had spent time there throughout their youth, were inspired to return and fix up the old properties in an attempt to return Owey to its former glory. Resurrecting the dilapidated houses was no easy task, however, with all supplies having to be brought over by boat. But around 20 homes are now standing, with a seasonal community of 20-30 people living here during the warmer months. There is also one hostel that sleeps up to six people (and a spot for wild camping), but no shops or other facilities.\nOwey's isolation is what attracts both locals and travellers. The seasonal community are passionate about keeping the island untouched by present-day conventions. Visitors are generally wanting to disconnect from the fast pace of life elsewhere or seeking adventure, with the rugged landscape attracting kayakers for the sea caves and rock climbers for the sea cliffs, as well as hill walkers.\nSix of our 14-strong group were staying in Owey Island Cottage Hostel, which islander Niall McGinley opens up to visitors in summer, and others were camping in the next-door-neighbour's garden.\nPlan your trip:\nWhen to go: From March to September. It's difficult to get on and off the island when the weather is harsher during autumn and winter.\nWhere to stay: Owey Island Cottage Hostel offers self-catering accommodation for up to six people during the warmer months (booking is essential). There is a gas stove but no fridge. You can also free camp on the green space beside the pier, where there is a compost toilet for public use.\nWhat to do: Hike the island hills, climb the sea cliffs with Unique Ascent, wild swim in the clifftop lake, take a guided kayaking tour of the sea caves with Selkie Sailing.\nWhere to eat: There is nowhere on the island to buy food and drink so bring all provisions with you. Cruit Island Golf Club serves food and drink in a scenic setting.\nThe hostel was once McGinley's grandmother's home and the last house on the island to be lived in, so it has weathered the decades of neglect better than most. Still retaining much of its original furniture, the cottage has two bedrooms off the main living space, where there's a gas stove, table and chairs and an open fire for everyone to gather around in the evenings. Befitting how the islanders have always lived, amenities are limited to a compost toilet in an outhouse, just a stroll away at the back of the cottage.\u00a0\nOne local, Frankie Gallagher, calls the island home because it's the birthplace of his father, and after growing up in Scotland, he now divides his time between Owey (weather permitting) and the Donegal mainland. \"Certainly we would never be looking to get electricity into the island because we can actually do well around it,\" he said.\nAlongside using gas and solar for heat, light and power, the islanders use tanks on the roof to collect rainwater. This allows Gallagher to have a gas shower in his home with the water pump running off solar. \"But it is slightly limited because there's only so much water that you can store so you have to be conscious about how long you're in the shower,\" he added.\nGallagher says this simpler lifestyle means sunsets are spectacular, with no light pollution and highly visible star constellations. He said apart from the occasional roar of a quad bike, the greatest noise pollution is from a corn crake, a rare \u2013 and noisy \u2013 bird that was once native to the island and often returns in summer.\nThe hostel is about 10 minutes on foot from where the boat docks, and after picking my bed for the night (with the help of a couple of curious free-range chickens) I sauntered down to the nearby ravine for a dip, catching the last of the sun as it glistened across the water.\nStay connected:\nDespite having no power lines, internet connection on Owey is excellent. However, there is no electricity to plug in a charger so bring a portable charger for your phone and other tech.\nThe car-free island measures just more than 300 acres in total. The southern end is grassy and fertile with a small harbour for boats to berth. Steep steps from the pier bring you to a dirt path leading to the \"village centre\" where all the homes are built on either side of a long, narrow, gurgling stream, backed by undulating hills as far as the eye can see.\nFragments of the olden days remain in the form of crumbled stone ruins, including the old schoolhouse (there was once a school, a shop and a post office on the island) alongside signs of new life, like wheelbarrows and fishing tackle interspersed among vegetable plots and flowerbeds.\u00a0\nBy contrast, the northern end of the island is exposed, rocky and barren \u2013 too rough to live on \u2013 with jagged cliffs jutting out from the sea caves that give the island its name, accompanied by vertiginous sea stacks rising majestically from crashing waves buffeted by the northern winds.\nA highlight of my trip was an adrenalin-fuelled kayaking tour of the sea caves with Selkie Sailing, a family-run business where husband and wife team, Gareth and Amanda Doherty, guide large groups across the water from Cruit Island on sit-on-top kayaks. We spent an exhilarating three hours on Saturday afternoon negotiating the waves around the rocks on the environs of the island, squeezing through soaring granite structures and meandering in and out of crevices so cinematic it was like we were extras in a movie.\nTo enjoy this unspoilt beauty in a more laid-back way, on Sunday afternoon, our group went in search of a clifftop lake, hidden amongst the rocks at the back of the island with a panoramic view of the sea. It's where one of the islanders told us they often go for a wash and a dip. To reach it, we climbed wild path north of the hostel, ascended a grassy hill that led to a plateaued cliffside and then carefully made our way down glistening pink and grey granite to discover the lagoon in all its glory.\nPlunging into shiny, black freshwater flanked by moss-covered rocks, we swam, washed and laughed \u2013 engulfed by the surreal beauty of being in a clifftop lake overlooking the ocean. I surprised myself by how relaxed I felt around people I'd only just met and a sense of peace enveloped me. We were blissfully marooned together on island time. Our roles as mums, grannies, professionals and partners were whisked away with the Atlantic wind. There was nowhere to be and nothing to rush for.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town\n\u2022\u00a0The UK's network of free hiking 'hotels'\n\u2022\u00a0Ireland's heartbreaking walk of forced emigration\n\u00a0\nOur last night on Owey was similar to the other evenings on the island: we prepared vegetables outside the cottage while the sun went down, cooked on the gas stove in candlelight and feasted on bean stew and wine around the campfire where the small group of locals \u2013 who we'd got to know over the course of the weekend \u2013 joined us for more revelry and a rapturous sing-song.\nSitting outside, watching the flames of the fire dance in the wind and listening to a group rendition of the Rare Auld Times, one of my campmates turned to me and said, \"We're winning aren't we?\".

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nSuperb Wigan thrash Warrington in Las Vegas\nLas Vegas, a city built around extravagance and opulence, with the blinking bright lights of giant electric billboards, garish neon signs and enormous flashing video screens, feels about as far away from the traditional northern England rugby league heartlands as it's possible to get. \nUltimately though, that's entirely the point of the sport's Sin City adventure. \nTaking a game that has always struggled for attention in the crowded sporting marketplace to a city, and indeed a country, with no history or heritage in the game may, for many, seem an unusual and expensive gamble. \nStill, if you're going to take a chance there's perhaps no more fitting place on earth than Las Vegas to roll the dice.\nIt is, after all, a city well used to hosting major global sporting events like boxing, the Super Bowl and Formula One - and rugby league is now securely on that illustrious list. \nIf there were any questions about the ambition and commitment to this festival of rugby league, they were answered on Thursday evening in downtown Vegas. \nAustralia's Tamika Upton scored five tries in Australia's 90-4 thrashing of England in Las Vegas\nThe Australian National Rugby League (NRL), the driving force behind the project, turned the world-famous Freemont Street into a spectacular red carpet walkway filled with dancers, musicians, drummers and sporting celebrities to welcome the players from the eight teams involved. \nMore than 10,000 fans turned up to the event, creating a carnival atmosphere the like of which the sport has never seen before. \nMany watching on from the barriers were left open-mouthed at the scale of the welcome. \nAnd all that before a ball had even been kicked.\nSuper League may not have been here at all had it not been for the vision of Wigan Warriors chief executive Kris Radlinski. \nTwelve months ago, he reached out to the NRL to get his side involved, having watched last year's inaugural event that was limited to just Australian clubs.\n\"I never thought it'd be like this, it's bigger than I imagined,\" said Radlinski.\n\"But it's what we deserve. I want everyone at home to believe what's possible. We've been through so much as a sport, so much effort goes on behind the scenes and we're in Las Vegas - it's exciting. We should enjoy and embrace it.\"\nLike being in a washing machine - England's tough night in Vegas\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nWigan impress in Las Vegas with win over Warrington\nAt the iconic Allegiant Stadium, one of the world's most impressive sporting arenas and home to NFL side the Las Vegas Raiders, Radlinski's Wigan put on a show befitting their tag as World Club Champions, soundly beating Warrington Wolves in the event's opening match. \nEngland Women suffered a record defeat in their historic international against Australia. \nThere were victories too for Canberra Raiders and Penrith Panthers in the NRL matches.\nBut for even the most loyal travelling fans and the broader game, this was about much more than results.\n\"This is what this is all about, the opportunity to put the game in a new global territory in front of new audiences while also giving the players and the fans new experiences,\" said Rhodri Jones, the managing director of RL Commerical and one of those charged with building the English rugby league brand.\nMore than 45,000 people attended the Allegiant Stadium during the course of the four games - an increase of around 5,000 on last season's two matches\n\"I think we've grasped the opportunity with both hands, I don't think we could have done any more. \n\"Hopefully people at home have seen this has been an unbelievable event and hopefully it will be even better next year. \n\"The number of ticket sales is better than last year so that tells you that we have collectively made an impact.\"\nBut where does the game go from here? A number of English clubs have already expressed an interest in playing in next year's event, which has now been confirmed as again featuring Super League sides. \nIt is fairly easy to see why. Future options include building the World Club Challenge into the programme and expanding the number of games.\nBut while this has all undoubtedly been an exciting new departure for the fans already engaged in the sport, what impact this will all have on rugby league's future as a truly global sport remains unclear. \nWhat is certain is that rugby league has entered a bold new era.\nWigan fans travelled to Las Vegas to watch their team beat Warrington\nWarrington half-back George Williams walks down the red carpet as he is introduced to fans",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has imposed\u00a0his long-threatened 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods, as well as a new 10% levy against China, citing the countries' failure to stop the export of chemicals used in the production of the powerful opioid fentanyl.\nThe US has long accused Chinese corporations of knowingly supplying groups involved in the creation of the drug. Beijing has hit back with tariffs of its own.\nThe White House has also accused Canada and Mexico of failing to prevent criminal gangs from smuggling fentanyl into the US.\nBeijing has hit back with a 15% tariff of its own, and Canada has announced 25% tariffs against $30bn worth of US goods, with an additional $125bn worth of products to be hit over the next 21 days. \nMexico is expected to respond later on Tuesday.\nFentanyl is a synthetic drug manufactured from a combination of chemicals. US regulators approved it for use in medical settings as a pain reliever in the 1960s, but it has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.\nOver 74,000 Americans died in 2023 after taking drug mixtures containing fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nIt is frequently mixed with other illicit drugs, leading many users to be unaware that the substances they are consuming contain fentanyl.\nAs little as a two milligram dose of fentanyl - roughly the size of a pencil tip - can be fatal.\nOver the past decade, the global fentanyl supply chain has expanded, making it harder for law enforcement and policymakers to control.\nChina is the primary source of the precursor chemicals used to produce fentanyl.\nSince September, 7,793 lb (3,534kg) of fentanyl have been seized in the US, according to figures published by US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).\nAlmost all (98%) was intercepted at the southwest border with Mexico. Less than 1% was seized across the northern US border with Canada. The remainder was from sea routes or other US checkpoints.\nAccording to the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), Mexican criminal organisations - including the Sinaloa Cartel - play a key role in producing and delivering fentanyl, methamphetamine and other illicit drugs into the US.\nThe chemicals used to make fentanyl are sourced from China by traffickers and turned into the finished product in labs in Mexico before being smuggled into the US.\nAccording to the DEA, the Sinaloa Cartel uses a variety of tactics to conceal shipments coming into Mexico, such as hiding the chemicals among legitimate commercial goods, mislabelling the containers, using front companies, and shipping through third party countries.\nThe Trump administration has accused the Mexican government of colluding with the drug cartels. Mexico's President Sheinbaum says the claims are \"slander.\"\nIn December, shortly after Trump had threatened Mexico with tariffs, the country's security forces announced their largest ever seizure of fentanyl - equivalent to around 20 million doses.\nIn response to the threat of tariffs from the US, on February 5th the Mexican government launched Operation Northern Border, deploying 10,000  national guard troops along the US-Mexico border.\nIn the latest government announcement on the operation, the Mexican government said that in the month since the operation launched, 55.9kg of fentanyl have been seized.\nIn 2019, China classified fentanyl as a controlled narcotic and later added some of the chemicals used to make it to the list.\nDespite this, the trade in other chemicals involved in the manufacturing of fentanyl - some of which can have legitimate purposes - remain uncontrolled, as those involved in the trade find new ways to evade the law.\nA review of several US indictments, which include details of undercover agents communicating with Chinese manufacturers, suggests that some chemical companies in China have been selling chemicals - including controlled ones - in the knowledge that they are intended to make fentanyl.\nDozens of indictments reviewed by BBC Verify detail instances where Chinese manufacturers have provided instructions on how to make fentanyl from products they sell, through encrypted platforms and cryptocurrency payments.\n\"So you have these massive loopholes where criminals engage in selling legal products, but they knowingly sell them to criminal entities,\" says Vanda Felbab-Brown, senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institute.\nIn a statement, China said it had some of the strictest drugs laws in the world and had conducted joint operations with the US in the past.\n\"The US needs to view and solve its own fentanyl issue,\" it said.\nAnd while China remains the main source of the chemicals used to make fentanyl, the DEA has also identified India as an emerging major source for these chemicals.\nIn a US indictment from January 2025, two chemical companies in India were charged with supplying the chemicals used to make fentanyl to the US and Mexico.\nPresident Trump has accused Canada - alongside Mexico - of allowing \"vast numbers of people to come in and fentanyl to come in\" to the US.\nAccording to data from the US Customs and Border Patrol, only about 0.2% of all seizures of fentanyl entering the US are made at the Canadian border, almost all the rest is confiscated at the US border with Mexico.\nBut in January, Canada's financial intelligence agency reported that organised criminal groups in Canada are increasingly involved in the production of fentanyl by importing chemicals used to make it and lab equipment from China.\nThe trade in fentanyl takes place in both directions. \nIn the first 10 months of 2024, the Canadian border service reported seizing 10.8lb (4.9kg) of fentanyl entering from the US, while US Border Patrol intercepted 32.1lb (14.6kg) of fentanyl coming from Canada.\nIn December, the country pledged C$1.3bn ($900m; \u00a3700m) for combating fentanyl and enhancing border security.\nAnd on February 11th, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the appointment\u00a0 Kevin Brosseau, as Canada's fentanyl czar. \nAdditional reporting by Lucy Gilder. \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "article_text": "Was it pruning or felling? \nThe alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it.\nThe chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn.\nThe trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture.\nBut rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them.\nThe Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics. \n\"We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees,\" says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them.\nThe project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000\u20137,000 still left to be mapped.\nDespite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined.\nThis is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late.\nBut on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies.\nThe trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says.\nThe Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected \"pleasure gardens\" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment. \nThe chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today.\nAccording to government literature,  in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests. \nEmperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022.\nInterestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019.   \nBut environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees.\n\"Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled,\" he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage.\n\"The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other,\" he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally.\nChinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine.\nGovernment projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage.\nLast week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits.\n\"The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit,\" Mr Bhat says. \n\"Because without chinar, Kashmir won't feel like home.\"",

        "article_text": "More than a century after its medieval centre served as the backdrop of Nosferatu, a new Oscar-nominated remake is putting this Gothic city back on the map.\nI gasp. A gaunt vampire with menacing fingernails on the prow of a schooner looms before me, sending a chill up my spine.\nI'm standing before the Wassertor gate in Wismar, a windswept gabled and red-brick Gothic city on northern Germany's Baltic coast. I had been wandering the cobblestone streets leading from the harbour towards the city's medieval, Unesco-inscribed centre, when my eye caught the small plaque bearing a stylised vampire that stopped me in my tracks.\nI've come to Wismar to trace one shadow of Germany's dark past \u2013 the legacy of my German Jewish grandfather, Berthold Levi, who left behind a secret love child when he escaped Nazi Germany in 1937. But in retracing his steps and visiting my half-cousins, I've stumbled upon another shadow: that of Count Orlok, a vampire who terrorised these very streets more than a century ago. That's because Wismar isn't just a fetching medieval city; it's also the legendary setting of director FW Murnau's 1922 masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.\nSoon after I come face to face with the pint-sized vampire, my half-cousin Katharina leads me towards two other markers commemorating where Murnau shot some of cinema's most haunting scenes in this 13th-Century city: one at the sprawling Marktplatz square, where an ornate pavilion-like tower rises overhead; and another near the modest Holy Spirit Church, home to a beautiful garden.\nA loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the silent film follows German real estate agent Thomas Hutter on his journey to Transylvania to meet Count Orlok. The vampire, mesmerised by Hutter's blood and a photograph of his wife Ellen, follows him back to the fictional \"Wisborg\" (Wismar), where he spreads plague and death until Ellen sacrifices herself, luring the vampire into the lethal rays of dawn.\nThe film's success, however, came at a cost. Stoker's widow sued the production company for copyright infringement and German courts ordered every copy of\u00a0Nosferatu\u00a0to be destroyed. Yet, like Count Orlok himself, the film refused to die: a few copies had already been made and were circulating in Europe.\nAnd still,it refuses to rest. Robert Eggers' reimagined 2024 Nosferatu film, starring Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, breathed new life into the eternal tale. While Prague's Barrandov Studios stand in for Wismar, the adaptation honours Murnau's nightmarish vision and is up for four Academy Awards on 2 March.\nNosferatu's reach even extends to my current lodgings. In my half-cousin Alexander's home, a coffin greets visitors in the foyer, daggers and a taxidermy bat adorn the wall and fake spiders and cobwebs cling to every surface. I'd initially dismissed it as some kind of quirky goth aesthetic, but after eyeing the Nosferatu plaques, I wonder: is it an homage?\nI'm quickly realising that, more than a century later, Wismar still relishes its role as the real-life setting behind one of horror's most enduring tales.\nToday, Wismar remains refreshingly crowd-free, welcoming mostly Germans to enjoy the brief Baltic summer. Its tourism season begins in March with Herring Days (15-30 March 2025), when \"the whole market square smells of fried herring\", says the head of Wismar Tourism, Sibylle Donath, drawing locals out like fresh blood for Count Orlok.\nOne of the few times in recent memory when visitors did flock to this relatively quiet, 44,000-person city was in 2022 when Wismar (and much of Germany) celebrated Nosferatu's centennial with creativity and gusto. A Berlin museum hosted on-site blood donations. Konstanz held a lakeside production. In the nearby city of L\u00fcbeck, where parts of the film were also shot, an illuminated Nosferatu-themed window installation was displayed in the warehouses that Count Orlok intended to purchase.\nIn Wismar, the city organised guided bat walks and the film was screened more than 50 times across many landmark venues. At the 13th-Century St George's Church, a Nosferatu theatre experience attracted 4,000 visitors. The city also launched Nosferatour, an immersive outdoor theatre production that's expected to return in 2026 where visitors follow towering papier-mache puppets through the city's medieval streets. And Festspiele, a classical music festival that organises about 190 concerts annually in the surrounding Mecklenburg-Vorpommern region, hosted an extraordinary open-air event and screening in the harbour where Count Orlok's ship arrives.\n\"The harbour scene in Nosferatu is iconic,\" Ursula Haselb\u00f6ck, the director of Festspiele, told the BBC. \"Wismar's maritime history and old Hanseatic architecture create a very special atmosphere. You can almost imagine Nosferatu creeping through the streets \u2013 it's definitely best explored in daylight!\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022 Essen: Germany's 'ugly duckling' city success\n\u2022 Where people drink beer for breakfast\nNow, just three years after the centennial, Wismar is gearing up to welcome even more Nosferatu fans. \"The new Nosferatu film [is reawakening interest] in the Hanseatic city of Wismar,\" Donath said. \"We are expecting tourists from abroad and also younger German-speaking guests. We are prepared: we have English-speaking guides and all people working in [the] tourism sector speak English too, as [do] many inhabitants.\"\nNosferatu-themed tours of Wismar with an English-speaking guide are available upon request from March through October. For an especially memorable experience, Donath recommends \u00a0requesting a guide in costume carrying a coffin. Visitors can also retrace Orlok's footsteps through a two-kilometre\u00a0self-guided walking tour\u00a0that extends from the Marktplatz square to the harbour.\nOf course, there's more to Wismar than Nosferatu. Situated at the southern tip of the Baltic Sea and a member of the Hanseatic League (a medieval network of maritime traders spread across central and northern Europe) Wismar's connection to the sea remains strong. Today, it's a major German shipbuilding hub.\nSet-jetting\nA 90-minute train whisks Nosferatu fans west from Wismar to L\u00fcbeck where more set-jetting locations await. The city's striking Salzspeicher (a collection of six gabled brick salt warehouses that have been transformed into shops) were the buildings that Count Orlok hoped to purchase, a building in the churchyard of\u00a0St Aegidien church was used as Hutter's home. Nearby, Depenau street, lined with old merchant houses, is where pallbearers carried coffins of Wisborg's plague victims. Those who have seen Eggers' remake will also recognise L\u00fcbeck's soaring seven-spired skyline in the film's establishing shot \u2013 a view you can experience yourself from St Peter's tower.\n\"The water connects, but it also divides,\" says Donath, noting how the city's position has shaped its destiny from a powerful Hanseatic port to a former Swedish territory. The city was under Swedish rule from 1648 to 1803 (a legacy still visible in its Baroque architecture) and celebrates its multicultural heritage in an annual Swedish Festival each August.\n\u00a0\nAfter tracing Orlok's footsteps through Wismar's half-timbered homes, Katharina and I hop aboard the Poeler Kogge \"Wissemara\", a floating museum that's a replica of a 14th-Century Hanseatic cog ship. These boats, carrying up to 300 tons of freight, fuelled the Hanseatic League's economic power and propelled the growth of North and Baltic Sea cities.\u00a0(The Wissemara offers a number of educational sailing journeys, including three-hour cruises of the Wismar Bay and sailing to the island of Lieps to see seals.)\nAfter learning how to tie sailing knots from the crew, I look back to the harbour. For a moment, it is easy to imagine Nosferatu's culminating scene, when Orlok's vessel drifts into Wismar's port, plague-infested rats are released and Orlok carries his coffin through the Wassertor towards Hutter's home. As the water shimmers in the late-afternoon sun and the brick-red harbour turns tangerine, I'm reminded of what Donath told me: \"We would love to share our city with more of the world.\"\u00a0\nPerhaps soon, it will.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",
