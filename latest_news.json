        "article_text": "Essex bowler Sam Cook was rested from a Championship match last month at England's request\nEngland look set to begin a defining year with one of their most inexperienced pace attacks in the past two decades when the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe is named on Friday.\nThe England hierarchy have identified the pace department as key to their success in marquee series against India and Australia, but a number of seamers will be unavailable for the one-off Test against the Zimbabweans.\nEngland's two most experienced pacemen, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes, are out injured, while there will be limited expectations for captain Ben Stokes' workload following hamstring surgery.\nThe attack will be led by Gus Atkinson, who had not made his Test debut this time last year and has 11 caps. He is likely to be joined in the squad by Matthew Potts (10 caps), Josh Tongue (two) and uncapped Essex man Sam Cook.\nA combination in the XI of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook would have 13 caps between them. Not since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago has England's pace attack looked so callow at home, when Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Richard Johnson had a combined seven caps.\nIndeed, England have played only one home Test without any of Woakes, Anderson or Stuart Broad in the past 18 years.\nAlthough Zimbabwe are improving \u2013 they have just earned a creditable 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh \u2013 England will be overwhelming favourites to win the four-day Test when it begins on 22 May.\nFollowing that, the five-match series at home to India and the Ashes away in Australia this winter will shape the leadership legacies of Stokes, coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.\n'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nWe've said naive things, but we do care - Wood\nWoakes has not played yet this season because of an ankle problem, while Wood is out until July following knee surgery.\nBrydon Carse remains sidelined with a foot problem and Olly Stone will not play before the back end of the summer after his own knee operation. Ollie Robinson, who has won 20 Test caps, has not played for England in more than a year and lost his central contract in October.\nAll-rounder Stokes, with 210 Test wickets, has more scalps than any other active England bowler, though his bowling is likely to be restricted. An injury sustained in the third Test against New Zealand in December was the second time in five months the talismanic captain had hurt his left hamstring.\nStokes will look to build his bowling in the run-up to the India series, when England will hope to have Woakes and Carse available. Jofra Archer could play his first red-ball game in four years for England Lions against India A in June. Speaking on Wednesday, Wood did not rule out a return for the conclusion of the India series.\nFor now, Atkinson will lead the attack following his stunning debut year in Test cricket while Potts played in England's last Test in New Zealand.\nTongue has not played for England for two years because of injuries but has enjoyed a superb start to the season with Nottinghamshire.\nCook, 27, has been the outstanding bowler in domestic cricket for some time, grabbing 318 first-class wickets at an average under 20.\nHe is not blessed with high pace and has had to wait for his chance, yet an indication an England call-up was on the horizon came when it was requested he be rested from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire last month.\nIf England feel they want further pace cover in the squad, it could come from 20-year-old left-armer Josh Hull, who made his Test debut last summer, or Hampshire's exciting prospect Sonny Baker. Baker has played only three first-class matches but was given an England development contract in February.\nOther areas of selection look more straightforward. Jamie Smith will return behind the stumps after missing the tour of New Zealand on paternity leave, while there is no suggestion Shoaib Bashir's place as the number one spinner is under threat.\nAny decisions over the top five will be delayed by Jacob Bethell's stint at the Indian Premier League. If batting cover is required, Jordan Cox has recovered from the broken thumb that prevented his debut in New Zealand and Durham opener Ben McKinney is highly rated.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "A charity has called for the government to commit to a date when plastic will be banned in wet wipes, to help prevent the effect they are having on the River Thames. \nThames21 says wet wipes are not only creating artificial islands, harming wildlife and impacting water quality; they are reshaping the waterway itself. \nThe charity said although plans were announced last year to ban the sale of plastic wet wipes, progress had halted following the general election. \nA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \"Plastic wet wipes clog up our sewers, pollute our waterways and harm our treasured wildlife. That is why the government will ban them.\"\nLiz Gyekye from Thames21 said: \"Wet wipes are a massive problem, it's devastating.\n\"The principal challenge is that people flush the wet wipes down the toilets, then you get sewage overflows after heavy rain that chuck them into the river.\n\"They then destroy wildlife because it ingests these microplastics when they break down.\"\nMs Gyekye said the charity wanted the government to act \"urgently\". \n\"We had the previous Conservative government last year commit to banning plastic in wet wipes, and now we're calling on this government to implement this ban,\" she said. \nAsked why the public were still flushing wet wipes despite the obvious damage being caused, Ms Gyekye said: \"I think the issue is over labels - some labels say they are 'flushable' - but there is no marine biodegradable standard out there - so they should all just go in the bin.\"\nShe added: \"Consumers need to do their part and dispose of their waste correctly, flushing down only the 3 Ps (pee, poo, and paper).\"\nThe director of sustainability at the Port of London Authority (PLA), Grace Rawnsley, said the new Thames super sewer \"should help\" cope with flushed wet wipes, but said the ban on plastic in wet wipes was \"key\" to achieving a cleaner river. \nVolunteer Janice Bruce-Brande said that although the wet wipe island she was surveying was \"soul destroying\", she had noticed a possible improvement since the introduction of the super sewer. \nBut she said it was still \"so disheartening\" to see the wet wipe problem. \nIn response to Thames21's calls, a Defra spokesperson told the BBC: \"Plastic wet wipes clog up our sewers, pollute our waterways and harm our treasured wildlife.\n\"That is why the government will ban them.\n\"This is part of our wider plan to clean up our rivers. We have passed our landmark Water Act, introducing two-year prison sentences for polluting water bosses, and banning unfair million-pound bonuses.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "One of Prince Andrew's prized business assets was administered for two years by a company controlled by the controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman, the BBC can reveal. \nAfter the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK).\nBarrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers.\nA lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".\nPitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\". \nDocuments filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.\nPrince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles.\nThe prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy.\nMr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful.\nMr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined \u00a3150,000 in 2022.\nIn January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company. \nThe National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing.\nAuthor Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"\nPitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts:\nBoth arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal.\nNonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\".\nEarlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations. \nHowever, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name.\nFounded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family.\nBut early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited.\nThis company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it. \nCorporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman. \nIn 2023, ownership of Knox House Trustees (UK) Ltd \u2013 which still owned Pitch@Palace Global - was transferred to Arthur Lancaster, an accountant who has a longstanding working relationship with both the prince and Mr Barrowman. This remains the situation today.\nThe same year Mr Lancaster took over as the sole director and shareholder of PPE Medpro. He was also a director of many of the companies involved in the AML tax avoidance case. \nThe judge in that case called him \"evasive\" and said he had \"real concerns as to the reliability of Mr Lancaster's evidence\", which contained \"significant inconsistencies\". \nAfter the case, his lawyer wrote to the court arguing that the conclusions were \"unnecessarily harsh\", that Mr Lancaster had been a \"diligent and truthful witness\", and that his efforts to provide information had been hampered by the Covid pandemic.\nFor decades the Royal Family has held investments through nominees, and still does. In the past this has served to keep details of their holdings private, though not in this case. Prince Andrew's involvement in Pitch@Palace Global is well known, and he is listed as having \"significant influence or control\" over the company on Companies House.\nMr Barrowman's lawyer said in a statement: \"Mr Lancaster was a director of KHT (UK) Ltd which provided company administration services to a number of external companies, including Pitch@Palace, a company wholly owned by the duke. Mr Lancaster acted for the duke in a personal capacity at all times and has been an associate of the duke for many years.\"\nMr Lancaster declined to comment. Prince Andrew did not respond to requests for comment.\n",

But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond. \nAhead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures. \n\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.\n\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"\nGeneral Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance. \nIn an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results. \nTariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.\nThe duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May. \nUnder the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US. \nThat share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.\nThe White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year. \nThe adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.\nIn remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a \"very, very small part of the car\" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US.\n\"We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,\" he said.  \nLast week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts. \nA letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".\nFord said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.\nThe car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".\n\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".\nStellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs. \n\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added.",

The occasion deserved more from the club to help with the atmosphere and fan engagement. \n\"Certainly if Arsenal get to this stage again, they need to be better prepared and involve the fans in the process, not just in tifos but the wider experience and build-up for the match. \n\"Hopefully we won't wait so long for another semi-final and the club will be better prepared to make more impact.\"\nBroadcaster and Arsenal fan Harry Symeou: \"I think the fans were hoping to see something with a bit more of a wow factor. Given there was lots of talk online with regards to some more elaborate, striking designs - you can understand why some felt underwhelmed.\n\"Tifos on the continent tend to be more creative and really can set the scene ahead of a huge occasion. Fan groups, in particular those known as 'ultras' normally have a big input - leading to a higher rate of fan satisfaction. But this is something we don't do well enough in English football generally. If as a club, you're going to take it upon yourselves to both plan and execute such displays, you've got to deliver something with far more imagination than that.\"\nCrystal Palace's tifo prior to their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa.\nManchester United's tifo prior to their Europa League fixture against Lyon.\nAston Villa's tifo prior to their Champions League tie with Paris St-Germain.\n1 of 3\nOn the whole?

        "article_text": "On a searing afternoon in Vietnam, Tung Linh declared she \"basically knows nothing\" about the bloody, decades-long war that pitted her country's Communist-run North against the United States-backed South.\n\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.\nStuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.\nToday's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.\nIts authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China. \nBut that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.\nVietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.\nBut it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.\nVietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).\n\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.\nIt's a dream that suits her bustling city \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.\nYou would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon. \nAnd when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.\nAmerica's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over. \nThe victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.\nBut few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".\nLinh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.\n\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.\nHer answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.\nA little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"\nWhen we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.\n\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"\nVietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.\nThe country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.\nThe ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.\nAfter the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.\n\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.\n\"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\"\nIt's no coincidence this shift began around 2018, when Trump declared his first trade war against China.\nTwo young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"\nThey plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.\nStill, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"\nVietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.\nLess than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.\nAs Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.\nBut even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.\n\"There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.\"\nBut he says he bears no anger anymore.\n\"We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.\"",

We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.\nHe said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".\nThe antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.\n\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.\n\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.\nThe 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.\nIt is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.\nCurrently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.\n\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \n\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" \nOn the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. \nThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"\nDespite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch. \n\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.\nAirbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.\nL3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.\nThe team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.\nThese annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.\n\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. \nAnother advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.\nIt is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.\n\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "The trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of the most successful rappers and music moguls in the US, starts in New York on 5 May with jury selection. \nThe charges against him include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\nThe rapper also faces dozens of lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.\nMr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".\nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.\nHis early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G.\nHis music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\nMr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand, C\u00eeroc.\nIn 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.\nIn a federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nMany of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.\nIt includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, dozens of people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nIn a hearing in New York a week before the trial, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal. \nThey said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers. \nAt the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal. \nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on 5 May.\nThe first days of the trial will be for jury selection, with the trial starting in earnest after the panel is selected. \nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public.\nAll of his court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but have not been livestreamed.\nMost federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom.\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.\nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.\nTransportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",

        "article_text": "With days left to the election, Australian opposition candidates have been wooing a crucial group that turned its back on the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election: Chinese Australian voters.\nAnd they are trying to reach them on platforms that their party once talked of banning over national security concerns: Chinese social media apps like WeChat and RedNote.\nNearly six in 10 Chinese Australians use WeChat at least once a day, according to a poll by Lowy Institute in 2022.\nGrange Chung, who is contesting the New South Wales' seat of Reid, held by the left-leaning Labor party with a 3.2% margin, said in a video on WeChat that he chose to start his career in the navy \"to give back to the country that embraced my family when we arrived with very little\".\n\"Australia gave us a home... Let me finish what I started,\" he said in a video montage that included scenes of him putting up campaign posters and interacting with the electorate.\nDespite making up just 5.5% of Australia's population, Chinese Australians were said to be a crucial to the Labor party's win in 2022, which broke nearly a decade of rule by the Liberal-National coalition. \nChinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.\nSome analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.\nAnd now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians. \nIn order to be in with a chance of winning Reid, Grange Chung knows he needs to win over the suburb of Burwood, an area often billed as Sydney's second Chinatown, with Mandarin and Cantonese dominating conversations and the signboards for shops and restaurants.\nA former commercial pilot, Chung started posting on WeChat in February and has in recent months shared his interviews with Asian business owners, Lunar New Year greetings, and his promises to the community, where about one in five voters are ethnically Chinese. One post saw him quoting Sun Tzu's philosophy.\nHe is far from the only Liberal candidate to target the platform, with University of Melbourne researcher Fan Yang finding more than 220 authorised Liberal ads had been placed on WeChat since January, compared to about 35 for Labor.\nHenry Luo, secretary of the Reid Business Community, says he has observed more \"extensive targeting\" of Chinese Australian voters in this campaign, including candidates displaying ad banners on popular WeChat accounts and collaborating with well-known Chinese celebrities or influencers.\n\"I think it is an effective platform to reach the Chinese-speaking community. We discuss and debate plenty of political issues on WeChat,\" says Mr Luo, who moved to Australia for work in 2008.\nEven non-ethnic Chinese politicians have established a presence on the platforms, sharing videos of themselves enjoying Chinese cuisine and festivals.\nLiberal MP Keith Wolohan's channel has clips of him celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with his kids and enjoying spicy Hunan food with his father. Wolohan is defending his marginal seat in Menzies, Victoria.\nBut visibility on Chinese apps is not guaranteed to translate to votes, says Qiuping Pan, a lecturer in Chinese Studies at the University of Melbourne.\nThe Chinese Australian electorate have become more \"politically mature\", she says, adding that many may instead consider voting for independent candidates, whom some believe can better advocate for local communities because they do not tow party lines.\n\"Based on the last election, they know that their votes are important and have an impact. When they are portrayed negatively, they know they can fight back,\" she says.\nSome are frustrated that the community is being \"seen merely for votes\".\n\"When Chinese Australians want to be politically involved at a deeper level, we are sometimes cast as suspicious characters,\" says Sydney resident Erin Chew.\nShe points to how Liberal senator Jane Hume recently accused Asian volunteers for independent MP Monique Ryan of being \"Chinese spies\".\n\"This sort of narrative has been normalised by politicians and the media, which is why Australia's political environment is so problematic,\" she says.\nThese are precisely the concerns that candidates want to address on their social media channels.\nIn the New South Wales' seat of Bennelong, where nearly one in three people have Chinese ancestry, Liberal contender Scott Yung has his WeChat posts overlayed with Mandarin subtitles and audio translation. \nIt is likely to help him reach more voters: English proficiency is low - at about 25% to 26% - among Australians who primarily speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home, according to government data.\nIn 2022, Labor snatched the Liberal stronghold seat for only the second time in more than 70 years. It now holds Bennelong by a razor-thin margin.\nA recent clip shows Yung, who runs an education business, stressing what he calls the \"so, so important\" relationship between China and Australia: \"It's important for Australia, it's important for Australian businesses.\"\nHow the country manages its ties with China has an everyday impact on the lives of Chinese Australians, says Osmond Chiu, a research fellow at the Victoria-based Per Capita think tank.\n\"[The community's] concerns will include increased racism, the effect on those who do business with China and what it means for people with family in China,\" he says.\nFor some voters, the Liberals' campaign blitz on social media does not sync with its anti-migrant rhetoric. \"[Coalition leader] Peter Dutton has talked about slashing migration and international student numbers. We're feeling quite anxious about it,\" says Alex Wang, who works at a restaurant in Reid.",

One post saw him quoting Sun Tzu's philosophy.He is far from the only Liberal candidate to target the platform, with University of Melbourne researcher Fan Yang finding more than 220 authorised Liberal ads had been placed on WeChat since January, compared to about 35 for Labor.BBC/Kelly NgChinese Australians often debate political issues on WeChat, says Reid community leader Henry LuoHenry Luo, secretary of the Reid Business Community, says he has observed more \"extensive targeting\" of Chinese Australian voters in this campaign, including candidates displaying ad banners on popular WeChat accounts and collaborating with well-known Chinese celebrities or influencers. \"This sort of narrative has been normalised by politicians and the media, which is why Australia's political environment is so problematic,\" she says.BBC/Kelly NgBennelong is among a handful of marginal seats in the country with a large proportion of Chinese AustraliansThese are precisely the concerns that candidates want to address on their social media channels.In the New South Wales' seat of Bennelong, where nearly one in three people have Chinese ancestry, Liberal contender Scott Yung has his WeChat posts overlayed with Mandarin subtitles and audio translation. Chinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.Some analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.And now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians.

        "article_text": "Shahida's face crumpled with grief every time she thought about the choice in front of her: Stay for love or go back to her siblings?\nShahida Adrees, now 61, moved to India from Pakistan in 2002, when she married her maternal cousin Adrees Khan, a resident of Punjab state (marriage between cousins is practised in some communities in South Asia).\nThe couple lived a peaceful, predictable life - Khan working as a driver and Shahida looking after their home and child.\nEvery few years, Shahida, who is staying in India on a long-term visa, would obtain a travel permit and make a trip to Pakistan to meet her family.\nBut that sense of routine was shattered last week when India suspended almost all visas for Pakistani citizens as part of its response to the brutal attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people. Pakistan, which denies any involvement, has hit back with tit-for-tat measures and also cancelled most visas for Indians.\nWhen Shahida heard the news, she knew what it meant; she could either go back to her siblings and other family members in Pakistan now, or stay and risk never seeing them again.\nShe chose to stay. Earlier this week, she cancelled her plans of going to Pakistan to see an ailing aunt. \"If I had gone, I wouldn't have been let back into India. But now that I am here, I don't know if I'll ever see my brothers and sisters again,\" she says.\nShahida's family is among hundreds in India and Pakistan who, with members on both sides of the borders, now face the risk of separation.\nDespite neighbours India and Pakistan sharing a hostile relationship, love stories and marriages between its citizens are not uncommon. That's because of the deeply intertwined cultural history of the countries which were partitioned along religious lines in 1947, forcing millions to leave their homes and migrate to the other side.\nThe border between the nations runs not just through the ground, but also through families - many Indians have relatives and their hometowns in Pakistan, and vice versa.\nSome, like Shahida's family, have tried to stay in touch with their roots through marriages with relatives across the border. In recent years, many couples have also met online, often overcoming insurmountable odds to stay together. \nMany of them apply for long-term visas that need to be renewed periodically while others apply for citizenship of the respective countries - but the process can take years.\nThis week, as the visa restrictions took effect, heart-breaking visuals of people - young and old couples, desperate sons and daughters, and elderly parents - pleading with authorities for help were splashed across television screens and on social media.\nThe BBC has contacted the Indian foreign ministry for comment. \n\"I came here with my mother. Now they are asking us to leave without her. How can I do that?\" mumbled a tearful Mohammed Ayat, 17.\nA Pakistani national, Ayat came to India last month to meet his maternal relatives. His mother is an Indian citizen who was living in Pakistan on a visa that is pending renewal.\nBut even as her children returned to Pakistan, she had to stay in India as she wasn't sure whether she would be allowed into the country.\n\"They can punish them [the militants], but what is our fault?\" Ayat told ANI news agency.\nThe exact number of people leaving both countries due to the latest tensions is not clear - but is estimated to run into hundreds. \nSitting in a bus that was taking her to the Attari-Wagah border, Parveen (who uses only one name), told reporters that she had lived in India for 41 years.\n\"I have no mother, brothers or sisters in Pakistan. I have nowhere to go there. I am completely helpless,\" she said.\nFamilies say the abruptness of the visa suspensions and the resulting chaos have left them feeling uncertain.\nThe restrictions imposed by Delhi exempt those like Shahida, who have been living in India on a long-term visa which needs to be renewed every few years. Valid for up to five years, these visas are given to women of Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationalities who are married to Indian citizens. \nUnder Indian rules, all long-term visa holders are allowed to visit their home country after obtaining a second permit, called the No Objection to Return to India (NORI) visa.\nBut in the days following the attack, there have been reports of NORI visa holders also being stopped from crossing the border into India, as officials waited for clarity.\nShahida says that in her case, Indian authorities have assured her that NORI visa-holders would be exempted from the restrictions. \nBut she is not willing to take the risk of leaving India.\nShe wondered if things would've been better if she had got an Indian citizenship.\n\"I did apply for it in 2009, but the file never moved. I never received a response,\" she said.\nFor Tahira Ahmed, even becoming an Indian citizen has not been enough to allay her anxieties. A Pakistani by birth, Ms Ahmed moved to Punjab state in 2003 after marrying Maqbool Ahmed, an Indian . In 2016, Tahira was granted Indian citizenship, 13 years after her marriage.\nBut she is still fearful about the prospect of being separated from her family and sent to Pakistan.\n\"Whenever tensions escalate between the two countries, our lives get caught up in the middle,\" she said. \"My own wedding was postponed for two years in 2001 when the border was closed after an attack on India's parliament.\"\nWhile they wait for answers, some couples are desperate.\nEarlier this week, BBC Punjabi met Maria Masih, a Pakistani citizen who moved to India in 2024 to marry her lover Sonu.\nThe two met through social media and knew each other for many years before they decided to get married. According to Sonu, the couple applied for a long-term visa for Maria immediately after their wedding. But their application is still under process. Maria is now seven months pregnant.\n\"I want to live here. I don't want to go back. Please give me a visa and let me stay,\" a forlorn Maria told reporters earlier this week.\nThe couple has since reportedly been absconding and an investigation is under way.\nMiles away, Ms Ahmed wonders if one can really blame them or anyone for trying to escape.\n\"What is their fault anyway? They came here for love,\" she said.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Cristina Horez, an influencer from the Northern city of Iasi \nRomanians are returning to the polls this weekend, following the unprecedented cancellation of presidential elections last December which fuelled protests and nationwide turmoil.\nFar-right candidate Calin Georgescu's shock victory in the first round of elections was annulled amid accusations of Russian interference, suspicious TikTok accounts and secret payments to online influencers. Moscow denied interfering in the election.\nGeorgescu is now banned from running, and was detained, facing a criminal investigation including attempting to overthrow constitutional order. He has denied the charges and accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify stealing the election\".\nThe leader of Romania's far-right AUR party, George Simion, has been polling as the frontrunner in the first round of the election re-run on Sunday.\nHe is followed in the polls by Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party and independent candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan.\nAt the centre of this unprecedented political crisis are TikTok influencers accused by the Romanian authorities of participating in social media campaigns which artificially boosted Georgescu's online presence. The BBC has spoken to some of them.\nProtesters took to the streets in March, after it was announced Georgescu couldn't run in the May elections. \nPro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu's victory in the first round of elections came as a surprise.\nGeorgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%. \nHe declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning. \nInstead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote.\nAn independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\".\nAuthorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign.\nThe authorities said that one of these campaigns was \"identical\" to an operation \"run by the Russian Federation in Ukraine\".\nSeparately, declassified intelligence documents also stated that Russia carried out \"cyberattacks, leaks, and sabotage\" in Romania.\nBut authorities still haven't provided any concrete evidence of Russian interference in the election, frustrating many Romanians. \nThe Foreign Intelligence Services and Romanian Police declined to comment on ongoing investigations.\nCalin Georgescu has been barred from running in May's re-run of the election\nShortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\". \nThey did not name a specific candidate.\nThey had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it. \nFameUp declined to comment to the BBC.\nCristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\".\nSome influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned.\nWhile the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescu\u2026 I was absolutely surprised.\"\nThe comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\".\nIt is still not clear who created these bot accounts.\nExperts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds.\nA TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\".\n\"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said.\nThe uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January. \nThe Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections. \nIn response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu.\nRomeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents\nThen, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money.\nThe prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts. \nHis lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\".\nWe spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts. \nHe says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok \u2013 along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle \u2013 have been removed.\nElgi says his content wasn't about the election, but about manele music, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu.\nElgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\"\nMuch is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election.\nIt's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity.\n\"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\"\nAdditional reporting by Georgiana Tudor and Oana Marocico.",

        "article_text": "Famous for its adorable quokkas, Rottnest Island has become a global favourite. But beyond the selfies lies a rich, complex story of culture, conservation and community.\nOn a recent visit to Perth, I mentioned to a local that I was heading to Rottnest Island the next day. She sighed wistfully. \"I love it there,\" she said. \"You're going to love it too. It has a special kind of magic \u2013 the kind of place where you kick off your shoes the minute you arrive. Everything slows down and you can breathe a little more deeply.\"\nI already felt that Perth was a little like that \u2013 at least, life there felt slower and less frenzied than in my hometown of Melbourne on Australia's east coast \u2013 but I smiled back, not really knowing what she meant.\nHowever, she was right. Rottnest Island, a peaceful 19-sq-km isle off the coast of Western Australia, is, in fact, magical. The spell was cast as soon as our ferry left the mainland, skimming over the Indian Ocean. Humpback whales breached nearby, sending jets of sea spray into the air and flipping their tails as if in welcome. The sky was clear with the promise of a perfect day to come.\nJust 19km and 30 minutes later, I stepped off the ferry into another world. Rottnest Island has been famously car-free since 1931, and those more in the know than me immediately jumped onto bikes they'd brought with them or wandered off to hire one from Pedal and Flipper, said to be the largest bike hire place in the southern hemisphere.\nKids zoomed around in packs, dodging groups of tourists ambling through the main settlement. Some people had fishing rods under one arm; others, surfboards strapped to their bikes. Families stopped at the bakery for a flat white and vanilla slice before heading off to explore the island's 63 beaches and 20 bays, many with evocative names like Little Parakeet Bay and Cathedral Rocks that in no way came close to capturing the grandeur of the scenery in real life.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nThere was no urban noise, no traffic and nothing to worry about. It was idyllic and glorious and everything I imagined a nostalgic care-free (and car-free) island holiday to be.\nThe isle has long been a cherished playground for generations of Western Australian families. \"Rottnest is very, very special, particularly to the people of Perth, like me,\" explained Paul Campbell, a volunteer guide I met not long after I arrived. Campbell spent his childhood holidays on Rottnest and now returns regularly to tell people about his beloved island. \"There are no multi-storey high-rise hotels here,\" he added. \"There is no private ownership. If you ever tried to put a multi-storey-anything here for wealthy people, you would be absolutely torn to shreds. We are very protective of our beautiful island.\"\nOnce a well-kept secret from the rest of the world, in recent years Rottnest has become one of Australia's most Instagrammed destinations, thanks to a certain fuzzy-faced resident: the quokka.\nIn 2013, Huffington Post dubbed the quokka \"the happiest animal in the world\", and the internet responded in glee. Quokkas \u2013 tiny marsupials found only in this small pocket of south-western Australia \u2013 seem to smile for selfies in a way that feels almost staged. Tennis star Roger Federer to actress Margot Robbie were among the first celebrities to pose with the infamous animal, helping spark a wave of global attention. Then in 2019 came Chris Hemsworth's now-iconic #QuokkaSelfie\u00a0with Matt Damon, which racked up more than four million likes. \"Rotto\", as locals call it, became the hottest ticket in town, transforming from local secret to global sensation. According to the Rottnest Island Authority, annual visitor numbers have nearly tripled in the last decade, peaking at more than 800,000 at last count.\nWhat's in a name?\nThe island was first sighted by Dutch explorers in the 17th Century and was named by one such captain, Wallem de Vlamingh, who stayed on the island for six days and mistook the quokkas for rats. He referred the island as \"'t elyandt 't rottenest\" which means \"rat's nest island\" in Dutch \u2013 although by all accounts he was also captivated by the pristine scenery and referred to it as \"paradise on Earth\" in his journal.\nRottnest, once simple and sleepy, has had to quickly grow up to meet the demands of all these domestic and international tourists. That meant creating more accommodation than the basic cabins and camping that existed, as well as better food and activity options. And what it has done is exemplary, transforming into a model of eco-conscious tourism without losing its soul.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs Campbell put it: \"When I was nine years old, the [cultural] experience that I had on Rottnest is not that much different to what you're going to experience today.\"\u00a0\nYou won't find any private cars here \u2013 just a few vehicles for rangers and staff \u2013\u00a0so most everyone gets about on two wheels or two feet (or the odd skateboard, scooter or Segway), having to occasionally dodge quokkas lounging on the road. Accommodation ranges from beachside cottages with bike racks out front to backpacker dorms to relaxed boutique hotels. While many tourists come on a day trip from Perth, it's much better to stay the night: quokkas are nocturnal and will spend most of the day sleeping under shady bushes. In addition, most day-trippers leave by 16:30, at which point the island truly comes into its own.\n\"Someone once said to me that you can feel the island exhale [when they leave],\" said Erin Gallagher from the Rottnest Island Authority. \"I just thought it was the most beautiful thing \u2013 and it's so true.\"\nI was staying at Discovery Resorts, the island's first eco resort, whose 83 glamping tents are shaded by gum trees and Aleppo pines, tucked behind Pinky Beach in the sand dunes. My tent had no aircon or TV, just a ceiling fan for airflow and the sound of the ocean through canvas walls. It was perfect in its simplicity. \"[The resort] is designed to immerse guests into the environment,\" explained Krizza Miclat, the resort's sales and event manager. \"A lot of the infrastructure is elevated on steel poles to ensure that we're not damaging the sand dunes. So, if ever we were to pick up and move, we haven't impacted it too much.\"\nIn fact, nearly everything here works in harmony with the natural environment. Renewable energy is provided by the Indian Ocean's sea breezes and the strong Western Australian sun; while drinking water is drawn from the sweeping white semi-circle of\u00a0Longreach Bay, desalinated and filtered. Marine sanctuary zones below water mean world-class snorkelling and diving, and an island nursery grows native plants from locally sourced cuttings and seeds. In 2023, a new management plan reaffirmed Rottnest's commitment to sustainability, conservation and culture.\u00a0\n\"We're always striving to improve,\" said Gallagher. \"Our target is to achieve 75% renewables. There's even an app where anyone can see how much power the island is generating in real time.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A day out with Bluey: Australia's new experience brings the Heeler family to life\n\u2022 Bindi Irwin's top outdoor adventures in Australia\n\u2022 The hike making Australia a better place \nIn the spirit of low-impact activities, I decided to take a Segway tour around the undulating landscape, rolling along the endless beaches, gliding past the cluster of salt lakes in the north-eastern corner and looking out for whales on the island's Humpback Highway. I steered past the scrub heath that covers much of the island, breathing in its signature salty-sweet smell and dodging prickle lily and feather speargrass. The island is just 11km long and 4.5km at its widest point, but its biodiversity is vast \u2013 a Class A reserve where everything from the blue-flowered Rottnest daisy to the long, black king skink I saw on the side of a trail is protected.\nBut not all scenes here are so idyllic.\nIn 1838, Rottnest was turned into an Aboriginal prison. Over the next century, more than 4,000 Indigenous men and boys were incarcerated here for \"crimes\" that they often didn't know they'd committed. Some were as young as eight years old. Many never returned home.\nPlan your trip:\nGet there: Regular ferries are operated by Sealink and Rottnest Express (leaving from Perth CBD and Fremantle) and Rottnest Fast Ferries (leaving from Hillarys Boat Harbour, north of Perth CBD).\nWhen to go: Summer (December-February)\u00a0is the most popular (and crowded) time, but September-April is still warm enough for water-based activities. If you want to celebrate quokka joeys taking their first hops, visit 21-22 September 2025 for Little Quokka's Big Birthday Weekend.\nWhere to stay: Book an eco-glamping tent at Discovery Resorts or stay at the newly opened The Lodge Wadjemup.\nEat: Frankies for pizzas and salads; Sunset snacks and drinks at Pinky's; The Lane for craydogs (a spicy crayfish-stuffed roll); Isola for more upmarket fare.\nDo: Hire a bike, snorkel and mask from Pedal and Flipper to explore the island at your own pace. Head to Garden Lake at sunset for epic quokka sightings. Take a guided Segway tour to learn about the island's history as you explore.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt's a dark legacy that the island is only beginning to address. As I wobbled my Segway back to the main settlement, we passed what looked like an ordinary field. But, my tour guide explained, it is a place of immense significance: the\u00a0Wadjemup Aboriginal Burial Ground\u00a0where 373 unmarked graves of prisoners were uncovered, with the first discoveries made during construction work in the 1970s. Shockingly, holidaymakers continued to camp on the site until the practice was finally banned in 2007.\n\"It was the largest number of Aboriginal deaths in custody in history in Australia,\" explained volunteer guide Anne Yardley, when I met her later at the island's Wadjemup Museum. \"And from the biggest number of Aboriginal nations.\"\nBut Indigenous connection to the island stretches far beyond this painful chapter. Long before European settlement, the island was part of the mainland, and archaeological evidence shows that the Noongar people lived on and used the island for tens of thousands of years. Its Indigenous name \u2013 Wadjemup \u2013 means \"place of spirits\".\n\"This was a significant place for Indigenous people,\" Campbell told me. \"Ceremonies were held here. But about 6,500 years ago, sea levels rose and this patch of land became an island. The Aboriginal people stayed on the mainland and it was left alone for thousands of years\u2026 all through Christianity, the Roman Empire, the Egyptian Empire\u2026 until Europeans arrived.\"\nToday, Wadjemup is working to tell this fuller story. The small but compelling Wadjemup Museum has been revamped; while walking trails such as the 45km\u00a0Wadjemup Bidi\u00a0\u2013 made up of five connected trails and built in part by volunteers \u2013 connects visitors to historical and cultural sites across the landscape, with interpretive signage and installations by Noongar artists. The\u00a0Wadjemup Project, an Aboriginal-led initiative, focusses on acknowledging Wadjemup's history of Aboriginal incarceration and the memorialisation of former prison sites.\nVolunteers play a huge part, too, from the Winnit Club, formed in 1931 by a group of regular campers, to the yellow-shirted Rottnest Volunteer Guides. These and other groups collectively contribute more than 40,000 hours a year to maintaining the island, and their dedication to preserving and sharing its stories speaks volumes about how deeply the island is loved.\n\"There's this balancing act between having enough people to make the place work financially, but not so many people coming here that you lose the reason to come,\" said Campbell. \"It is a very, very special place.\"\u00a0\nI certainly felt that on my visit. One moment I was riding my bike past salt lakes ringed with grey saltbush and coastal pigface, the next watching irresistibly cute quokkas hop around at sunset. I snorkelled an underwater trail through turquoise shallows, gazed onto shipwrecks just offshore and had sunset drinks looking out to incredible ocean vistas. I even tried to get my own quokka selfie, respecting the signs not to feed or touch them in any way but to keep my distance and let them come to me. I laughed as I tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to get both myself and a quokka fully in shot, and was reminded of something Gallagher had said to me about the smiling-faced marsupial: \"Why wouldn't you be happy if this is where you lived?\"\nIt was more than just a line \u2013 it was a truth that settled into the bones of the island. Rottnest may be famous now, but it hasn't lost what makes it feel like a local secret: the sense that once you arrive, you can slow down, breathe deeply and kick off your shoes for a while.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The latest in the superhero franchise \"is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun\", with a \"charismatic\" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber.\nEver since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end.\nThe Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called \"Infinity Saga\" \u2013 the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.\nThe key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods.\nThere's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong \u2013 but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep.\nDe Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better.\nThunderbolts*\nDirector: Jake Schreier\nCast: Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Pierce, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nRuntime: 2hr 16min\nOne small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A combat epic that 'does what film does best'\n\u2022 Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis'\n\u2022 Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' \nThe underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts \u2013 and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes.\u00a0\nAt both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion \u2013 and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre.\u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "summary": "Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong \u2013 but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. Thunderbolts* review: 'The greatest Marvel offering in years'22 hours agoShareSaveNicholas BarberShareSaveDisneyThe latest in the superhero franchise \"is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun\", with a \"charismatic\" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber.Ever since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.The key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun.",

(He would go on to say that he really didn't care who won.)\nInstead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.\nThe irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney. \nWhile Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.\nA Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. It would have represented what many in Trump's orbit like to believe is a global movement toward their brand of culturally conservative, anti-elite, anti-immigration, and pro-working-class politics.\n\nAlthough Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge. \nAlready there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.\nCarney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.\nThe Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.\nMeanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.\nCarney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test.",

Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. )Instead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.",

If convicted, he could face life in prison.\nThe rapper also faces dozens of lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.\nMr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".\nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.\nHis early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G.\nHis music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\nMr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand, C\u00eeroc.\nIn 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.\nIn a federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nMany of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.\nIt includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, dozens of people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nIn a hearing in New York a week before the trial, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal. \nThey said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers. \nAt the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal. \nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on 5 May.\nThe first days of the trial will be for jury selection, with the trial starting in earnest after the panel is selected. \nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public.\nAll of his court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but have not been livestreamed.\nMost federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom.\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.\nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.\nTransportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",

where many of the nation's biggest museums were historically located - was in 2021, when the award was ultimately won by Firstsite in Colchester, Essex.\nWaldman added she hoped this year's award would \"inspire\" people to visit some \"remarkable places\" in their local region and help them \"discover the powerful role they can play in our lives.\"\nWhichever one of the five museums wins will succeed last year's winner, the Young V&A in London.",

        "article_text": "The model of football that has come to define our era - often associated with Pep Guardiola, who expanded on what he learned from Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal - is not only the most prominent today, but also the one shaping the present and future of the game.\nGuardiola didn't invent 'juego de posicion' - or positional football - but he developed it further than anyone before him, laying the foundation for a new cultural framework. And whether we like it or not, it has already taken over.\nIndeed, three of Guardiola's disciples - Luis Enrique, Mikel Arteta and Hansi Flick - find themselves in this week's Champions League semi-finals. The Guardiola way will again be on show at the business end of Europe's biggest club competition.\nThere has been growing resistance to this model. Critics argue that it turns players into robots, removes spontaneity and asks defenders to behave like midfielders.\nSome fans and pundits feel it's overcoached, overly structured, and lacking the chaos and excitement of \"real football\".\nBut perhaps that resistance is missing the broader picture - or reacting not to the model itself, but to poor implementations of it.\nLet's look at the facts. Five of the eight Champions League quarter-finalists this season played a version of positional football. Clubs across Europe - even traditional powerhouses like Liverpool and, eventually, Manchester United under Ruben Amorim - are gravitating towards it.\nIt produces brilliant games, particularly in European competition, where elite coaches and players amplify its potential. More than just a style, it's a winning model.\nMost importantly, it's a cultural force. Clubs are hiring managers who believe in it, academies are shaping players to fit it, and football education globally is being reoriented around it.\nNot everyone gets it right. But that's always been true in football. Not every team in the 1970s could play like Nottingham Forest or Liverpool - but many tried, because those styles defined their time. Every era has a prevailing model, and it's natural that most teams move towards it.\nWe're emerging from a footballing culture best summarised as: structured at the back, freedom up front. In other words, we train the defence and leave the attack to the imagination of the forwards.\nThat's changing, but cultural shifts take time. The new footballing paradigm is settling in, but hasn't fully taken hold yet.\nMikel Arteta (left) was Pep Guardiola's assistant at Manchester City\nThe attacking phase can be broken down into three stages: the build-up, the construction and the finishing. The French even refer to an additional phase - the preparation of the final pass - which sits between construction and finishing. But for the purpose of this discussion, let's stick with three.\nWhen Guardiola began coaching in 2001, his focus was on the build-up phase. The famous conversation with Victor Valdes, in which Valdes thought his manager had gone mad for asking him to pass to centre-backs who didn't want the ball, is now part of football folklore. A landmark moment in the evolution of the game.\nAfter the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, and especially following the rule change in 2019 that allowed players to receive the ball from a goal-kick from inside the penalty area, training the build-up phase became not just common practice, but a fundamental pillar of modern football.\nThe construction phase - managing the middle third - has taken longer to spread, but Guardiola had already started developing it at Barcelona, and refined it further at Bayern Munich and Manchester City.\nThe finishing phase, however - the final act of an attacking move - remains largely unorganised. Football still hasn't figured out how to fully systematise it. The culture of the game, among players and coaches alike, isn't quite ready for it. But one day, a new revolutionary will come along and advance that final phase. That's the history of football.\nFor now, we have brilliant practitioners perfecting the model as it stands - as well as the three semi-finalists, Unai Emery and even Enzo Maresca are two more. Roberto de Zerbi had started to push the boundaries, but his progress has stalled.\n\"Pep has been a reference for all of us who want to play football in a certain way\u2026 You always learn by watching his teams play. Always,\" said Paris St-Germain manager Luis Enrique.\n\"Working alongside him changed the way I see football. He gave me the tools to be a coach,\" said Arsenal's Arteta.\n\"Pep influenced me a lot. He has an incredible ability to organise the game, to control space and to constantly find new solutions. Watching him train Bayern was an eye-opener. He's one of the greatest thinkers football has ever had,\" added Barcelona's Flick.\nLuis Enrique's PSG beat Pep Guardiola's Manchester City 4-2 in this season's Champions League\nMuch of the criticism towards positional football is rooted in frustration: \"If we can't do it well, let's not do it at all.\"\nBut that's not how progress works. Just because only the top teams can currently execute the model exceptionally well doesn't mean it's flawed. It means we're watching football in transition. The conversation shouldn't be \"this doesn't work\", rather \"how can we implement it better?\"\nIt's easy to romanticise the past, to argue that football used to be more spontaneous, more human. But the truth is football today is better. More complex, more collective, more intelligently designed. It's harder to coach, harder to play and, when done well, arguably more beautiful to watch.\nThat's why managers like Emery are so fascinating. He challenged his own beliefs, read the evolution of the game and adapted. He embraced positional principles not because of ideology, but because they offered greater control, clarity and consistency - even without elite-level players.\nThat kind of flexibility is brave. Not every manager can do it. Not every player can either. But I admire clubs that choose to live in the now, rather than clinging to what worked then.\nWhy shouldn't defenders like Virgil van Dijk, Pau Torres or Pau Cubarsi touch the ball more than midfielders? Why can't they be the architects of the play? Why can't they be the role models for a new generation of defenders?\nEven PSG, a club historically reliant on individual brilliance, has adopted positional ideas in attack - making sure they're prepared to press the instant they lose the ball.\nThe hardest thing in football, as in life, is to look forward and imagine what's next. It's far easier to look back and say \"that was better\".\nI don't pretend to know what football will look like in a decade. But I listen to those who do. And I believe positional play is the present - and the future.\nWe are in the middle of a cultural shift. Some managers are trying to copy the model. Some are succeeding. Others are still learning. And yes, some are resisting altogether.\nBut in five years almost everyone will be playing some version of positional football. Not because they'll be forced to, but because football doesn't wait for those who refuse to evolve.\nThe next generation of coaches is already fluent in its language. And soon it will be universal.\nWe're not asking every restaurant to be Michelin-starred. But we are asking them to stop serving frozen food.\nLet's not fight the model. Let's enjoy the process. Let's celebrate the teams trying to get it right - mixing structure with their own cultural identity - instead of dismissing them because they're not Guardiola's City.\nA new football culture has taken over - and it's here to stay.\nThis video can not be played\n'PSG worry me more than Real Madrid'\nA beautiful story but we want much more - Arteta\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

Local pastor Ian Wilkinson survived after weeks of treatment in hospital.\nThe jury has been shown text messages exchanged between Simon and Erin Patterson the day before the deadly mushroom lunch.\nMr Patterson said in court Thursday he felt \"too uncomfortable\" about attending the lunch.\nErin Patterson responded: \"That's really disappointing. I've spent many hours this week preparing lunch for tomorrow... It's important to me that you're all there tomorrow and that I can have the conversations that I need to have.\"\nThe prosecution alleges Ms Patterson invited the group to lunch \"on the pretence she'd been diagnosed with cancer\".\nThe court in Morwell, regional Victoria, heard that between the couple's marriage in 2007 and separation in 2015, there were a number of periods of separation and reconciliation - including Erin Patterson leaving her husband and their baby son in the middle of a road trip across Australia in 2009.\nMr Patterson had to drive from Townsville to Perth - a distance of about 5,000 km (3,100 miles) - alone with the child, he told the court.\nThe couple met in 2002, while both working at Monash City Council, where Mr Patterson was a civil engineer.\nAsked about his wife, Mr Patterson said: \"Erin is very intelligent.\n\"Some of the things that attracted me to her in the first place is definitely her intelligence. She's quite witty and can be quite funny.\"\nAsked about how his wife got on with his parents, Don and Gail Patterson, Mr Patterson said: \"She especially got on with dad. They shared a love of knowledge and learning in the world.\"\nWith his voice faltering, Mr Patterson added: \"I think she loved his gentle nature.\"\nHe said Ms Patterson held a university degree in business and accounting, and was also qualified as an air traffic controller having worked at Melbourne's Tullemarine airport.\nMr Patterson is due in court again on Friday to take more questions from prosecutors.\nMr Patterson painted a picture of a relationship peppered with periods of separation - the first within the first two years of marriage - at one point becoming emotional and asking for tissues.\nAfter the final separation there was a lot of communication by text message he said, including \"banter\" and talk about politics, he said.\nBut there was a change in the relationship in 2022 when Ms Patterson was \"upset\" when her husband listed himself as separated on his tax return.\nThe \"chatty nature\" of their relationship \"pretty much stopped\" after this, Mr Patterson said - with communication now only about the \"practical management\" of their family life.\nWearing a navy suit, white shirt and purple tie, he told the court that Ms Patterson received a \"substantial inheritance\" from her grandmother which Mr Patterson estimated at A$2m ($1.3m; \u00a3964,000) - though it was not paid in a lump sum and was \"dribbled out\" by the executors of the estate.\nThe jury has heard that there is no dispute that the lunch of beef wellington, mashed potatoes and green beans contained death cap mushrooms and caused the guests' illnesses.\nWhether Ms Patterson intended to kill or cause very serious injury is the main issue in the case, the judge has told the jury.\n\nThe court heard the couple had married in 2007 and had two children together - though separated permanently in 2015 .\nThey had remained \"amicable\" including sharing family holidays, though there was a falling out over child support payments in 2022, the jury was told.\nDuring the prosecution's opening statement on Wednesday, lead barrister Nanette Rogers said the jury would hear evidence that Ms Patterson had travelled to a location, near her home in Leongatha, where death cap mushroom sightings had been logged on a naturalist website.\nAnd in the days after the lunch, she took a number of steps to \"conceal\" what she had done, the prosecution alleged.\nThere'd be evidence that she lied to investigators about the source of the mushrooms in the dish - saying some had come from an Asian grocery in Melbourne and she had never foraged wild ones. And she made a trip to a local dump to dispose of a food dehydrator prosecutors say she used to prepare the toxic meal.\nMs Patterson's barrister has said she did not deliberately serve poisoned food to her guests.\n\"The defence case is that she panicked because she was overwhelmed by the fact that these four people had become so ill because of the food she had served them.\"\nThe court heard how Mr Patterson spoke to his father the morning after the lunch and discovered both his parents had been up since midnight with vomiting and diahorrea and that they had called an ambulance.\nAnd after trying to call his aunt and uncle, Heather and Ian Wilkinson, he went to their home when they did not answer.\n\"Ian answered the door. He looked grey and spooked,\" Mr Patterson recalled. \"Yeah, he was struggling.\n\"I said 'How are you?' He said 'Not good'.\"\nMr Patterson then saw Heather Wilkinson sitting on the couch, he told the court.\n\"She looked pretty crook. She had a container as a spew bucket, \" he said.\nAfter Mr Wilkinson left the room, Heather spoke to him, he confirmed, under questioning from prosecutor Dr Rogers.\n\"We didn't have much conversation, but she was puzzled and she said 'I noticed Erin served herself her food on a coloured plate which was different to the rest'.\"\n\"I acknowledged I'd heard her, but did not progress it as a conversation,\" he added.\nBecause he had been told an ambulance would have taken an hour to arrive, Mr Patterson drove the couple to hospital in the Wilkinsons' car when Heather Wilkinson raised the subject once more.\n\"She mentioned the coloured plate again, She asked me 'Is Erin short of crockery? Is that why she would have this different coloured plate that she served herself with?\" Mr Patterson said.\n\"I can't remember the exact phrase but it was something like that.\nAnd what did you reply, the prosecutor asked?\n\"I said yes, Erin doesn't have that many plates and that may be the reason.\"\nMr Patterson became emotional again, describing going to see his parents at Korumburra hospital where they were in the same room but separate beds.\n\"Dad was substantially worse than mum. He was really struggling,\" he said fighting back tears..\n\"He was lying on his side. He was hunched quite noticeably, with a really discoloured face, struggling to speak.\n\"Speaking was an effort, taking the energy to speak was an effort and his voice was strained in a way that he wasn't right inside.

        "article_text": "Liverpool FC's victory at the weekend has clinched them their second Premier League title but it also resulted in something curious \u2013 producing a strange series of numbers in the league's record books.\nSomething remarkable has just happened in English football. Liverpool FC have been crowned Premier League champions for a second time. When added to their 18 pre-Premier League titles, it means they now equal Manchester United's record of being English champions 20 times. But while fans of the club will no doubt be celebrating this moment of triumph, another astounding facet of their achievement has caught the attention of mathematicians.\nLiverpool's title win has completed the opening of an exceptional set of numbers that has been 33 years in the making. The sequence emerges when we rank Liverpool alongside the other clubs that have won the Premier League since it was first formed in 1992, listing them by the number of titles won, starting with the lowest. As you can see in the table below, the number of Premier League titles goes as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.\nTo the untrained eye, this sequence might not seem significant. But it will be enough to get many maths aficionados excited. They will recognise this as\u00a0the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the previous two in the sequence.\nThe sequence can be found in an astonishing array of places \u2013 from the spirals of seeds on\u00a0sunflower heads\u00a0and the bracts of\u00a0pinecones\u00a0to\u00a0family tree patterns in some species of animals.\nFibonacci sequences (sequences in the plural because starting with a different pair of initial numbers and following the rule of adding consecutive numbers to generate the next gives you a different, but related sequence) were first\u00a0introduced to European science in 1202 by Leonardo of Pisa, also known by his nickname Fibonacci (meaning son of\u00a0Bonaccio).\nLong before Fibonacci popularised the sequences in his book Liber Abaci, however, the sequences had been known to Indian Mathematicians. They had drawn upon the sequences to help them enumerate the number of possible poems of a given length, using short syllables of one-unit duration and long syllables of two-unit duration. The Indian poet/mathematicians knew that you could make a poem of length n by taking a poem of length n-1 and adding a short syllable or a poem of length n-2 and adding a long syllable. Consequently, they figured out that to work out the number of poems of a given length you just had to add the number of poems that were one syllable shorter to the number that were two syllables shorter \u2013 the exact rule we use today to define a Fibonacci sequence.\nHidden in the sequences is another important and related mathematical mainstay \u2013 the golden ratio. As the terms in a Fibonacci sequence get larger, the ratio of each term to the one preceding it gets closer and closer to the golden ratio \u2013 approximated to 1.61803 by the first few places in its decimal expansion. The golden ratio is hypothesised to govern the arrangement of leaves on the stem of some plant species and supposedly leads to aesthetically pleasing results when applied in art, architecture and music.\nFibonacci sequences are often held up by mathematicians as exemplars of the beauty of mathematics. They can provide vivid visual examples of maths written into the patterns of the real world, without which many non-mathematicians can struggle to understand the elegance we see in our subject. In our over-enthusiasm to proselytise, however, there is a temptation to cast Fibonacci sequences or the golden ratio as some sort of all-encompassing natural law governing phenomena across orders of magnitude, from the spiral shapes of nautilus shells to vortices of hurricanes to the curved arms of galaxies.\nIn reality, although these natural features are aesthetically pleasing, very few of them conform to the rules of the Fibonacci sequence or exhibit the golden ratio. We must be careful that we don't try to shoehorn every beautiful pattern into the delicate Fibonacci glass slipper \u2013 to suggest causation and impose meaning where there is none.\nIt's extraordinary, then, to find the Fibonacci sequence cropping up in a place as unexpected as the Premier League. When, as scientists, we spot a well-known sequence like this appearing seemingly out of the blue, we should start to ask ourselves whether it tells us anything important about the process that generated the sequence. Is there some surprising unseen process underlying Premier League title battles or is it nothing more than a cute coincidence? Just because we can see a Fibonacci sequence in something doesn't mean it is there for a reason.\nNonetheless, spotting these sorts of seeming coincidences can be extremely useful for the process of scientific discovery. In 1912, for example, Alfred Wegener noticed the apparently strange coincidence that the coastline of West Africa and the eastern coastline of South America seemed to fit together like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Despite the prevailing opinion at the time, that the enormous land masses of the continents were just too big to move, Wegener proposed the only theory that reconciled his observations. Continental drift suggested that the land masses weren't rooted in place but could, ever-so-slowly, change their relative positions on the surface of the Earth.\nMore like this:\u00a0\nWhen Wegener published his theory in 1915, he became a laughing stock. Geologists rejected his outlandish idea, citing a lack of mechanism for moving such enormous chunks of the Earth's surface, dismissing the seemingly snug tessellation of the continents as pure coincidence. By the 1960s, however, the theory of plate tectonics \u2013 the movement of the solid mantle and crust over the Earth's surface \u2013 gave credence to Wegener's now widely accepted theories.\nAlthough coincidences can point the way to new scientific discoveries, they can also prove an obstacle to scientific progress when they appear to confirm an incorrect theory. In the early 1800s German anatomist Johann Friedrich Meckel made just such a blunder. He was a believer in scala naturae (the ladder of nature) in which humans sit above all other animals in an ordered but static hierarchy. The simplest, most primitive life forms were supposed to sit on the lowest rungs of the ladder, while the most complex and advanced beings resided on the highest. His views were hardly surprising given that this \"great chain of being\" was the predominant theory of the day. The now generally accepted theory of \"common descent\" \u2013 that multiple species descend from a single ancestral population \u2013 was only in its infancy as an idea at the time.\nMeckel employed scala naturae to come up with a conjecture about his area of speciality \u2013 embryonic development. Known as recapitulation theory, he posited that, as they developed, the embryos of higher order animals (like mammals) progressed successively through forms which strongly resembled the \"less perfect\" animals, like fish, amphibians and reptiles, on lower rungs of the ladder. One startling, but seemingly unlikely prediction of this theory was that, as humans progressed through the \"fish stage\", their embryos would have gill slits.\nAs it happens, it was discovered in 1827 that human embryos really do have slits that resemble gills at an early stage of development. This extraordinary finding seemed to bear out Meckel's prediction and corroborate his recapitulation theory. So strong was the perceived evidence that the theory became widely accepted, and it wasn't until almost 50 years later in the 1870s that the recapitulation theory of development was finally put to bed for good as the idea of common descent started to take hold. Common descent underpins what we now know as modern evolutionary theory. It made clear that, far from undergoing a \"fish stage\" in the womb, the gill slits were a consequence of the fact that, sharing a common ancestor with fish, we also share much of their DNA and early developmental processes.\nSometimes coincidences can lead scientists astray, seeming to point to one conclusion when, in fact, there is an alternative explanation for the observations that is better supported by the facts.\nSo what does the fact that the beautiful, almost mystical Fibonacci sequence has cropped up in the data on the number of Premier League title wins mean for the beautiful game? With no plausible mechanism which could have given rise to the sequence, the answer is almost certainly nothing.\nIt's wonderful to have spotted this mathematical sequence in such an unlikely place, giving us a chance to reflect upon the importance of Fibonacci numbers. But a pattern doesn't always mean causality \u2013 a coincidence is sometimes just a coincidence.\nAnd, just like Meckel's gill slits, its appearance in the Premier League records is just that \u2013 nothing more than a spectacular but ultimately misleading coincidence.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

They will recognise this as\u00a0the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the previous two in the sequence.The sequence can be found in an astonishing array of places \u2013 from the spirals of seeds on\u00a0sunflower heads\u00a0and the bracts of\u00a0pinecones\u00a0to\u00a0family tree patterns in some species of animals.Fibonacci sequences (sequences in the plural because starting with a different pair of initial numbers and following the rule of adding consecutive numbers to generate the next gives you a different, but related sequence) were first\u00a0introduced to European science in 1202 by Leonardo of Pisa, also known by his nickname Fibonacci (meaning son of\u00a0Bonaccio).Long before Fibonacci popularised the sequences in his book Liber Abaci, however, the sequences had been known to Indian Mathematicians. It made clear that, far from undergoing a \"fish stage\" in the womb, the gill slits were a consequence of the fact that, sharing a common ancestor with fish, we also share much of their DNA and early developmental processes.Sometimes coincidences can lead scientists astray, seeming to point to one conclusion when, in fact, there is an alternative explanation for the observations that is better supported by the facts.So what does the fact that the beautiful, almost mystical Fibonacci sequence has cropped up in the data on the number of Premier League title wins mean for the beautiful game? Consequently, they figured out that to work out the number of poems of a given length you just had to add the number of poems that were one syllable shorter to the number that were two syllables shorter \u2013 the exact rule we use today to define a Fibonacci sequence.Hidden in the sequences is another important and related mathematical mainstay \u2013 the golden ratio.

        "article_text": "Miami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Dates: 2-4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary of practice and qualifying online and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra; race on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nFormula 1 heads to the United States this weekend for the Miami Grand Prix, the sixth round of the 2025 world championship.\nLast time out in Saudi Arabia, McLaren's Oscar Piastri won his third race of the season to take the lead in the drivers' standings. \nA year ago, Miami was the scene of Lando Norris' first F1 victory.\nBefore this year's race, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.\nWould it be fair to say Lando Norris is faster than Oscar Piastri, but Piastri is a better racing driver? \u2013 Rob\nThe comparison between McLaren team-mates Norris and Piastri - as drivers, and as personalities - is one of many interesting aspects of this season.\nThat's because they are such contrasting people. Piastri is the epitome of robustness. Nothing seems to faze him. Even the weekends when he is a little off Norris' pace he seems to take in his stride. As Max Verstappen pointed out in Jeddah, he is very \"solid\" and he rarely makes mistakes.\nNorris, on the other hand, wears his heart on his sleeve. He seems to be a little more prey to the twisting fortunes of life. He beats himself up about his weaknesses. And he seems more prone to small errors that can have an impact in a title campaign.\nThat was happening last year, and it's still happening this.\nLast year, the question asked above would have been considered fair comment. Norris was definitively faster than Piastri in 2024. He out-qualified him 20 times to four, at an average of 0.147secs. And he won four races to Piastri's two.\nYet Piastri's race-craft was plain for all to see - for example in his superb overtaking move on Norris on the first lap in Monza, or to take the lead and eventually win against Charles Leclerc in Baku.\nBut this season? Piastri has three wins and two poles and Norris one of each. Piastri is 4-2 ahead in qualifying at an average of 0.185secs a lap.\nAnd he's leading the championship despite his unfortunate escapade on the wet grass in Melbourne, which dropped him to ninth at the flag having been challenging Norris for the lead from the start.\nNorris is incredibly fast. But there has never been any doubt that Piastri's highs were at least as good as the Briton's. \nAustralian Piastri came into this season setting himself a target of accessing them much more consistently.\nSo far, he is bang on target. Add that to his robustness, and he is going to make a tough title rival for anyone.\nDo you think Max Verstappen can sustain his amazing run in a car that some have labelled as \"fourth fastest\" or has he been helped by the characteristics of the tracks visited so far? \u2013 Steve\nVery few people in F1 doubt that Verstappen is the all-round best driver on the grid, and that's because his performances have been so strong for so long.\nThe Red Bull driver has been operating at a consistent level of excellence since, basically, the 2018 Canadian Grand Prix, the race he finally ironed out the series of errors that blighted his start to that season. So there is no reason to believe that's about to change.\nHe simply always seems to get the best out of his car, apart from on the odd occasions when he allows tangles with other drivers to get the better of him, such as in Mexico and Hungary last year.\nAs for the Red Bull car, on average qualifying pace, it's second fastest to McLaren by 0.177secs so far, and ahead of the Mercedes and the Ferrari.\nOf course, Verstappen's performances are a factor in that statistic - it's his car that is the fastest Red Bull. But is he definitively faster over one lap than Charles Leclerc and George Russell?\nHe may be, a bit. He may not be. But would he be, for example, consistently 0.135secs a lap faster than Leclerc in qualifying - the gap between Red Bull and Ferrari this year? No one knows for sure. And the answer can only be subjective. But few doubt Leclerc's pace over one lap.\nSo far, the Red Bull has been a fast car, in Verstappen's hands, on certain types of track. It is quick in high-speed corners, and slow. But it lags behind McLaren in long, medium-speed corners, which emphasise its often inconsistent balance.\nThat's why Verstappen was quick in Australia, Japan and Saudi Arabia, but not so in China and Bahrain.\nRed Bull believe they can fix their issues with some upgrades that are due soon, perhaps for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in two races' time.\nBut McLaren are hardly likely to stand still in terms of development.\nVerstappen will get the very best out of the Red Bull, and stay in the title fight as long as he can.\nBut as Fernando Alonso pointed out recently, it's very difficult to sustain a season-long title challenge with a car deficit.\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nChequered Flag Extra: Steiner, Verstappen & Will Cadillac Be Competitive?\nCan Ferrari turn this season around and be in contention for either championship? \u2013 Laura\nAfter five races this season, Ferrari have a sprint victory in China, courtesy of Lewis Hamilton, a single grand prix podium finish, thanks to Charles Leclerc in Saudi Arabia, and lie fourth in the constructors' championship, already 110 points behind leaders McLaren.\nTheir car is the fourth quickest on average on raw performance - 0.312 seconds a lap slower than McLaren in qualifying.\nIt's fair to say this is significantly below their expectations.\nTeam boss Frederic Vasseur predicted over the winter that this season would be as open as last year, that the advantage would swing between the top four teams from race to race. And there is no secret that Ferrari were expecting to start the season in a competitive position and mount a title challenge from the off.\nVasseur believes they can turn their season around. He has repeatedly pointed to last season, and the fact that they were in a less competitive position at the same point in 2024 but transformed their car and came close to winning the constructors' title at the end of the year.\nThey also made an effective job of developing the 2023 car, which was vicious at the start of the season, but much better by the end of it.\nAn upgrade is due soon, although Ferrari have not said at which race.\nThe complication for Ferrari is that they have two sizeable problems.\nThe first is the performance of their car. The second is the performance of Hamilton, which could turn into a major distraction if the seven-time champion cannot improve after three dismal races in Japan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.\nIf neither of those improve soon, the pressure will start to mount.\nLewis Hamilton described his Saudi Arabian Grand Prix as \"horrible\" after finishing seventh, 31 seconds behind team-mate Charles Leclerc\nWhy do the regulations change just when the field is beginning to close up in competitiveness? The new regs for 2026 seem like a lottery for teams who either nail or fail them, leading to a dominant team and those lagging behind. Stable regs = competitive racing. \u2013 Matt\nF1 has always changed its regulations from time to time. It's an inevitable and necessary part of the sport.\nOften in the past, it has been because the governing body felt the need to intervene in some way.\nPerhaps because the cars were getting too fast or dangerous, such as at the end of the last ground-effect era in 1982, or when Ayrton Senna was killed in 1994. Or to change an aspect of racing that was no longer considered desirable, such as when refuelling was banned for 2010. Or to add an aspect that was felt to be lacking, such as when wider, faster cars were introduced in 2017.\nAnd the engine rules have also often changed, again for various reasons.\nThis time, the starting point was the engine rules. F1 and the FIA wanted to make the sport more attractive to new manufacturers. So they set up some working groups involving the manufacturers and came up with the 2026 rules.\nThese retain 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, but simplify them by removing the MGU-H, which recovers energy from the turbo and is highly complex and was considered a barrier to new suppliers.\nThey have also upped the electrical capacity so that about 50% of the total power output will come from the electrical part of the engine, and will run on 100% sustainable fuel.\nIt has worked. Audi came in - which was the idea behind changing the rules. Porsche in the end did not. But Ford has come back, in partnership with Red Bull. Honda is staying when it was going to pull out. And General Motors is entering next year, too, although its engine won't be ready until 2029.\nThere was already a desire to refine the chassis rules, to fix some of the issues that have arisen with the 2022 ground-effect regs. But the new engine rules required further changes.\nIt became clear that recovering sufficient energy to supply the batteries was going to be a problem. So the rule-makers turned to moveable aerodynamics, reducing drag on the straights so the cars were in the braking zones for longer.\nWrangling is still going on about this topic, although the rules are not expected to change significantly - for example by limiting the electrical deployment in races, as some are pushing at the moment - as there is a blocking majority preventing it.\nYes, this might open up the field, but that often happens with new rules. But it will close again. It also provides opportunity for a shake-up of the competitive order, which is often regarded as a positive.\nSeeing as Mercedes dominated the first eight years of the engine regulations when the V6 engines came in, do you see them building that sort of dominance again from the new regulations? - Keegan\nJust because Mercedes nailed the last new engine rules in 2014, does not necessarily mean they will do so again in 2026.\nBasically, Mercedes achieved that because they invested more resources sooner into those rules than their rivals. The other manufacturers have learned from that experience.\nHaving said that, the word in F1 is that Mercedes are currently best placed for the new rules. \nMany believe that what's motivating the current debate about the engine rules - whether it be changing them again earlier than originally planned, or tinkering with the 2026 rules - is founded in the concerns of Mercedes' rivals - especially Red Bull - that they may face a competitive deficit next year.\nOne interesting angle to emerge in recent weeks is that senior sources say that the FIA's single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis is telling teams and manufacturers that the governing body doesn't want engines to be a performance differentiator in the future.\nBut that raises a major philosophical question. Why not? Engines have always been a performance differentiator. It's called motorsport, after all. Cars don't move without engines.\nAnd who decided this? Was this agreed with the other stakeholders first?\nIt appears not.\nThis will likely run for a while.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nSenna's Lotus 'the most beautiful F1 livery'\nWhat is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, has won Canada's election to become the country's next prime minister.\nHe was sworn into the position last month after his predecessor resigned, but called for a snap election that saw Canadians head to the polls on Monday.\nCarney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.\nUnlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney had never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March, and has now been elected by the people.\nHe had touted his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns. \nCarney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency. \nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April, though he has in the past advocated for similar policies. \n\"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn the campaign trail, he has also advocated for making Canada a \"clean and conventional\" energy superpower, and to speed up major project approvals. \nCarney has called himself a \"pragmatist\" when questioned about potential conflicts between his energy policies and his climate values.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.

Getty ImagesJerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve (left) and Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, walk the grounds during the Jackson Hole economic symposium in 2019Crossing paths with TrumpCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March, and has now been elected by the people.He had touted his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.A turnaround victory made possible by TrumpWho's who in Canada's federal electionA stunning reversal of fortunes in Canada's historic electionA simple guide to Canada's federal electionEarly life and childhoodAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",

Should never have been allowed in the first place. Now every sport must follow suit.\"\nCampaign group Women's Rights Network said: \"We are pleased that the FA has finally seen the light. But it shouldn't have been such a hard fight to get here.\"\nAsked what Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer thought of transgender women being banned from women's sport, his spokesman said the government had \"been clear that biology matters when it comes to women's sport and that everyone should be compliant with the law\".\nHe said the government would \"continue to work to make sure that women and girls across the country can enjoy sports and we will continue to support bodies to protect the  integrity, safety and fairness of the game\".\nHe said it was the responsibility of sporting bodies to set their own rules.\nNatalie Washington, campaign lead for Football vs Transphobia, said transgender women are now likely to give up football.\n\"The people I know that are talking about this are saying, 'Well, that's it for football for me',\" she said.\n\"Most people clearly don't feel that they can go and play in the men's game for reasons of safety, for reasons of comfort.\"\nPride Sports, which runs the Football vs Transphobia campaign, said there is no \"football-specific peer-reviewed research or evidence that shows the existing policies constitute a safety risk\".\nLord David Triesman, former chairman of the FA, said there should be \"consequences for the most senior FA officers\" who took the decision to previously allow transgender women in women's football.\n\"The FA has finally seen sense. It would have been the utmost foolishness to disregard the Supreme Court,\" he said.\nAnti-discrimination group Kick it Out said: \"Now is the time to show solidarity with the trans community and remind ourselves that football brings people together and is often a space for belonging, connection, and joy.\n\"The recent Supreme Court ruling and the FA's decision to change its policy will have far-reaching consequences, not only for the people we support but for our friends, families, team-mates and wider communities.\n\"Transphobic abuse - on the pitch, in the stands and online - is real and rising.\"\nThe FA is the first major governing sporting body to amend its transgender eligibility criteria following the Supreme Court ruling.\nThe Ultimate Pool Group (UPG) - the professional body for eight-ball pool - banned transgender women from its female category last month.\nOther governing bodies, including the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), are reassessing their transgender eligibility criteria.\nAthletics, cycling and aquatics have implemented outright bans on transgender women taking part in women's events.\nIn 2022 British Triathlon became the first British sporting body to establish an open category in which transgender athletes can compete.\nThis year the ECB banned transgender women from elite domestic cricket.\nThe ruling meant any player that had gone through male puberty would not be able to feature in the top two tiers of the women's game, but that transgender women were still eligible for the third tier and below.\nHowever, the ECB is expected to follow the FA ruling by banning transgender women from all levels of the women's game.\nEngland Netball's new guidelines, which will apply from 1 September, recognise three distinct gender participation categories: female, male and mixed.\nThe female category would be \"exclusively for players born female, irrespective of their gender identity\", while mixed netball will \"serve as the sport's inclusive category, allowing players to complete under the gender with which they identify\". \nBBC sports editor Dan Roan\nThe FA is now talking to the 28 transgender women who are registered in England which this change in policy will affect in a bid to look at ways in which they can stay involved in the sport.\nIn recent years, governing bodies of other sports, like rugby and hockey, had introduced tougher gender policies, adding to the pressure on football to follow suit.\nSenior officials insist they have not taken an ideological position on what they see as a complicated issue, and that their task has always been to provide as many opportunities to play to as many people as possible.\nBut the fact they have had to perform a U-turn on a transgender eligibility policy they updated only three weeks ago will come under scrutiny.\nThe FA rejects suggestions that it caved in to pressure, claiming it had no choice to amend its approach yet again because its lawyers concluded that the subsequent Supreme Court ruling last month left it vulnerable to potential legal claims from some biologically female players.\nBut the fact they have done so will be welcomed by those who felt their previous stance was an unsatisfactory attempt at compromise between competing rights and freedoms - one that the critics felt lacked a clear direction, creating unclear and impractical guidelines and potentially compromising female players' fairness and safety as a result.\nSupporters of the trans community will be dismayed by what they see as an unnecessary, exclusionary and discriminatory policy that risks further marginalising a small number of people from the sport they love.\nWhat does the 'definition of a woman' ruling mean for sport?\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Miami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Dates: 2-4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary of practice and qualifying online and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra; race on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nFormula 1 heads to the United States this weekend for the Miami Grand Prix, the sixth round of the 2025 world championship.\nLast time out in Saudi Arabia, McLaren's Oscar Piastri won his third race of the season to take the lead in the drivers' standings. \nA year ago, Miami was the scene of Lando Norris' first F1 victory.\nBefore this year's race, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.\nWould it be fair to say Lando Norris is faster than Oscar Piastri, but Piastri is a better racing driver? \u2013 Rob\nThe comparison between McLaren team-mates Norris and Piastri - as drivers, and as personalities - is one of many interesting aspects of this season.\nThat's because they are such contrasting people. Piastri is the epitome of robustness. Nothing seems to faze him. Even the weekends when he is a little off Norris' pace he seems to take in his stride. As Max Verstappen pointed out in Jeddah, he is very \"solid\" and he rarely makes mistakes.\nNorris, on the other hand, wears his heart on his sleeve. He seems to be a little more prey to the twisting fortunes of life. He beats himself up about his weaknesses. And he seems more prone to small errors that can have an impact in a title campaign.\nThat was happening last year, and it's still happening this.\nLast year, the question asked above would have been considered fair comment. Norris was definitively faster than Piastri in 2024. He out-qualified him 20 times to four, at an average of 0.147secs. And he won four races to Piastri's two.\nYet Piastri's race-craft was plain for all to see - for example in his superb overtaking move on Norris on the first lap in Monza, or to take the lead and eventually win against Charles Leclerc in Baku.\nBut this season? Piastri has three wins and two poles and Norris one of each. Piastri is 4-2 ahead in qualifying at an average of 0.185secs a lap.\nAnd he's leading the championship despite his unfortunate escapade on the wet grass in Melbourne, which dropped him to ninth at the flag having been challenging Norris for the lead from the start.\nNorris is incredibly fast. But there has never been any doubt that Piastri's highs were at least as good as the Briton's. \nAustralian Piastri came into this season setting himself a target of accessing them much more consistently.\nSo far, he is bang on target. Add that to his robustness, and he is going to make a tough title rival for anyone.\nDo you think Max Verstappen can sustain his amazing run in a car that some have labelled as \"fourth fastest\" or has he been helped by the characteristics of the tracks visited so far? \u2013 Steve\nVery few people in F1 doubt that Verstappen is the all-round best driver on the grid, and that's because his performances have been so strong for so long.\nThe Red Bull driver has been operating at a consistent level of excellence since, basically, the 2018 Canadian Grand Prix, the race he finally ironed out the series of errors that blighted his start to that season. So there is no reason to believe that's about to change.\nHe simply always seems to get the best out of his car, apart from on the odd occasions when he allows tangles with other drivers to get the better of him, such as in Mexico and Hungary last year.\nAs for the Red Bull car, on average qualifying pace, it's second fastest to McLaren by 0.177secs so far, and ahead of the Mercedes and the Ferrari.\nOf course, Verstappen's performances are a factor in that statistic - it's his car that is the fastest Red Bull. But is he definitively faster over one lap than Charles Leclerc and George Russell?\nHe may be, a bit. He may not be. But would he be, for example, consistently 0.135secs a lap faster than Leclerc in qualifying - the gap between Red Bull and Ferrari this year? No one knows for sure. And the answer can only be subjective. But few doubt Leclerc's pace over one lap.\nSo far, the Red Bull has been a fast car, in Verstappen's hands, on certain types of track. It is quick in high-speed corners, and slow. But it lags behind McLaren in long, medium-speed corners, which emphasise its often inconsistent balance.\nThat's why Verstappen was quick in Australia, Japan and Saudi Arabia, but not so in China and Bahrain.\nRed Bull believe they can fix their issues with some upgrades that are due soon, perhaps for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in two races' time.\nBut McLaren are hardly likely to stand still in terms of development.\nVerstappen will get the very best out of the Red Bull, and stay in the title fight as long as he can.\nBut as Fernando Alonso pointed out recently, it's very difficult to sustain a season-long title challenge with a car deficit.\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nChequered Flag Extra: Steiner, Verstappen & Will Cadillac Be Competitive?\nCan Ferrari turn this season around and be in contention for either championship? \u2013 Laura\nAfter five races this season, Ferrari have a sprint victory in China, courtesy of Lewis Hamilton, a single grand prix podium finish, thanks to Charles Leclerc in Saudi Arabia, and lie fourth in the constructors' championship, already 110 points behind leaders McLaren.\nTheir car is the fourth quickest on average on raw performance - 0.312 seconds a lap slower than McLaren in qualifying.\nIt's fair to say this is significantly below their expectations.\nTeam boss Frederic Vasseur predicted over the winter that this season would be as open as last year, that the advantage would swing between the top four teams from race to race. And there is no secret that Ferrari were expecting to start the season in a competitive position and mount a title challenge from the off.\nVasseur believes they can turn their season around. He has repeatedly pointed to last season, and the fact that they were in a less competitive position at the same point in 2024 but transformed their car and came close to winning the constructors' title at the end of the year.\nThey also made an effective job of developing the 2023 car, which was vicious at the start of the season, but much better by the end of it.\nAn upgrade is due soon, although Ferrari have not said at which race.\nThe complication for Ferrari is that they have two sizeable problems.\nThe first is the performance of their car. The second is the performance of Hamilton, which could turn into a major distraction if the seven-time champion cannot improve after three dismal races in Japan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.\nIf neither of those improve soon, the pressure will start to mount.\nLewis Hamilton described his Saudi Arabian Grand Prix as \"horrible\" after finishing seventh, 31 seconds behind team-mate Charles Leclerc\nWhy do the regulations change just when the field is beginning to close up in competitiveness? The new regs for 2026 seem like a lottery for teams who either nail or fail them, leading to a dominant team and those lagging behind. Stable regs = competitive racing. \u2013 Matt\nF1 has always changed its regulations from time to time. It's an inevitable and necessary part of the sport.\nOften in the past, it has been because the governing body felt the need to intervene in some way.\nPerhaps because the cars were getting too fast or dangerous, such as at the end of the last ground-effect era in 1982, or when Ayrton Senna was killed in 1994. Or to change an aspect of racing that was no longer considered desirable, such as when refuelling was banned for 2010. Or to add an aspect that was felt to be lacking, such as when wider, faster cars were introduced in 2017.\nAnd the engine rules have also often changed, again for various reasons.\nThis time, the starting point was the engine rules. F1 and the FIA wanted to make the sport more attractive to new manufacturers. So they set up some working groups involving the manufacturers and came up with the 2026 rules.\nThese retain 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, but simplify them by removing the MGU-H, which recovers energy from the turbo and is highly complex and was considered a barrier to new suppliers.\nThey have also upped the electrical capacity so that about 50% of the total power output will come from the electrical part of the engine, and will run on 100% sustainable fuel.\nIt has worked. Audi came in - which was the idea behind changing the rules. Porsche in the end did not. But Ford has come back, in partnership with Red Bull. Honda is staying when it was going to pull out. And General Motors is entering next year, too, although its engine won't be ready until 2029.\nThere was already a desire to refine the chassis rules, to fix some of the issues that have arisen with the 2022 ground-effect regs. But the new engine rules required further changes.\nIt became clear that recovering sufficient energy to supply the batteries was going to be a problem. So the rule-makers turned to moveable aerodynamics, reducing drag on the straights so the cars were in the braking zones for longer.\nWrangling is still going on about this topic, although the rules are not expected to change significantly - for example by limiting the electrical deployment in races, as some are pushing at the moment - as there is a blocking majority preventing it.\nYes, this might open up the field, but that often happens with new rules. But it will close again. It also provides opportunity for a shake-up of the competitive order, which is often regarded as a positive.\nSeeing as Mercedes dominated the first eight years of the engine regulations when the V6 engines came in, do you see them building that sort of dominance again from the new regulations? - Keegan\nJust because Mercedes nailed the last new engine rules in 2014, does not necessarily mean they will do so again in 2026.\nBasically, Mercedes achieved that because they invested more resources sooner into those rules than their rivals. The other manufacturers have learned from that experience.\nHaving said that, the word in F1 is that Mercedes are currently best placed for the new rules. \nMany believe that what's motivating the current debate about the engine rules - whether it be changing them again earlier than originally planned, or tinkering with the 2026 rules - is founded in the concerns of Mercedes' rivals - especially Red Bull - that they may face a competitive deficit next year.\nOne interesting angle to emerge in recent weeks is that senior sources say that the FIA's single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis is telling teams and manufacturers that the governing body doesn't want engines to be a performance differentiator in the future.\nBut that raises a major philosophical question. Why not? Engines have always been a performance differentiator. It's called motorsport, after all. Cars don't move without engines.\nAnd who decided this? Was this agreed with the other stakeholders first?\nIt appears not.\nThis will likely run for a while.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nSenna's Lotus 'the most beautiful F1 livery'\nWhat is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?",

We want to be unbeaten for the whole season.\"\nThe numbers behind Chelsea's latest WSL title\nOnly in three previous completed seasons has the WSL been won by an unbeaten side - Arsenal in 2012, Manchester City in 2016 and Chelsea themselves in 2018.\nBut it has never been done over the current format of a 22-game season. If Chelsea avoid defeat against Tottenham next Sunday then at home to Liverpool on 10 May, they will have broken new ground.\nBompastor will have to deal with the repercussions of such a disappointing Champions League exit - but registering perhaps the most comprehensive WSL title of all time will go some way to making up for it.\nIndeed, if Chelsea win their final two games, they will set a new WSL points record - beating their own tally of 58 in 2022-23. Victory in their remaining fixtures will make the Blues the first side to record 60 points in a campaign.\nSonia Bompastor has added the WSL title to the three French leagues she won with Lyon\n\"I always look for perfection and the ideal,\" Bompastor told her post-match media conference at Leigh Sports Village.\n\"I told my players out of position and defensively I want to keep a clean sheet. I want to fight for each other. We spoke about how we managed the depth and how we needed to be compact, win the duels and win the second balls. It is all these details. \n\"I am never satisfied. Even when we win I am already focused on the treble and the other finals.\"\nBompastor has become the first manager to lead a side to the WSL title in their maiden season since Laura Harvey took Arsenal to the top of the inaugural league in 2011.\nShe admitted she had worried about the pressure when she made her much-vaunted move from Lyon to London, and filling the shoes of predecessor Emma Hayes, who she praised fulsomely after beating Man Utd.\nThis video can not be played\nBompastor - proud of WSL title winners Chelsea\n\"When you come to Chelsea everyone expects you to win the league,\" she said. \"It was the same in Lyon but here the competition is higher. To be able to achieve it for six years in a row for Chelsea and in my first season, it is not easy. \n\"I heard some noise about the fact it is too easy for Chelsea but it is not! When you are able to be unbeaten, to beat Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United twice, I don't know how people can think that. It is unbelievable.\n\"Don't think it's easy. It's never easy. It's a great achievement and a lot of work every day. I don't let my players breathe.\n\"I want to thank Emma [Hayes]. I am sure she is really happy tonight with our title. She left the club in a great place to build on the legacy.\"\nChelsea have not always blown sides away this campaign - they have scored fewer goals than second-placed Arsenal, while no player has netted double figures in the league.\nWednesday night encapsulated their league campaign. United had more shots, a higher xG, and a very solid shout for a penalty before half-time when Millie Bright appeared to trip Grace Clinton. Chelsea keeper Hannah Hampton made five saves and was named player of the match.\nBut they find a way to win, and win, and win. And crucially, not lose.\n\"Coming to this club I always wanted to achieve trophies,\" Hampton told the BBC. \"The fact that I can say that in the two seasons I have been here we have won the title both times it is surreal. It never gets old. As many times as we win it, it'll never get old.\"\nChelsea's season now has three games to run - the two league fixtures, then the FA Cup final against Manchester United, again, on 18 May.\nTo end it unbeaten domestically would be a remarkable achievement.\n\"It's what dreams are made of for Sonia Bompastor,\" former England defender Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports. \"Her staff, the new players and the existing players that have done this before. They know what it feels like. They don't care where they do it or how they do it as long as they do it.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond. \nAhead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures. \n\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.\n\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"\nGeneral Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance. \nIn an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results. \nTariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.\nThe duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May. \nUnder the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US. \nThat share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.\nThe White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year. \nThe adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.\nIn remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a \"very, very small part of the car\" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US.\n\"We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,\" he said.  \nLast week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts. \nA letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".\nFord said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".\n\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.\nThe car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".\n\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".\nStellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs. \n\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added.",

We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting\", the museum spokesperson told the BBC. \n\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.\nSophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".\nThis is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.\n\"In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,\" Ms McAloone said.\nThe Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot \u2013 a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum \u2013 as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of \"public favourites\" from the gallery's collection.\nJonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"\n\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said. \nRestoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.\nHe said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.\nConservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.\n\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.\nRothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.\nUmaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.\nDuring his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.\nRachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".\nThis includes \"accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions\", she said.\nShe said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum. \nThe loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.\nThe museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.\nThe Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.\nIn 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.\nSharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: \"It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.\"\nThe Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.\nRothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 painting is one of several works of modern art that have been damaged in the Netherlands in recent years.\nIn November 2024, multiple screen prints by the US pop artist Andy Warhol were damaged by thieves during an attempted robbery of the MPV art gallery in the town of Oisterwijk.\nIn another incident, a Dutch town hall admitted it \"most likely\" disposed of 46 artworks by accident \u2013 including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen \u2013 during renovation works last year.\nMuseums have different policies when responding to damage caused by children.\nIn August last year, a four-year-old boy accidentally smashed a 3,500-year-old jar into pieces at the Hecht Museum in Israel.\nAt the time, Hecht Museum worker Lihi Laszlo told the BBC the museum would not treat the incident \"with severity\" because \"the jar was accidentally damaged by a young child\".\nThe family were invited back to the exhibition with his family for an organised tour shortly after the incident occurred.",

        "article_text": "Miami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Dates: 2-4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary of practice and qualifying online and BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra; race on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nFormula 1 heads to the United States this weekend for the Miami Grand Prix, the sixth round of the 2025 world championship.\nLast time out in Saudi Arabia, McLaren's Oscar Piastri won his third race of the season to take the lead in the drivers' standings. \nA year ago, Miami was the scene of Lando Norris' first F1 victory.\nBefore this year's race, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.\nWould it be fair to say Lando Norris is faster than Oscar Piastri, but Piastri is a better racing driver? \u2013 Rob\nThe comparison between McLaren team-mates Norris and Piastri - as drivers, and as personalities - is one of many interesting aspects of this season.\nThat's because they are such contrasting people. Piastri is the epitome of robustness. Nothing seems to faze him. Even the weekends when he is a little off Norris' pace he seems to take in his stride. As Max Verstappen pointed out in Jeddah, he is very \"solid\" and he rarely makes mistakes.\nNorris, on the other hand, wears his heart on his sleeve. He seems to be a little more prey to the twisting fortunes of life. He beats himself up about his weaknesses. And he seems more prone to small errors that can have an impact in a title campaign.\nThat was happening last year, and it's still happening this.\nLast year, the question asked above would have been considered fair comment. Norris was definitively faster than Piastri in 2024. He out-qualified him 20 times to four, at an average of 0.147secs. And he won four races to Piastri's two.\nYet Piastri's race-craft was plain for all to see - for example in his superb overtaking move on Norris on the first lap in Monza, or to take the lead and eventually win against Charles Leclerc in Baku.\nBut this season? Piastri has three wins and two poles and Norris one of each. Piastri is 4-2 ahead in qualifying at an average of 0.185secs a lap.\nAnd he's leading the championship despite his unfortunate escapade on the wet grass in Melbourne, which dropped him to ninth at the flag having been challenging Norris for the lead from the start.\nNorris is incredibly fast. But there has never been any doubt that Piastri's highs were at least as good as the Briton's. \nAustralian Piastri came into this season setting himself a target of accessing them much more consistently.\nSo far, he is bang on target. Add that to his robustness, and he is going to make a tough title rival for anyone.\nDo you think Max Verstappen can sustain his amazing run in a car that some have labelled as \"fourth fastest\" or has he been helped by the characteristics of the tracks visited so far? \u2013 Steve\nVery few people in F1 doubt that Verstappen is the all-round best driver on the grid, and that's because his performances have been so strong for so long.\nThe Red Bull driver has been operating at a consistent level of excellence since, basically, the 2018 Canadian Grand Prix, the race he finally ironed out the series of errors that blighted his start to that season. So there is no reason to believe that's about to change.\nHe simply always seems to get the best out of his car, apart from on the odd occasions when he allows tangles with other drivers to get the better of him, such as in Mexico and Hungary last year.\nAs for the Red Bull car, on average qualifying pace, it's second fastest to McLaren by 0.177secs so far, and ahead of the Mercedes and the Ferrari.\nOf course, Verstappen's performances are a factor in that statistic - it's his car that is the fastest Red Bull. But is he definitively faster over one lap than Charles Leclerc and George Russell?\nHe may be, a bit. He may not be. But would he be, for example, consistently 0.135secs a lap faster than Leclerc in qualifying - the gap between Red Bull and Ferrari this year? No one knows for sure. And the answer can only be subjective. But few doubt Leclerc's pace over one lap.\nSo far, the Red Bull has been a fast car, in Verstappen's hands, on certain types of track. It is quick in high-speed corners, and slow. But it lags behind McLaren in long, medium-speed corners, which emphasise its often inconsistent balance.\nThat's why Verstappen was quick in Australia, Japan and Saudi Arabia, but not so in China and Bahrain.\nRed Bull believe they can fix their issues with some upgrades that are due soon, perhaps for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in two races' time.\nBut McLaren are hardly likely to stand still in terms of development.\nVerstappen will get the very best out of the Red Bull, and stay in the title fight as long as he can.\nBut as Fernando Alonso pointed out recently, it's very difficult to sustain a season-long title challenge with a car deficit.\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nChequered Flag Extra: Steiner, Verstappen & Will Cadillac Be Competitive?\nCan Ferrari turn this season around and be in contention for either championship? \u2013 Laura\nAfter five races this season, Ferrari have a sprint victory in China, courtesy of Lewis Hamilton, a single grand prix podium finish, thanks to Charles Leclerc in Saudi Arabia, and lie fourth in the constructors' championship, already 110 points behind leaders McLaren.\nTheir car is the fourth quickest on average on raw performance - 0.312 seconds a lap slower than McLaren in qualifying.\nIt's fair to say this is significantly below their expectations.\nTeam boss Frederic Vasseur predicted over the winter that this season would be as open as last year, that the advantage would swing between the top four teams from race to race. And there is no secret that Ferrari were expecting to start the season in a competitive position and mount a title challenge from the off.\nVasseur believes they can turn their season around. He has repeatedly pointed to last season, and the fact that they were in a less competitive position at the same point in 2024 but transformed their car and came close to winning the constructors' title at the end of the year.\nThey also made an effective job of developing the 2023 car, which was vicious at the start of the season, but much better by the end of it.\nAn upgrade is due soon, although Ferrari have not said at which race.\nThe complication for Ferrari is that they have two sizeable problems.\nThe first is the performance of their car. The second is the performance of Hamilton, which could turn into a major distraction if the seven-time champion cannot improve after three dismal races in Japan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.\nIf neither of those improve soon, the pressure will start to mount.\nLewis Hamilton described his Saudi Arabian Grand Prix as \"horrible\" after finishing seventh, 31 seconds behind team-mate Charles Leclerc\nWhy do the regulations change just when the field is beginning to close up in competitiveness? The new regs for 2026 seem like a lottery for teams who either nail or fail them, leading to a dominant team and those lagging behind. Stable regs = competitive racing. \u2013 Matt\nF1 has always changed its regulations from time to time. It's an inevitable and necessary part of the sport.\nOften in the past, it has been because the governing body felt the need to intervene in some way.\nPerhaps because the cars were getting too fast or dangerous, such as at the end of the last ground-effect era in 1982, or when Ayrton Senna was killed in 1994. Or to change an aspect of racing that was no longer considered desirable, such as when refuelling was banned for 2010. Or to add an aspect that was felt to be lacking, such as when wider, faster cars were introduced in 2017.\nAnd the engine rules have also often changed, again for various reasons.\nThis time, the starting point was the engine rules. F1 and the FIA wanted to make the sport more attractive to new manufacturers. So they set up some working groups involving the manufacturers and came up with the 2026 rules.\nThese retain 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, but simplify them by removing the MGU-H, which recovers energy from the turbo and is highly complex and was considered a barrier to new suppliers.\nThey have also upped the electrical capacity so that about 50% of the total power output will come from the electrical part of the engine, and will run on 100% sustainable fuel.\nIt has worked. Audi came in - which was the idea behind changing the rules. Porsche in the end did not. But Ford has come back, in partnership with Red Bull. Honda is staying when it was going to pull out. And General Motors is entering next year, too, although its engine won't be ready until 2029.\nThere was already a desire to refine the chassis rules, to fix some of the issues that have arisen with the 2022 ground-effect regs. But the new engine rules required further changes.\nIt became clear that recovering sufficient energy to supply the batteries was going to be a problem. So the rule-makers turned to moveable aerodynamics, reducing drag on the straights so the cars were in the braking zones for longer.\nWrangling is still going on about this topic, although the rules are not expected to change significantly - for example by limiting the electrical deployment in races, as some are pushing at the moment - as there is a blocking majority preventing it.\nYes, this might open up the field, but that often happens with new rules. But it will close again. It also provides opportunity for a shake-up of the competitive order, which is often regarded as a positive.\nSeeing as Mercedes dominated the first eight years of the engine regulations when the V6 engines came in, do you see them building that sort of dominance again from the new regulations? - Keegan\nJust because Mercedes nailed the last new engine rules in 2014, does not necessarily mean they will do so again in 2026.\nBasically, Mercedes achieved that because they invested more resources sooner into those rules than their rivals. The other manufacturers have learned from that experience.\nHaving said that, the word in F1 is that Mercedes are currently best placed for the new rules. \nMany believe that what's motivating the current debate about the engine rules - whether it be changing them again earlier than originally planned, or tinkering with the 2026 rules - is founded in the concerns of Mercedes' rivals - especially Red Bull - that they may face a competitive deficit next year.\nOne interesting angle to emerge in recent weeks is that senior sources say that the FIA's single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis is telling teams and manufacturers that the governing body doesn't want engines to be a performance differentiator in the future.\nBut that raises a major philosophical question. Why not? Engines have always been a performance differentiator. It's called motorsport, after all. Cars don't move without engines.\nAnd who decided this? Was this agreed with the other stakeholders first?\nIt appears not.\nThis will likely run for a while.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nSenna's Lotus 'the most beautiful F1 livery'\nWhat is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?",

A year ago, Miami was the scene of Lando Norris' first F1 victory.Before this year's race, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.Would it be fair to say Lando Norris is faster than Oscar Piastri, but Piastri is a better racing driver? But it lags behind McLaren in long, medium-speed corners, which emphasise its often inconsistent balance.That's why Verstappen was quick in Australia, Japan and Saudi Arabia, but not so in China and Bahrain.Red Bull believe they can fix their issues with some upgrades that are due soon, perhaps for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in two races' time.But McLaren are hardly likely to stand still in terms of development.Verstappen will get the very best out of the Red Bull, and stay in the title fight as long as he can.But as Fernando Alonso pointed out recently, it's very difficult to sustain a season-long title challenge with a car deficit.How to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBCPublished1 day agoChequered Flag Extra: Steiner, Verstappen & Will Cadillac Be Competitive?Can Ferrari turn this season around and be in contention for either championship? And he won four races to Piastri's two.Yet Piastri's race-craft was plain for all to see - for example in his superb overtaking move on Norris on the first lap in Monza, or to take the lead and eventually win against Charles Leclerc in Baku.But this season? So there is no reason to believe that's about to change.He simply always seems to get the best out of his car, apart from on the odd occasions when he allows tangles with other drivers to get the better of him, such as in Mexico and Hungary last year.As for the Red Bull car, on average qualifying pace, it's second fastest to McLaren by 0.177secs so far, and ahead of the Mercedes and the Ferrari.Of course, Verstappen's performances are a factor in that statistic - it's his car that is the fastest Red Bull.",

        "article_text": "In Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.\nPeople here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.\nIn recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.\n\"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic \u2026 Trump's the best thing America ever had.''\nOther spectators are more nuanced.\n\"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\"\nAustralia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency \u2013 and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.\nBut Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world. \nTrump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' \u2013 a value that embodies friendship and loyalty \u2013 and that extends to politics too.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.\nAll of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?\nIn the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.\n\"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\"\nThe US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China \u2013 and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.\nThe rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.\nIt's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.\nBack in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.\n\"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that \u2026 we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\"\nAustralia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.\nA blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.\n\"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\"\nWhile only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.\n\"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\"\nAnd, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.\n\"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\"\nA poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.\nAnd a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.\nBig questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.\nDutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.\n\"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\"\nDutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker \u2026 a big thinker.\"\nAnd he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.\nAlbanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.\nThat may turn out to be in his favour.\nIndeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.\nFor Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.\n\"What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,\" he says. \n\"The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \"\nBut whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.\n\"We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,\" says Andrews. \"I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism \u2013 so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.\"\nBack at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos \u2013 the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground. \nFlying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his post as national security adviser, and will nominate him as ambassador to the United Nations.\nIn a post on social media, Trump thanked Waltz for his work and said he would be temporarily replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who will continue as America's top diplomat. \nWaltz had faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed - a political embarrassment likely to feature during confirmation hearings for the UN post. \nThe former Florida congressman is the first senior member of the administration to leave the White House in Trump's second term.\n\"From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \n\"I know he will do the same in his new role.\"\nWaltz posted a short statement on X, alongside a screenshot of the announcement by the president.\n\"I'm deeply honoured to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,\" he wrote.\nAccording to the BBC's US partner CBS News, Trump decided to nominate Waltz as UN ambassador just hours before the announcement on Thursday.\nMultiple sources told the network he was ousted because of the Signal situation and a perception in the White House that he did not properly vet National Security Council staff, among other reasons.\nBut the sources said Trump respects Waltz so he was given a soft landing and a high-profile new post.\nHowever, the BBC spoke to several US officials - who wished to remain anonymous - and they suggested the Trump administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate, allowing the president to get rid of him completely without having to fire him. \nWaltz has been under scrutiny since he acknowledged in March mistakenly adding the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a group chat on Signal with top US security officials.\nConfidential plans for a military strike on Yemen's Houthis were discussed on the message chain, whose members included Waltz, Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. \nThere was uncertainty on Thursday over the fate of Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, a seasoned foreign policy hand from Trump's first term who was also on the Signal chat. \nWong was asked about the leak during an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme on Wednesday. He said the administration had been \"very successful\" in taking on Yemen's Houthis and \"the president led on that\".\nIn March, lawmakers questioned some of the other Signal chat participants at hearings, including the director of national intelligence and the director of the CIA.\nThe UN ambassador position remains unfilled. Trump withdrew the nomination of his first pick, New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, amid Republican concerns about preserving their slender majority in the House of Representatives. \nMinnesota Governor and former Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz made light of the national security adviser's exit on Thursday.\nHe posted on X: \"Mike Waltz has left the chat.\"\nWaltz has continued to use Signal, according to an image captured by a Reuters photographer at a White House cabinet meeting on Wednesday.\nThe zoomed-in picture showed Waltz checking his phone and a chat ongoing with a contact saved under the name of JD Vance, who is US vice-president.\nThe message from the Vance contact read in part: \"I have confirmation from my counterpart it's turned off. He is going to be here.\"\nIn an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday evening, Vance rejected any suggestion that Waltz had been fired, saying he was actually being promoted.\n\"I like Mike,\" said Vance. \"I think he's a great guy.

John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.\n\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"\nThousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.  \nThough not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food. \nOnce native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction. \n\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.\nIt was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx. \nThe lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring. \n\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.\nTo combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind. \nBut last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.\nSo Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.\n\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo. \nOver the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.\n\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.\nWe're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.\nThere are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.\n\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.\nThe key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.\n\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure. \n\"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\"\nThe final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring. \n",

The state matches are a four-day format and we will need you to take more singles.' He replied: 'Sir, if I can hit a ball for six, why would I take a single off it?' That's when I realised he was ready for the next level.\"\nThat six-hitting lit up the most glamourous of cricketing stages on Monday when the teenager became the youngest player to score a century in men's T20 cricket.\nBatting for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans, he took down some of the world's best bowlers in a scintillating 38-ball innings that included 11 sixes and seven fours.\nExperienced international bowlers Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar and Rashid Khan were treated with the same disdain as those unlucky 12-year-olds who netted with Suryavanshi a couple of years earlier.\n14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi stuns the IPL\n'Remember the name' - cricket world reacts to Suryavanshi century\nVaibhav's entry to the IPL has been dramatic. He started his career with a six off the first ball he faced and went on to score a hundred in just his third appearance.\nBorn in Samastipur, a small district in India's Bihar, he quickly showed promise. Vaibhav's father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, himself a club-level cricketer, saw a spark in his son. But there were no proper academies around the district, so he started his training at home from the age of five.\nSanjeev, who used to run a small shop, began to realise his son needed a proper coach. So when Vaibhav turned eight, his father decided to take him to Patna city, a three-hour journey away.\n\"Many people would tell him: 'What are you doing?' But he was the first person to believe in Vaibhav's abilities,\" said Robin Singh, a coach from Bihar.\n\"To ensure his son trained well and got to use the best facilities, his father had to sell a plot of land. His mother had to make a lot of sacrifices too. She would wake up at three in the morning to prepare breakfast for him and would even send food for the coaches.\"\nVaibhav impressed his new coaches in no time.\n\"When I started working with him, I found him quite different from others. You would give him a demo of a technique or a shot, and he would pick it up in no time,\" Ojha said.\n\"Most of the players adopt things easily in practice, but when it comes to playing matches, they fail. But the unique feature about Vaibhav was that he would execute things perfectly even during high-pressure matches.\"\nVaibhav was always ahead of his age group. From his strokeplay to game awareness, he would stand out.\n\"Within 10 days of playing alongside the kids of his age, we realised we were wasting his time. So, we started making him practise with senior players,\" Singh recalled.\nVaibhav would practise daily from 7.30am to 4pm, facing 450 balls each day. By the time he was 12, his coaches were confident enough to let him pursue cricket professionally.\nHe played for the Bihar under-19s team and amassed consistent runs, prompting selectors to name him in the India Under-19s team. Aged just 13, he smashed a 58-ball hundred in a youth Test against Australia.\nHe was soon drafted into Bihar's squad for the Ranji Trophy (India's premier first-class tournament) before becoming the youngest player to get a contract at the IPL auction as Rajasthan signed him for \u00a3103,789 (1.1 crore rupees) in December 2024.\n\"Vaibhav's role model is Brian Lara, so his game is aggressive, and he plays the ball on merit without any fear at all,\" Ojha added.\n\"We expected him to get an IPL contract, and our joy doubled the moment Rajasthan Royals got him because they have [India legend] Rahul Dravid on their coaching staff.\"\nSingh added: \"When he became the youngest to debut in first-class cricket, I told him: 'Anyone can become the youngest. I'll be happy when you become the youngest centurion.' So yesterday he called me up after scoring the century and said: 'Sir, youngest centurion.' And I couldn't be prouder.\"\nAlmost half of the runs Suryavanshi has scored in the IPL (46%) have come through the mid-wicket and long-on region. He is particularly savage against pace bowling, scoring more than 100 runs at a strike-rate of 243 in this season's IPL against the quicker men\nSuryavanshi has already been nicknamed Boss Baby in cricketing circles by those who see comparisons with Chris Gayle, aka The Universe Boss.\nWest Indian Gayle still holds the record for the fastest IPL century, having taken just 30 balls in 2013, while Suryavanshi easily beat the record of 18 years and 118 days for the youngest player to score a T20 century which was previously held by Maharashtra's Vijay Zol.\nSachin Tendulkar - the greatest run-scorer of all time - made his India debut aged just 16, and Suryavanshi's former coach believe he will soon follow The Little Master into the national team.\n\"A guy from a small village in Bihar has made it to the IPL. The whole world is talking about him. So, he knows how to open doors. Don't be surprised if he makes it to international level soon,\" Singh said.\nBefore then, Suryavanshi, who has been gifted almost \u00a39,000 by his state government following his IPL century, has his sights set on title-chasing Mumbai Indians on Thursday, where he comes face-to-face with Jasprit Bumrah, the world's best bowler.\nListen to live commentary on Rajasthan Royals v Mumbai Indians on Thursday, live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app\nSuryavanshi's century has made the front pages of the newspapers in India \n1 of 3\nIPL auction: Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Rishabh Pant make history\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has acknowledged he does have the ability to bring back a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, but that he will not do so.\nKilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was removed from the US in March. Judges all the way up to the US Supreme Court have ruled that this was done in error, and that Trump's team should help \"facilitate\" his return.\nTrump had previously denied having the power to bring Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to his home in Maryland. Pressed by an interviewer from ABC News on Tuesday, he conceded he \"could\" change the situation if he wanted to. \nHowever, he argued that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda had been rightfully deported.\nTrump also said that a government lawyer who had previously made the admission that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda had been deported in error \"should not have said that\".\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was among more than 250 Venezuelans and Salvadorans deported under Trump to a mega-prison in El Salvador in March, as part of what the White House portrayed as a crackdown on foreign criminals. Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was then moved to a different facility. \nSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele has similarly said he will not send Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to the US.\nIn the ABC sit-down, broadcast on Tuesday, interviewer Terry Moran pointed out that Trump could change things with a simple phone call. \n\"I could,\" responded the US president, before going on to say: \"And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that.\"\nTrump insisted that the deportee was not \"innocent\", but instead a member of the notorious Salvadoran gang MS-13. Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has denied this.\nIn a testy exchange, Trump also restated his claim that Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda had MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles. \nThis appeared to be a reference to an image of Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's hand that has been digitally labelled, and promoted by the White House, to try to explain the meaning of several symbols inked on the man's fingers.\nExperts who previously spoke to BBC Verify have cast doubt on the claim that these tattoos mean what Trump and his team allege. \nThe M, S, 1 and 3 appear to have been added to the image previously displayed by Trump - as they do not appear on other images of Mr Abrego Garcia's hands.\nChallenged by ABC over whether his administration was complying with the Supreme Court's order to facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return, Trump pointed out that he had entered the US illegally in the first place.\nMr Abrego Garcia has acknowledged entering the US illegally from El Salvador in 2012, according to court documents. But he was granted an order in 2019 that prevented the US government from sending him back.\nTrump also referred to an allegation of physical abuse made against Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by his wife. Howver, earlier this month, Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's wife said she had not followed a court process against her husband, and appealed for him to be brought home.\nThe interview marked 100 days of his second term in the White House, which was also celebrated by Trump in a major speech in Michigan on Tuesday night.\nSpeaking to ABC, Trump defended his broader stance towards immigration and stood by his plan for wide-ranging trade tariffs which have caused turbulence in the global financial markets.\nHe insisted his plan for taxes on imports of goods to the US would yield \"great times\" rather than hard times, while saying he had braced Americans for a \"transition period\".\nHe also stressed that he had faith in his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, after reports detailing Hegseth's use of group chats on the Signal app to discuss sensitive military operations. He stopped short, however, of saying it was absolute.\nAsked if he had 100% confidence in his official, he said: \"I don't have 100% confidence in anything.\" He went on to call it a \"stupid question\".",

        "article_text": "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.\nThe main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.\nLast Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.\nIn the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.\nThere is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations. \nWhile violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.\nTourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.\nAt a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.\nOther tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.\nAfter a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.\nAmong those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".\n\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.\nBut uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.\nIndian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.\nIndia and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.\nThe escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.\nIndian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.\nTop leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.\n\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.\nThe cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.\n\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"\nThe attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.\nThe timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.\nThe region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.\n\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.\nAs the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.\nIn an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.\nHe said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.\n\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?\n\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.",

Everybody who knows anything about motor racing will recognise this car.\n\"When you look at the modern cars, they're so big and so complicated, this is like the polar opposite. They're small, they're simple and it makes you sort of sit on the road with a rocket on your back.\" \nBruno also competed in Formula 1, from 2010 to 2012, and believes modern drivers are \"spoiled\" when it comes to the machinery provided for them.\nHe stepped into the Lotus at the Goodwood 82nd Members' Meeting and described it as a \"real visceral experience\".\nThe 41-year-old said: \"I raced in modern cars my whole life and they are so refined, so simple and easy. When you drive these things it's such a stressful experience because the smallest mistake you make and it's game over.\"\n1985: Ayrton Senna and his Lotus F1 car\nSporting Witness: The fatal crash of Ayrton Senna\nKeeping the Ayrton Senna brand and legacy alive\nAyrton Senna beat Alain Prost and Keke Rosberg at the 1985 Portuguese GP\nOn 1 May, it will be exactly 31 years since Ayrton Senna died in a crash at the Tamburello corner at Imola at the age of only 34.\nHe was given a state funeral and his memory lives on thanks to the work of the Instituto Ayrton Senna, which was founded by his sister.\n\"In all sports people remember the greatest, but Ayrton sort of went above that. He was someone people connected with on the very personal side, rather than just admiring a successful sportsman,\" said Bruno.\n\"I think it's mostly because of what he stood for, what he believed in and how strongly he carried that message.\n\"When you see young kids born decades after Ayrton passed away being so passionate about him, it's because their parents or grandparents carry this on and they identify with this.\"\nHe continued: \"It's amazing that this legacy stays so strong. We are very proud of it because we believe the world needs a lot of Ayrton's values to be a better place, and the 30th anniversary (of his death) last year was a huge celebration of his legacy.\"\nBruno Senna drove in other championships including Formula E, sports cars and endurance racing\nBruno was only 18 months old when his uncle triumphed at Estoril, a victory that always remained special throughout his career.\n\"He'd always been someone who puts so much pressure on himself to deliver and I think this moment allowed him to get into his own groove and then achieve everything he achieved afterwards,\" he said.\n\"When I was three or four years old I remember watching his races but by then he was with McLaren. I didn't watch many of these Lotus races live, I watched them on replays but always the family was rooting for him back home.\n\"He was my hero and I was driving go-karts when I was five years old, so obviously I was trying to follow in his footsteps from a very early age.\"\nBruno was always fascinated to hear his uncle speak about Prost and his other rivals.\n\"In Portuguese you have so many specific expressions that don't mean anything in other languages, but he had so much respect for Alain, even at the height of their rivalry.\n\"It was a lot of fun talking to him about some races where something went wrong or something went right, he understood the challenge he had from his opponents and the whole racing career built him to what he was.\"\nSo how did it feel for him to step behind the wheel of the Lotus 97T at Goodwood, apart from the difficulty of fitting into the driver's seat?\n\"I think the moment you kind of feel emotional about it is when you do the in-lap and you're just cruising around, cooling the car.\n\"Then you can sort of interact with the crowd a little bit and see what their faces are expressing. It means so much to the people.... a lot of them never even saw this car on the race track and having this opportunity really is a special thing.\nHe added: \"We're so happy the classic Team Lotus keep this car in such great shape, but the human element here is as important as the machine.\"\nListen to The Motorsport Show on BBC Radio Northampton at 6pm on Tuesday.",

        "article_text": "A new Apple TV+ series explores the life of the so-called \"King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings\" \u2013 shown as a wild enfant terrible in post-Revolutionary France who blazed a trail for future generations of cooks.\nIt's described as \"the story of the first celebrity chef\". The French language series Car\u00eame is a dramatisation of the life of Antonin Car\u00eame, who was born into poverty in pre-Revolutionary Paris around 1784. His talent would make him chef for the French diplomat Charles Talleyrand, the Emperor Napoleon, the future George IV of Britain, Tsar Alexander of Russia and the Baron de Rothschild. He also wrote celebrated cookbooks and introduced the Toque (the tall chef's hat), still in use today \u2013 giving birth to the very idea of the \"celebrity\" chef.\nIndeed, Benjamin Voisin, the actor playing Antonin Car\u00eame, believes that if the chef had been working in the 2020s, \"he'd have been the one with 100 million views on TikTok. That would be the equivalent of what he did at the time,\" he tells the BBC.\nAnd Voisin's portrayal of Car\u00eame feels modern; he plays him with a touch of the rock star as well as kitchen chef. He wears an earring, his clothes seem to owe more to the 1980s New Romantic movement than 19th-Century costume, and from his affairs with women to his lack of deference to his so-called superiors, he is what could be described (in French) as an enfant terrible. He is also confident, brash and authoritative in his kitchen \u2013 a manner that echoes 21st-Century celebrity chefs such as Gordon Ramsay.\u00a0\nThe series is inspired by a biography of Car\u00eame and his gastronomy by Ian Kelly, who also co-created the series with screenwriter Davide Serino. The historical figure of the young chef is actually described by Kelly in his book as a \"bookish innocent\" when he takes his first job, but Voisin's look in the series isn't too far from Kelly's description of Car\u00eame aged 25: \"He was handsome, his hair cut and tousled forward in the fashionably Byronic manner... he was described as slight, and a slight eater.\" Kelly also describes Car\u00eame as \"ambitious, solipsistic, even narcissistic\" as a person \u2013 although the Car\u00eame on screen risks much for those he loves.\nIndeed, perhaps inevitably, the series takes various liberties with the truth, also depicting Car\u00eame as a spy for his powerful masters, something there's no historical evidence for. The show's lead director Martin Bourboulon describes the added drama as \"the charm of fiction in the show\". The reality is that the real man didn't leave much information behind. As Kelly says in his biography, \"He [Car\u00eame] would disclose the minutiae of his professional life\u2026 and the menus, guests and ingredients that made up his working days. But about his personal life he revealed nothing.\"\nWhat is true to the era is the depiction of the aristocratic kitchens he worked in, his small army of staff, and their fevered preparations for royal banquets. He's seen in the series organising a meal for Napoleon Bonaparte, and in real life he was responsible for the Emperor's wedding cake. Car\u00eame's ability to sugar-sculpt led to extraordinary creations in the shape of classical lyres and Venetian gondolas, all carefully sketched out on paper first by the chef himself. But that wasn't all he was capable of, according to Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University.\n\"He helped establish a routine for how kitchens were run,\" Freedman tells the BBC. \"He also defined dishes and the repertoire of sauces, what was considered to go with what food, what kind of garnishes would be standard, and the kind of multi-course dining that would come to be characteristic [of haute cuisine]. And as his original metier was confectionery and sugar sculpting, even having a centrepiece of sculpted food is owed to Car\u00eame.\"\u00a0\nWhile some of the real-life recipes in his cookbooks still sound mouthwatering (Kelly mentions an orange flower and pink champagne jelly), others, such as a stuffed boar's head, might seem strange to today. But Bourboulon says that, above all, he wanted to make the chef himself accessible to a modern audience.\nBourboulon, responsible for two successful film adaptations of Alexandre Dumas's historical novel The Three Musketeers, tells the BBC that he wanted to avoid \"the usual period drama style\" in this story.\n\"I really wanted to bring a bit of sexiness, rock 'n' roll attitude, and a modern twist for all the main characters, especially Car\u00eame,\" he says. \"And Benjamin Voisin is like this in real life.\"\nVoisin says their idea of the chef was that he had \"a Mick Jagger aspect to him. It's really what attracted me\".\n\"I love looking to the historical story of Car\u00eame, but this rock star element, that kind of Lenny Kravitz look he has, plus the idea the show gives about his attitude to life, is really important. Maybe that's why Martin came to me to talk about playing him. I also love the story of this young man trying to find his place in society.\"\nThe historical Car\u00eame's stellar career might well have given him a swagger; he was known as \"the King of Chefs and the Chef of Kings\". He's often credited as\u00a0a founder of French gastronomy and of\u00a0Grande Cuisine\u00a0(classic French cuisine which was at its most lavish during the 19th Century).\nHowever, according to\u00a0Paul Freedman, Professor of History at Yale University, he might not even be France's first celebrity chef. The Frenchman\u00a0Guillaume Tirel, known as \"Taillevent\", is famous for cooking for French kings during his lifetime (1310-95), and wrote a cookbook that still survives, The Viandier. Several\u00a0restaurants\u00a0still bear his name.\u00a0\nCar\u00eame's status is, he says, \"a celebrity chef of modern Europe, but still almost the last of a kind. He lived still in the time of the courts and chefs finding aristocratic patrons. He doesn't have a restaurant or interact with ordinary people, [and] his tremendous number of cookbooks aren't directed towards amateurs, but towards other chefs.\n\"So he's a transitional point to the purely modern celebrity chef, who are celebrities in the sense of media exposure, their television presence or just their ability to be a character and to run a restaurant.\"\nThe young Car\u00eame's turnaround in life was remarkable. Historian Ian Kelly describes him in his biography, Car\u00eame: The First Celebrity Chef (which inspired the series) as one of multiple children in a family from one of Paris's worst slums. By 1792, around the same time that\u00a0 the \"Reign of Terror\" would begin in the French Revolution (a period of state-sanctioned violence and executions) he had been abandoned by his parents but was taken in by a cook, and then apprenticed to a notable p\u00e2tissier, Sylvain Bailly. While still a very young man, he was hired by one of the most famous politicians of the Napoleonic era: Prince Charles Maurice Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord, known as Talleyrand.\nEven if the real Car\u00eame didn't dabble in espionage, Bourboulon points out that the chef's culinary brilliance would have been exploited as a display of power by his employers, and that food would have been as much a part of diplomacy during the early 19th Century as the modern state banquet is now.\n\"We know that Car\u00eame worked for Prince of Talleyrand and for Napoleon,\" he tells the BBC. \"It's so French to share the menu, the food, and use the quality of the food to help diplomatic relationships, and historically, they really did do this. There's an example at the end of the first episode, when Car\u00eame brings in a dessert for Napoleon and an English diplomat seated at the same table. And it's exactly how we imagine it would have been done during that time.\"\nPolitics isn't the only display of passion in the narrative either, or as Bourboulon says, \"Love is as important in the lives of French people, possibly more so\". The visuals directly link the food Car\u00eame cooks with sensuality; the camera lingers over the dishes, while red fruit drips over the title sequence. The series even starts with Car\u00eame licking cream off his love interest Henriette, played by Lyna Khoudri.\u00a0\n\"The parallel between the two types of pleasure is there in the series,\" Voisin says. \"Hands are involved in both cooking and the pleasures of the flesh, that's the connection.\"\nThe link between French food and sensuality are linked was certainly there in Car\u00eame's Paris. Ian Kelly describes how the post-Revolution capital \"had become the City of Light \u2013 and the capital of food\". The talk around the young Car\u00eame, he says, would have been \"of philosophy, fashion, food and sex: what the world has come to expect from Paris\".\nCar\u00eame's fame grew across Europe because of his celebrity clientele, but he also benefited from France's growing interest in gastronomy as culture (he was also a contemporary of gourmet Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, celebrated for writing about the art of eating) and the idea that French cuisine was superior because of the sensuality of its people, Paul Freedman says.\n\"I think it goes back to the image that France continues to have today as pleasure-loving, as sophisticated, not merely gorging themselves or getting drunk, but [possessed of] a kind of sensuality that is cultivated in the sense it's tasteful and distinguished,\" he tells the BBC.\nA French chef, he explains, would become necessary as a status symbol for many aristocrats of the 19th and 20th Century. \"One of the biggest examples in literature is PG Wodehouse writing about one of Bertie Wooster's aunts, Dahlia, living in terror that her temperamental French chef, Anatole, would quit.\"\nThe era of the celebrity restaurant chef was ushered in by Car\u00eame's growing fame, and the cookbooks he wrote, according to Professor Nathalie Cooke, the author of Tastes and Traditions: A Journey Through Menu History. Before the French Revolution, restaurants existed in limited form in Paris, but most served only soup. Their proliferation, Cooke tells the BBC, was born from \"economic disaster\".\u00a0\n\"Imagine you're an aspiring young chef and you're working in Paris in the late 18th Century, and they've beheaded Marie Antoinette, and they're getting rid of all those jobs that you've aspired to, cooking for royalty and the aristocracy,\" she says. \"That's why the restaurant culture grew: these very skilled chefs needed to make money and find an audience during economic turbulence, and in a post-royalty age. That's also why Car\u00eame wrote cookbooks: he was establishing himself in this new age of print media, but also, by addressing his work to other chefs, he was training a new breed of chef that was going to serve a larger audience instead of just royalty.\"\nA later French celebrity chef who dominated European food culture, Auguste Escoffier, (1846-1935) \u2013 who ran restaurants at the Ritz hotels in Europe, and at the Savoy Hotel and Carlton Club in London \u2013 \"is really Car\u00eame's heir,\" Cooke says.\n\"Escoffier really becomes famous when he decides to write down formal French cooking methods,\" she explains. \"He was able to achieve Car\u00eame's vision [of making recipes accessible to other chefs] in a way that Car\u00eame could not, because Car\u00eame was living in the age of the birth of restaurant culture, which was only just developing and only in Paris. Escoffier took it to London too.\" (Car\u00eame did spend time in England, serving the then Prince Regent, later George IV, but although he cooked for Tsar Alexander of Russia in Paris, he refused to move there and take a job.)\nThe emergence of TV and radio (and later internet) in the 20th Century has meant that the celebrity chef has become an international phenomenon, not just confined to those writing cookbooks or running restaurants, but open to all those with a knack for connecting with their audience. The most famous chef of the television era, Julia Child, (portrayed by Meryl Streep in the 2009 film Julie and Julia) was an American who had lived in Paris, and a devotee of French cooking. She even received the Antonin Car\u00eame Medal for excellence, although this is a US, not a French, honour.\nIn another nod to modernity, the young Car\u00eame in the series is also shown taking part in a chef's competition, normalised now by the growth of shows such as Iron Chef, MasterChef, and The Great British Bake Off (which streams internationally as The Great British Baking Show.) While the latter's \"Showstopper\" category might trace its ancestry back to Car\u00eame's own sugar sculptures of the 19th Century, the first modern professional event of this kind for chefs started in 1983, when another chef, Paul Bocuse, established the Bocuse D'Or, in Lyon, France.\nBut now that TV shows, podcasting and social media also allow skilled amateurs to become celebrities, Paul Freedman says there are characteristics of how he discerns a truly \"celebrity\" chef\u00a0\n\"My definition in books and articles that I've written is that the contemporary celebrity chef is distinguished by being regarded as a genius or an artist, [as opposed to] people who are [just] excellent at their craft. The Frenchman Paul Bocuse would be the first celebrity chef according to that definition, in the 1980s. Even before he invents dishes, he created the ethos of the chef as genius, and a version of a creative artist. So the celebrity chefs of our era are excellent at their craft, but Ferran Adri\u00e0, who was at El Bulli, or Ren\u00e9 Redzepi of Noma, or Heston Blumenthal in Britain are all [also] creative geniuses, or at least that's how they're presented.\"\u00a0\nThere is though, a direct line traceable from their creations, and their kitchens, to those of Antonin Car\u00eame \u2013 and not just because some of them might still wear a Toque. Bourboulon hopes that this new portrayal of the chef, nearly 200 years after he died, will give his legacy new attention.\u00a0\n\"Although Car\u00eame's name is quite famous in France, it could be even more famous, I think,\" he says. \"I would love people to rediscover, or just discover, what he did, how this young man brought all his talents to the tables of these powerful men like Napoleon. His life is a really exciting thing to mix together \u2013 food, love and politics.\"\u00a0\nCar\u00eame premieres globally on Apple TV+ from April 30, 2025.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, and\u00a0Instagram.",

Slot has led Liverpool to a 20th league title.\nBut, while the Dutchman has been the mastermind behind Liverpool's campaign this season, his success - as he highlighted following his team's confirmation as champions on Sunday - is also due to the squad and culture created by Klopp.\nThe Reds only added one player to their ranks for this campaign in Federico Chiesa and, despite him only playing a bit-part role, they have equalled the title tally of arch-rivals Manchester United.\nBBC Sport - through a documentary on BBC iPlayer about Liverpool's journey to winning the Champions League in 2018-2019 - charts how Klopp ended up with the Reds and how he created the foundations for Slot to build on.\nWhen Liverpool were looking for a manager to replace Brendan Rodgers, the \"two main candidates\" - according to former Reds director of research Ian Graham - were Klopp and Carlo Ancelotti, who were both out of work at the time.\nAncelotti was a \"great coach\" but Liverpool didn't have the \"sort of squad\" with \"proven superstars\" that he was used to managing.\nKlopp, on the other hand, had guided a youthful Borussia Dortmund side to the Bundesliga title in 2011 and 2012 and was seen as a better fit.\n\"Our strategy was to recruit young players, have them reach peak age together to give us this success one or two years down the line,\" said Graham.\nKlopp was appointed as Reds boss with the club 10th in the Premier League in October 2015, and he set about instilling a philosophy and principles at the Anfield club which Slot has benefitted from.\n\"We always wanted to create stories which we can tell our grandkids,\" said Peter Krawietz, who had been with Klopp at Mainz and Dortmund before following him to Liverpool and becoming his assistant.\n\"There's only one way. Do it as a team. Do it with your mates.\n\"Use that to make sure we are feeling like friends, like brothers, like a family. Know about the support you need from all the teams around, from the analysts, from the doctor, from the physiotherapists, from the nutritionists.\n\"We can do it only together. As long as you are alone, or you leave others alone, then you don't have a chance.\n\"Keep believing, follow your dream, don't quit. Then one day you will get the bonus. So the idea was always for us to invest everything without expecting a guarantee for success.\"\nHow to Win the Champions League\nLiverpool\nSuccess in the form of silverware had proved elusive.\nLiverpool had achieved an impressive 97 points in 2018-2019 and, even though that would have won them the league title in most other seasons, they were pipped to the top-flight crown by a point by Manchester City.\nThe Reds had also been beaten in the League Cup final and Europa League final in 2016, as well as the 2018 Champions League final.\nHowever, the work Klopp had done with his players was eventually rewarded when he won the first trophy of his Liverpool reign with a 2-0 victory against Tottenham in the 2019 Champions League final.\nThe club's journey to that trophy embodied the tactics, emotion and thrilling football that was Klopp's hallmark, and one which Slot has refined rather than revolutionised.\n\"The idea is to press the opponent, don't allow them to get into the game,\" said Krawietz. \"They do on the pitch what we allow them to do, being dominant already without having the ball, and then - the moment we win the ball - the first idea is, win it high on the pitch and attack the goal.\n\"We had to adapt over time. It was constantly learning without changing our basic ideas until the end.\"\nHe added: \"We, as the managing staff, were convinced about our way.\n\"We had to convince the players as well and then, the next step is to convince the people around, turning doubters into believers.\"\nKrawietz admitted Klopp's gameplan could be \"wild\" but \"was part of the plan\", and there was no better evidence of it in action than their 2019 Champions League semi-final against Lionel Messi's Barcelona.\nThe Reds looked down and out after losing the first leg 3-0 at the Nou Camp, before what turned out to be one of the most memorable comebacks in Champions League history.\n\"Right after the first game, there was a very decisive moment in the dressing room because Jurgen stood up and said, 'hey, gentlemen, this game is not over yet. We have half-time. Yes, we are 3-0 down, but we are Liverpool and we play next week in our stadium',\" said Krawietz.\n\"For us, football is always playing football as well with your heart. \n\"All the strategy, all the tactics, all the instructions you give to them but, giving the team the possibility to feel the game and the energy of a stadium, the support of each other and bringing the crowd into the game as well in home games, which is possible at Anfield, we knew it and this is what we tried to develop.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'It's like a father hugging the son' - Alisson and Robertson on Klopp's hugs\nLiverpool's in-house data department had given them a 3.5% chance of overcoming Barcelona before the second leg but, as the injured Mohamed Salah's T-shirt read before the match, Klopp's Liverpool 'never give up'.\nDivock Origi pulled one goal back early on for Liverpool and two from Georginio Wijnaldum, who was \"angry like crazy\" at not having started, levelled the tie at 3-3 before 'that' corner.\nWith Barcelona still getting organised for a Liverpool corner, Trent Alexander-Arnold pretended to walk away from the ball before quickly turning and sending in a low ball which Origi swept in to cause scenes of bedlam as Liverpool won 4-0.\n\"I didn't know at the time but our video analysts pay a lot of attention to set-pieces,\" said Graham.\n\"They noticed that this was a recurring theme - when Barcelona concede a corner they are more concerned with arguing amongst themselves than they are defending the corner - and so Divock and Trent had been briefed.\n\"Credit to the video analysts and Trent and Divock for spotting the opportunity and converting it as well.\"\nLiverpool went on to beat Spurs and win Europe's top competition for a sixth time.\n\"It's not hard to play for Jurgen. He's a motivator. He gets you to run through a brick wall for him effectively. The good thing is that he'll do the exact same for you,\" said Liverpool left-back Andy Robertson.\n\"I just think he was probably quite a loving person. He was always just going about the training ground giving hugs.\n\"He wanted everyone to feel a part of it at that time. Going into the training ground was a good place to go. You could see everyone was highly motivated.\"\nKlopp might have gone but his players have proved this season that the atmosphere  he created at Liverpool remains, along with the 'all-for-one-one-for-all' attitude he embedded in his players.\nLiverpool keeper Alisson added: \"Jurgen was always clinical in the words he used before matches. He has this natural talent to set everybody on fire for the game.\"\nHow to win the Champions League: Liverpool 2019\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Within hours of taking his second oath of office, Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders and declarations, and fired the starting gun on what has been a rapid and radical programme of change in his first 100 days.\nSo far, he has shown no sign of taking his foot off the pedal.\nThe sheer quantity of his news-generating actions over the past few months could be seen as a carefully considered strategy. It is one that Steve Bannon, the right-wing podcast host who advised Trump during his first term, first floated as long ago as 2018.\n\"The Democrats don't matter,\" Bannon told the writer Michael Lewis at the time. \"The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone.\"\nSo seven years on, with Trump back in the Oval Office and the zone not just flooded but virtually submerged, does Bannon think the strategy has worked?\n\"Flooding the Zone' is an overwhelming success,\" he tells me via text. \"The biggest victory is a broken globalist media that finds itself too frayed to cover our assault on the institutions of America's oppression.\"\nIt is a typically bombastic response. A wide variety of opinion polls, however, suggest the public is less enthusiastic. Trump's overall approval rating at this stage of his presidency, for example, is the lowest of any president in the past 80 years, according to a joint ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released on the weekend.\nIn his usual fashion, Trump hit out at \"fake polls from fake news organisations\".\nBut do they suggest ailing support that could pose a problem for him down the line?\nIt is still early, of course, and Trump's base remains fully committed. Even so, the best laid plans of even the most cautious politicians can go awry. So after 100 days of action, is there anything that could derail Trump's promised agenda in the coming months?\nHere are three potential scenarios.\nTrump has spent many years talking about the good that tariffs could do for America's economy \u2013 and now he is trying to make it a reality.\nBut staking your presidency on a policy of global economic disruption comes with significant risks.\nTrump has already reacted to tanking global markets by announcing tariff pauses, and he has signalled he is ready to make a deal with China by recently making warmer comments than the earlier angry barbs aimed at Beijing.\nBut in July, steep tariffs on imports from any countries that do not have a trade deal with the US are set to come into force.\nCan the administration really agree 90 trade deals in 90 days as Trump has promised? If not, the president may find that his tariff regime and the potential for more market chaos begins to further shake his standing with voters.\nVoters who backed the president in November, at least many I have spoken to, appreciate the White House message that he is standing up to countries that have for decades taken advantage of the US and seeking to inject fresh life into American manufacturing.\nBut there is a tension between this message and what plays out on the ground -  not in diplomatic talks between leaders, but on main streets and in supermarkets as Americans go about their daily lives.\nTrump's tariff plans have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. And a poll by CBS News on Monday indicated there is a growing belief among voters that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices.\nThis feels key to the success of the Trump administration in coming months. Ambitions to reset the global trading order are one thing - and a popular one among the president's supporters at that - but handing the cost of this to the average American consumer by increasing taxes on virtually all imports is dangerous politically, even more so if the country were to tip into recession.\nImmigration has always been Trump's signature issue. He enjoys higher approval ratings on it than any other policy area, with polls suggesting a significant number of voters support his swift actions to deport thousands of undocumented migrants.\nAs the administration pursues this immigration crackdown, it may not be the views of voters that hamper Trump, but rulings from the nation's courts. Judges are repeatedly telling the White House that its actions may be in breach of the law.\nThe case of one man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, has already made it to the Supreme Court. The administration has admitted it made a mistake when deporting him to a notorious prison in El Salvador, but appears unwilling to follow a Supreme Court order to \"facilitate\" his return to the US.\nSo far, the White House has avoided the kind of clash with judges that could prompt a full-blown constitutional crisis, even as it has maneuvered around court rulings aimed at limiting some of its most radical policy moves. But a showdown may happen soon.\nThe ultimate confrontation, of course, would come if Trump chose to ignore an order from the Supreme Court.\nUntil now the administration has been happy to argue about deportations in the court of public opinion, convinced that voters are much more concerned about removing illegal immigrants from the country than they are about due process.\nMike Madrid, a Republican political consultant, agrees. He told me that, in his view, many people do not believe undocumented migrants deserve legal rights. \n\"If you frame it between giving them due process and getting terrorist gang members... Republicans are going to side with getting MS-13 members off the streets,\" he said.\nStill, public support for Trump's immigration moves could be slipping. A poll published late last week indicated his approval rating on the issue had fallen by 10 points in recent weeks.\nEven if voters are prepared to accept the White House ignoring court rulings, any such move could pose a significant challenge to many Republican members of Congress who feel squeamish about it. So far, the party's senators and representatives have virtually given Trump free rein to do whatever he likes. But could they remain silent when faced with a president defying the law?\nElon Musk and his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" have not wasted a minute of these 100 days, taking their chainsaw to large parts of the federal workforce and cutting government spending including on international aid.\nAs with much of Trump's agenda, there is a tension between the very real voter sympathy for the message - in this case, that the government is bloated, wasteful and inefficient - versus the extreme actions sometimes taken by the White House to address that message.\nAnd with DOGE, the political risk for the president could come if it begins to cut government spending and programmes that voters readily rely on. That is a real risk, as the anger at Musk is already bubbling up.\nMany elected Republicans have stopped holding open meetings for constituents, known as town halls, after being confronted by angry voters who are worried about cuts to their pensions or government-funded healthcare. \nTensions are also running high within Trump's cabinet over Musk's interference, culminating in a heated shouting match in the West Wing recently between the billionaire adviser and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nThe reality is that Musk is considerably less popular than Trump, and his expensive effort to influence a special election in Wisconsin fell completely flat with voters.\nThe tech billionaire will soon have to leave the president's side. He is under pressure from Tesla shareholders to return to his struggling car company, and as a \"special government employee\" he faces time limits on working within this administration. There is a world in which less-frequent appearances at the White House could prove to be in the best interests of Trump.\nBut while Musk may be leaving, DOGE is expected to continue its work until July 2026. That leaves plenty of opportunities for it to make deeply unpopular spending cuts, which is undoubtedly a longer-term political risk for this White House, especially ahead of next year's mid-term elections.\nFor now, however, Trump's 100-day blitz of orders, actions and noise has steamrolled opposition and proved popular with his loyal base, who say he is simply doing what he promised. \nThose risks, however, are there - and with an administration as unpredictable and fast-moving as this one, the potential for a crisis never truly goes away.",

That is what Barcelona and Inter Milan served up in an enthralling 3-3 draw in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.\n\"It was an amazing battle to watch, almost like a boxing match where opposing styles make the fight,\" said former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock.\n\"Barca and Inter were set up very differently, and it made for one heck of a game.\"\nFormer Rangers striker Ally McCoist said on TNT Sport: \"Tonight was just special, special to be here to watch those two teams.\n\"We have been treated to some unbelievable football this evening.\"\nSensational goals, high drama and incredible individual performances - it had everything. Here's how an engrossing evening of football unfolded.\nMuch of the talk in the build-up to this match was around Barcelona.\nTheir dangerous high line, their ability to score an abundance of goals with a prolific front three, the prospect of another golden generation of players nurtured from their prestigious La Masia academy.\nAfter 30 seconds of the first leg at the Montjuic Olympic Stadium, that all changed.\nMarcus Thuram's clever backheel finish was the fastest goal to be scored in a Champions League semi-final and left the home crowd stunned.\nBut against a side capable of scoring lots of goals, Inter knew one would not be enough and the second came on 21 minutes when Denzel Dumfries fired in a remarkable overhead kick to once again silence the home crowd.\nThat was not in the script for a Barcelona side trying to reach the Champions League final for the first time in 10 years.\n\"I think everyone thought that once Inter went 2-0 up, that would be it \u2013 they would shut up shop, and we wouldn't see much other than another outstanding defensive display by them,\" said Warnock.\nInter had conceded just five goals in this season's Champions League and with Barcelona's high-line tactics exposing their own defensive weaknesses, the Serie A side were able to take advantage.\nFor a few minutes, at least.\nTrailing by two after 21 minutes, Barcelona needed an immediate spark.\nEnter Lamine Yamal.\nThe teenager, making his 100th club appearance, took just three minutes to step up for his team and conjure a moment of magic to get them back in it.\nJinking into the penalty box and leaving Henrikh Mkhitaryan in his wake, Yamal struck a majestic left-footed finish that ricocheted off the post and into the net to launch the comeback.\n'Get the ball to Yamal' became a clear tactic for Barcelona and watching him take control of the game, pinging balls into the area and constantly making himself available in forward positions, it was easy to forget he is still just 17 years old.\nThe equaliser came on 38 minutes, when Ferran Torres stabbed in from close range after Raphinha nodded on Pedri's diagonal cross.\nParity restored just in time for the break, the anticipation was heavy after what had been a mesmerising opening 45 minutes.\nFormer Liverpool player Steve McManaman, part of the TNT punditry team, said: \"It had everything. It showed how frail Barcelona are defensively, but going forward they are electric.\"\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nThis video can not be played\nYamal pulls one back against Inter\nWith fans and neutrals alike on the edge of their seats from this gripping encounter, expectations were high for an equally entertaining second half.\nAfter three stunning goals worthy of putting any team in the Champions League final, there was almost an air of disappointment when Inter's goal to restore their advantage came from a simple corner routine.\nDumfries rose highest to meet Hakan Calhanoglu's corner at the back post, highlighting Barca's defensive struggles.\n\"Inter are not the most dynamic team, and they don't have much raw pace but there was still a way for them to hurt Barca, on the break or with set-pieces,\" said Warnock.\n\"They are the oldest squad in the Champions League so there is a lot of experience there and they showed that tonight with the way they were clever enough to keep opening Barca up.\"\nAt 30 years and 56 days, Inter named the seventh oldest starting XI for a Champions League semi-final game and they used all of that experience to keep cool heads in a high-drama scenario.\n\"When you play at home like we did, the sensation is that we should have managed to earn a better result,\" Barcelona forward Raphinha told Movistar Plus.\n\"We can't concede that many goals, especially at home. Sure, you have to give praise to our opponents who are strong and played well tonight but we are Barca and it's our duty to win at home, that's how it is.\"\nSmarting from three consecutive defeats in the past seven days, where they have dropped to second in Serie A and gone out of the Coppa Italia to city rivals AC Milan, Inter were determined not to let the lead slip away again.\n\"Barca were set up to attack and take the game to Inter but their high-line left them vulnerable at the back,\" said Warnock.\n\"They are not going to change that way of playing - they haven't changed all season and they have done well doing it, so why would they?\"\nConceding three goals at home and facing the prospect of travelling to the San Siro with a one-goal deficit, sometimes all you need is someone to take a chance.\nThat is what Raphinha did when he picked up the ball 25 yards out and hammered the ball into the back of the net, via a touch off the bar and goalkeeper Yann Sommer's back.\nInter had held the lead for all of 114 seconds before Raphinha's equaliser drew Barcelona level for the second time in the game.\nYamal might have been the star of the show on Wednesday but it is Raphinha who has dominated the headlines for Barca throughout this campaign and, although the goal has not been credited to the Brazilian, his performances throughout have proved pivotal to their success.\n\"I really appreciate what we did today,\" said Barcelona boss Hansi Flick.\n\"We played a great game, and of course, the goals we conceded weren't pretty. You have to talk about them, analyse them, but the way we played, our style, our way of playing...it was fantastic.\"\nMkhitaryan thought he had found a fourth goal when he poked home in the 75th minute only for the video assistant referee to rule it out for an agonisingly tight offside.\nBut even without that, the game was the joint-highest score draw in a Champions League semi-final game alongside a 3-3 draw between Dynamo Kyiv and Bayern Munich in the first leg in 1998-99.\nIt sets up a mouth-watering second leg in Milan next week and, while Barca may be disappointed to have conceded three goals at home, the visitors will take confidence that they were able to match them on an exhilarating night of football.\n\"After three defeats in a row we saw the real Inter tonight,\" said Inter goalscorer Dumfries. \n\"We played with heart and I'm proud.

        "article_text": "When Alberto Salagan was deported from the US in January it was the first time he'd stepped foot in Mexico since he was a baby.\nBorn in the coastal resort of Acapulco, his parents took him to the US when he was just six months old.\nGrowing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life.\nAfter his arrest in San Diego for gang activity, Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as President Trump was taking office, and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth.\n\"It was a shock. It still is,\" he admits. \"When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing.\"\n\nAlberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. \"Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],\" he reflects.\nIn fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company \u2013 EZ Call Center \u2013 was looking for English-speakers.\nThe work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved.\n\"I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,\" he tells me during a break between calls.\nAlmost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz.\nHe was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico.\n\"We are all dealing with culture shock,\" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls.\n\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"\nIn their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.\nAll the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.\nDaniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.\n\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.\nDaniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.\nAs well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.\nAfter his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".\nHe has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.\nMexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.\nSo far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing. \nThe latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year. \nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.\nHowever, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.\nThe threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.\nThe Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.\nStill, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.\nThe few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.\nBeyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce. \nWith its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.\n\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"\nNora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.\n\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.\nThe \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.\nHe grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.\n\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,\" Luis explains.\nWhile in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.\nNow 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.\n\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"\nFor Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.\n\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.\nWhile the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.\nIf so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes.\nIn Tijuana, many of them will find it at the end of a telephone line.",

Quite fun.\"\nBut in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.\nInternet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.\nEventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.\nAs Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.\nPlatforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.\nThe payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"\nPlatforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.\nSo, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.\nBut while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.\nMr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"\nYet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.\nMr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.\n\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".\nDr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.\nAnd it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.\nBut modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.\nHe says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".\nMr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"\nBut these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"\nBut the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.\n\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"\nDr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".\nIn the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"\nThat is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

        "article_text": "The government has made very little progress in preparing the UK for the growing threats posed by rising temperatures since coming to power, its climate watchdog has warned.\nIn a highly critical report, the independent Climate Change Committee says progress is \"either too slow, has stalled, or is heading in the wrong direction\".\nFrom hospitals and care homes to food and water supplies, this could leave the UK vulnerable to serious economic and health impacts in the decades ahead, the CCC warns.\nIn response, the government pointed to its investment in flood defences, but acknowledged more work was needed. \nFloods Minister Emma Hardy told BBC News that preparing for the changing climate was \"something we're really committed to\".\n\"We are putting \u00a32.65bn into upgrading, maintaining and building new flood defences.\n\"But we absolutely know, of course, there's more that needs to be done.\"\nFuelled by climate change, the UK's weather extremes are intensifying, from the 40C heat of July 2022 to England's wettest 18 months on record between October 2022 to March 2024.\nSuch events are only likely to become more severe and happen more often, as the planet continues to get hotter due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases.\nBetter preparation can limit the damage by making the country more resilient, but the CCC says this is not happening at anywhere near the required pace.\n\"We are seeing climate impact happening faster and more intensely and increasing [but] government just doesn't yet seem to be taking it seriously,\" Baroness Brown, chair of the Adaptation Committee at the CCC, told BBC News.\n\"The manifesto said it was going to address this issue of resilience and yet, so far, it's done nothing,\" she added.\n\"We've heard some warm words\u2026 but nothing has come out yet.\"\nNone of the 46 areas assessed were found to be making \"good\" progress in adapting to climate change. Only three had \"good\" plans and policies in place for the future.\nThese are mostly unchanged from the CCC's last report in 2023.\nHealth is one of the areas that remains most poorly prepared.\nThe CCC points to the rising number of deaths linked to extreme heat and hospitals themselves being vulnerable to hot weather.\nBaroness Brown highlights the case of Guy's and St Thomas', the biggest hospital trust in London, which was hit by a failure to its data centres during the extreme heat of July 2022.\nThis meant it was unable to operate its appointments system at a time of intense demand, and it had to move to paper appointments.\n\"We lost thousands of crucial appointments for people for critical tests,\" she said.\n\"We're trying to improve the NHS. Unless we take into account that it has to be resilient to the climate, we're going backwards.\"\nFlooding is another challenging area. Plans and policies to ensure places are resilient to river and coastal flooding are found to have worsened since the CCC's previous report.\nThe ancient town of Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire is a case in point.

We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting\", the museum spokesperson told the BBC. \n\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.\nSophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".\nThis is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.\n\"In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,\" Ms McAloone said.\nThe Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot \u2013 a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum \u2013 as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of \"public favourites\" from the gallery's collection.\nJonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"\n\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said. \nRestoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.\nHe said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.\nConservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.\n\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.\nRothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.\nUmaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.\nDuring his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.\nRachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".\nThis includes \"accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions\", she said.\nShe said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum. \nThe loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.\nThe museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.\nThe Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.\nIn 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.\nSharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: \"It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.\"\nThe Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.\nRothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 painting is one of several works of modern art that have been damaged in the Netherlands in recent years.\nIn November 2024, multiple screen prints by the US pop artist Andy Warhol were damaged by thieves during an attempted robbery of the MPV art gallery in the town of Oisterwijk.\nIn another incident, a Dutch town hall admitted it \"most likely\" disposed of 46 artworks by accident \u2013 including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen \u2013 during renovation works last year.\nMuseums have different policies when responding to damage caused by children.\nIn August last year, a four-year-old boy accidentally smashed a 3,500-year-old jar into pieces at the Hecht Museum in Israel.\nAt the time, Hecht Museum worker Lihi Laszlo told the BBC the museum would not treat the incident \"with severity\" because \"the jar was accidentally damaged by a young child\".\nThe family were invited back to the exhibition with his family for an organised tour shortly after the incident occurred.",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney's Liberals have won Canada's federal election - riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment to form the next government.\nIt is a stunning political turnaround for a party who were widely considered dead and buried just a few months ago.  \nIt's not yet clear if the party - which has been in power for almost a decade - will be able to secure a majority as results continue to roll in. \nEither way, the prime minister faces major challenges, including divisions in the country laid bare by the campaign. \nHere are five takeaways from an election which saw the Conservative opposition make major gains but still lose. \nThere is no doubt the US president's tariff threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty played an outsized role in this election, suddenly making leadership and the country's economic survival the defining issues of the campaign.\nMark Carney used it to his advantage, running as much against Trump as he did against his main opposition rival, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.\nCarney warned Canada was at a crisis moment, saying frequently on the campaign trail - and in his victory speech - that Trump \"wants to break us so America can own us\".\nPoilievre brought Trump up much less frequently during the campaign, focusing his message on domestic issues - the cost of living, the housing affordability crisis, and crime - and targeting the Liberals for their record on those matters.\nCarney - who has declared the old relationship with the US \"over\" - plans to start negotiations on a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election.\nKevin O'Leary, a Canadian businessman close to Trump who previously ran for the Conservative leadership, acknowledged it was a successful campaign strategy.\n\"Right now Canadians are very frustrated with America and Carney has used that to his advantage,\" he told the BBC just before polls closed. \"He was able to distract Canadians from his own mistakes... and say 'Stop looking at that. Look south of the border and I can save you'.\"\nAt the start of the year, Carney was a former central banker with no experience as a politician. By mid-March, he was being sworn in as prime minister - the first to have never held elected public office before - after a resounding win in the Liberal leadership race.\nNow, he's faced the Canadian electorate as a first time campaigner, won an Ottawa-area seat in the House of Commons and steered his party to an unlikely victory.\nCarney had long flirted with entering Canadian politics - and he seized his moment, swooping in after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's sudden resignation in January. \nHe also took full advantage of the new political landscape, leaning into his experience helping Canada and the UK navigate previous crises at a time when Canadians were feeling anxious about their economic future.\nTrump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports gave Carney the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign. He was able to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and bringing together his ministers on the US file.\nIn a different election, this would have been a successful one for the Conservatives.\nIn 2011, the Conservatives won a majority with 39.6% of the vote. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is on track to beat that this time, with roughly 41.4% of the vote with most polls reporting, according to Elections Canada.\nThey are currently projected to have won 144 seats - that's up from 120 at dissolution, when the election was called in March.\nBut with the progressive vote coalescing around the Liberals, those numbers weren't enough this time. \nThe bitter blow was Poilievre losing his riding (parliamentary seat) in Carleton, Ontario.\nOnly months ago his party had a clear path to victory and they will now need to figure out a way forward after a series of electoral defeats.\nWhether that includes the diminished figure of Poilievre as leader is the first big question for them to face.He is the third leader they've had since the Liberals swept the 2015 election.\nThe election results have highlighted divisions in Canada that could pose a challenge for Carney. \nNotably, the Liberals are largely shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan - oil-rich and gas-rich prairie provinces where a sense of alienation from the centre of power in Ottawa has long festered.\nEven before the election, some in those regions were warning of a national unity crisis if the Liberals won another mandate.\nCarney touched on those divisions in his victory speech, acknowledging the millions who had voted for a different outcome. \n\"I intend to govern for all Canadians,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, Poilievre's message, which relentlessly focused on cost of living issues, especially on housing affordability, resonated with many young people.\nSupport for the Conservatives outpaced Liberals by 44% to 31.2% among 18 to 34 year olds, a Nanos poll on 25 April indicated. The divide was more stark among younger men.\nSeparately, Abacus Data polling found that about 18% of 18 to 29 year olds were worried about Trump. That jumped to 45% for voters over 60, suggesting a polarisation on issues between generations. \nOn Monday night, Poilievre remarked on demographic breakthroughs Conservative had made, including with younger Canadians.  \n\"We gave voices to countless people across the country who've been left out and left behind for far too long,\" he said. \nIn this election, the smaller political parties have taken a hit as Canadians choose to park their votes with either the Liberals or the Conservatives - especially the left-wing New Democrats, or NDP. \nSome of the smaller parties have lost a significant amount of vote share - particularly the NDP who have received just 6% of votes counted across Canada so far, compared with 18% in 2021. \nJagmeet Singh, who has been NDP leader for almost eight years, lost his own riding in British Columbia and announced he will step down. \n\"Obviously I know this night is a disappointing night for New Democrats,\" he said, adding: \"We're only defeated if we stop fighting.\"\nThe Greens have also seen their vote share cut in half from 2% to 1%.\nShachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation, told the BBC that Trump's rhetoric was behind the shift to the Liberals.  \n\"The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters,\" she said.\nThe sovereigntist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have maintained a vote share of around 7%. They are on track to win 23 seats in Quebec. \nThis is based on around 97% of polls reporting.\nCanada doesn't have a two-party system, even though it has historically voted in conservative or liberal governments in some form.\nIn the country's political system, these smaller parties still play a role in Parliament. Both the NDP and the Bloc have at some points formed Official Opposition in the House of Commons.",

        "article_text": "Sir Tony Blair has called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is \"doomed to fail\".\nIn a new report, the former Labour prime minister says voters \"feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal\".\nHe does not call for Labour to halt its push to decarbonise the UK economy - but says all governments need to rethink their approach, as it is not working.\nThe Tories - who have joined Reform UK in opposing net zero emissions by 2050 - urged Labour to end the \"mad dash\" to this goal - but Downing Street said it would not be changing course.\nIn its report The Climate Paradox: Why We Need to Reset Action on Climate Change, the Tony Blair Institute argues that global institutions such as COP and the UN have failed to make sufficient progress in halting climate change.\nAt the same time, it argues, the public have lost faith in climate policies because the promised green jobs and economic growth have failed to materialise, thanks in part to global instability and the Covid pandemic.\nWriting in the foreword, Sir Tony says: \"Though most people will accept that climate change is a reality caused by human activity, they're turning away from the politics of the issue because they believe the proposed solutions are not founded on good policy.\"\nHe says \"any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail\".\nHe also warns against the \"alarmist\" tone of the debate on climate change, which he  says is \"riven with irrationality\".\nThe report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors.\nIt also argues for a greater focus on climate change adaptation measures such as flood defences and a new international push to persuade China and India to cut emissions. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, the author of the report dismissed claims that the foundation was rejecting net zero targets, saying it \"is a paper that is about increased climate ambition\".\nLindy Fursman, director of climate and energy policy at the Tony Blair Institute, said:  \"We are certainly not rejecting net zero targets. The paper is really clear that we need to keep these because of the certainty they provide for businesses.\"\nMs Fursman said the report was \"pointing out that while many economies are doing well, we need to do more, particularly in the global picture because global emissions continue to rise\".\nDowning Street said it would not be changing course on net zero - and rejected Sir Tony's suggestions that the public was no longer prepared to make sacrifices to meet green goals.\n\"We will reach net zero in a way that treads lightly on people's lives, not telling them how to live or behave,\" said the prime minister's official spokesman.\n\"Net zero is the economic opportunity of the 21st century, one that has the potential to reignite our industrial heartlands, create good jobs for the future and lower bills in the long term.\"\nThe government claims its net zero strategy is already delivering results, with \u00a343bn of private investment since last July and that its climate policies \"now support around 600,000 jobs across the UK\".\nLabour sources are also pushing back against claims Sir Keir Starmer is going cold on the net zero agenda, pointing to a speech he made last week in which he said the clean energy mission was \"in the DNA of my government\".\nReacting in the Commons to Sir Tony's comments in the report, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he agreed \"with a lot of what it says\" particularly on carbon capture and storage and AI \"which the government are doing\".\nBut Labour's opponents were quick to seize on the former prime minister's words.\nWriting on social media, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Even Tony Blair now says the push for Net Zero has become 'irrational' and 'hysterical'. We are winning the argument!\"\nConservative acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie said the government needed to \"urgently  change course\".\n\"It seems even Tony Blair has come to the realisation that Keir Starmer and the Labour Party's mad dash to net zero by 2050 is simply not feasible, or sustainable,\" he added.\nGreen Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: \"Blair is wrong, both morally and pragmatically. The British public understands the need for decisive climate action and expects politicians to lead in delivering this action.\"\nSir Tony's intervention has also been met with dismay by Labour-supporting environmental groups. \nOne campaigner told the BBC: \"This is an oddly public and oddly-timed intervention that would usually be made by someone struggling for access. \n\"The Labour government are getting on with many of the policies outlined in the report because they know this is popular with people, especially the voting coalition they need to maintain for the next election. \n\"But adopting the anti-net-zero framing of [Tory leader Kemi] Badenoch and Reform is out of step with where the public are on this issue and will not help Labour.\"\nA Liberal Democrats spokesperson said: \"There is no doubt that the last Conservative government set us back by failing to invest in cheap, clean energy and home insulation. \n\"But that makes it all the more important that we act with urgency now, to bring down energy bills and emissions, free ourselves from reliance on Putin's gas, and restore the UK's role as a world-leader in the clean technology of the future and the jobs that go with it.\"\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

We're going to have to do something special in Paris to be there,\" Arteta said.\nPSG dominated the opening 20 minutes of the match and, while the hosts grew into the game, they continued to be frustrated by the French side's solid defence, failing to score in a home Champions League match for the first time since February 2016.\n\"We have a lot of chances to be in that final. As I repeat myself, you have to do something special in the competition to have the right to be in the final. And the time to do it is going to be in Paris,\" said Arteta.\nArsenal have not reached the final since 2005-06 while PSG are hunting a first Champions League trophy.\nAs they did against Liverpool and Aston Villa earlier in the campaign, Luis Enrique's side relied on Italian keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to keep them out of trouble.\nThe 26-year-old kept a clean sheet and made five saves - including important stops to deny Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard in one-on-one situations.\n\"At the end, we have two of our front players one v one with Donnarumma.

        "article_text": "A commercial expedition is planning to take clients up the tallest mountain in the world in record time with the help of xenon gas. But some in the climbing and medical world worry whether the strategy is an unnecessary gamble.\nWhen Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary\u00a0made their first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, it took more than two months of effort to reach the summit. In order to adjust to the extreme thin air at high altitude, the team spent several weeks acclimatising, working their way slowly upwards. After reaching Base Camp, they spent seven weeks making brief forays up and down the mountain to set ropes, lay ladders and establish ever higher camps before their assault on the summit. In short, they laid siege to the mountain.\nToday, the miles of fixed ropes put along the route by teams of Sherpas and the slick logistics perfected by commercial guiding companies allow hundreds of climbers to summit Everest every year. But the time it takes for most to climb Mount Everest hasn't changed dramatically since that first ascent.\nMany expeditions still recommend allowing around two months to reach the top with extensive acclimatisation, although this depends on a range of factors including the weather, traffic on the mountain and the fitness of the climber. It can take up to a week to trek to Base Camp, but once there most people need, on average, around 40 days to reach the summit. But some companies even offer fast-track expeditions that claim to get clients there in as little as two weeks.\nThis season, however, one guiding company has promised to slash the time even further by taking its clients to the top of the world in just one week, starting from an airport in London. They will fly to Kathmandu in Nepal, take a helicopter to Everest base camp and climb the mountain in only a few days. This way, they will skip the usual painstaking three weeks of acclimatisation in the mountains \u2013 all for around \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3127,000/$170,000) per person. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe offer, which raised more than a few eyebrows in the climbing community, came from Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach, who will rely on an unexpected new strategy \u2013 inhaling xenon, a noble gas that is sometimes used as an anaesthetic.\nThe logic behind the idea is relatively simple. Around 10 years ago, it became apparent that xenon has one interesting side effect \u2013 it increases production of a protein called erythropoietin. Known for short as EPO, erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that our kidneys produce as reaction to insufficient oxygen levels. EPO fights hypoxia \u2013 a condition that occurs when the body can't get enough oxygen \u2013 by increasing the number of red blood cells and the crucial protein they carry, haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body. At high altitudes, this process will naturally happen after multiple rounds of going up and down the mountain \u2013 acclimatisation in other words \u2013 to slowly adapt the body to lower oxygen levels.\nBut xenon, it is claimed, could potentially offer a shortcut. By inhaling carefully controlled doses of the gas shortly before the expedition, it may be possible to accelerate the effects of acclimatisation. Furtenbach says he successfully tested xenon himself on previous expeditions. There is, however, little published scientific evidence showing the strategy works. One recent systematic review of the scientific research, for example, found no conclusive evidence that inhaling xenon had a positive effect on the action of EPO in the human body.\n\"Increase in erythropoietin does nothing on its own,\" says Andrew Peacock, an honorary professor specialising in altitude medicine at the University of Glasgow in the UK. \"The question in this case is, does it really stimulate production of red blood cells in such a short period?\"\nFor Furtenbach, the main goal of this strategy is to allow climbers to summit faster and so reduce the risk of being caught in bad weather, avalanches or getting sick.\n\"The less time you spend on the mountain, the safer the expedition becomes,\" he says.\u00a0\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 How tall will Mount Everest get before it stops growing\n\u2022 Death in the clouds: The problem with Everest's bodies\n\u2022 Scientists in Antarctica began developing their own accent\nFurtenbach has a reputation for pushing the limits of what is possible on Everest. He has specialised in offering \"flash\" three-week expeditions, where mountaineers pre-acclimatise at home before making their trip. In the Everest climbing season of 2025, he is planning to use the xenon approach to help four British clients reach the summit in early May.\nMany in the mountaineering community, however, have reacted to his plans with a mix of scepticism and condemnation.\nThe medical commission at the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) \u2013 the umbrella group for mountaineering organisations around the world \u2013 issued a cautionary statement after Furtenbach revealed his plans. It warned of the absence of clinical research or scientific proof about the safety and efficiency of using xenon at high altitudes. A previous assessment by the same body also warned that drugs designed to induce EPO could potentially increase the risk of blood clots capable of triggering strokes or pulmonary embolisms.\nSome climbers have also\u00a0pointed\u00a0out that substances that artificially increase the amount of EPO in the blood \u2013 including xenon \u2013 are\u00a0banned\u00a0by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) in competitive sport.\n\"Why would we use substances in mountaineering that are banned in all other sports,\" says Adrian Ballinger, an American climber and owner of rival guiding company Alpenglow Expeditions. His own company guided climber Roxanne Vogel to the summit of Everest in just 14 days in 2019, where she used an \"altitude chamber\" at the gym and work to help her pre-acclimatise before the expedition.\nBut in the world of commercial guided mountaineering, where anti-doping rules don't apply, clients are largely unconcerned about the style of ascent. Some in the climbing community are simply curious to see how this will unfold.\n\"It would be great if this is true, and we could use xenon in the future to make the work of Sherpas safer,\" says Dawa Steven Sherpa, owner of Nepal-based guiding company Asia Trekking.\nAfter all, it won't be the first time humans have enlisted the help of drugs to survive on the tallest mountains \u2013 one of the harshest environments on Earth.\nAs climbers ascend to high altitude, they experience a drop in atmospheric pressure that reduces the amount of oxygen they inhale. This is because the number of air molecules in the atmosphere falls the higher you get. At 5,500m (18,045ft) \u2013 slightly above the Everest base camp \u2013 there is roughly only half as much oxygen available for us to breathe compared with at sea level. On the summit at 8,850m (29,035ft), this drops to one-third of the usual oxygen. The weather on any given day can also have an effect, leading to dramatic swings in atmospheric pressure to such an extent that it would be equivalent to climbing an additional 700m (2,297ft), according to one study.\nAll of this means that climbers are able to get less oxygen into their blood stream and into their bodies. Researchers who have studied blood oxygen levels of climbers on Everest have recorded some of the lowest levels ever seen in humans.\nIf exposed suddenly to these conditions, people can become severely hypoxic, a state that is normally only seen in critically ill patients being treated in hospitals or during serious incidents while under anaesthetic. From altitudes as low as 4,500m (14,764ft) \u2013 brain function starts to become impaired in ways that affect decision-making and problem-solving tasks.\nThe human body, however, is able to adapt to hypobaric hypoxia (hypoxia caused by low air pressure) and reacts with a range of different responses, explains Martin Burtscher, a long-time researcher in the field of high-altitude medicine and professor at University of Innsbruck in Austria. We start to hyperventilate and consequently exhale more carbon dioxide, which helps counteract oxygen desaturation. Kidney and bladder function also change to increase the concentration of blood cells, while an increase in heart rate drives more oxygen around the body, says Burtscher.\nErythropoiesis, a process that increases red blood cell production in response to the presence of EPO, is one of the most important adaptations. After weeks of acclimatisation, erythropoiesis increases total blood volume and oxygen transportation capacity.\nSometimes, however, these adaptive responses can fail.\n\"If hypoxia becomes too severe, acute mountain sickness or life-threatening pulmonary or brain oedema develop,\" says Burtscher.\nIn those cases, capillaries of the lung and the brain lose their ability to retain fluids, which leaks out between the cells into brain or lung tissue, explains Andrew Peacock. The consequence is loss of brain or lung function, both potentially fatal.\nIt is why most climbers on the world's highest mountains use supplementary oxygen, delivered from canisters through breathing apparatus, with a constant flow of the gas coming from high-pressure cylinders that mountaineers carry in their backpacks.\n\"It makes a huge difference,\" says Peacock. \"You are basically mimicking a lower altitude. It makes you less breathless, and it improves the function of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and muscles.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nBoth Hillary and Norgay used supplementary oxygen in 1953 and that approach continues today. Of 7,269 people known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest, only 230 have done it without the aid of supplemental oxygen.\nThere are some in the mountaineering community, however, who believe supplemental oxygen could also be considered as doping. It is a highly charged debate, balancing climber safety against ideals of a more \"pure\" style of mountaineering. The Piolet d'Or, the most prestigious annual award in mountaineering, tends to celebrate ascents achieved without supplemental oxygen, for example.\nEager to mitigate the effects of altitude further, some mountaineers and doctors have been willing to experiment with other remedies too, from existing prescription drugs to sketchy stimulants.\nIn 1953, the legendary Austrian alpinist Hermann Buhl achieved one the greatest feats in the history of mountaineering, summiting alone on the 8,126m (26,660ft) Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat. It remains the only time anyone has managed a \"solo\" first ascent of an 8,000m (26,247ft) peak. Buhl's feat is considered even more impressive as he did it without supplemental oxygen. During the gruesome descent, he was famously forced to spend the night at 7,900m (25,919ft), standing on a narrow ledge while leaning against a rock. At that time, Buhl was already known as a hard-core, pioneering alpinist. Still, it was unthinkable that somebody could survive this ordeal.\nAs he later described in his autobiography, he did, however, have a little help in his backpack in form of pervitin, methamphetamine pills that had been widely used by Nazi troops during World War Two.\nAnother stimulant, amphetamine, is often rumoured to be occasionally used by climbers on high-altitude mountain slopes. One study from 1993 analysed urine samples taken from 253 male mountaineers after a successful ascent to different mountains. Amphetamines traces were found in 7.1% of samples from those climbing above 3,300m (10,827ft).\nBy far the most popular prescription drug among mountaineers is acetazolamide, better known as Diamox. This carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, used in the treatment of many conditions, from glaucoma to epilepsy, also happens to be quite useful at high altitudes.\n\"It accelerates acclimatisation and improves sleep,\" says Burtscher.\nDexamethasone, a powerful corticosteroid, is still considered as the number one life-saving medicine for cerebral oedema and acute mountain sickness since it buys some time for the sick person to descend. Some research has indicated that dexamethasone could also be useful as a prophylactic treatment to stave off acute mountain sickness, although medical experts warn that it can result in potentially serious side effects and do not recommend it for this use.\nThere were hopes that sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, could also help to protect against high-altitude pulmonary oedema, but trials did not shown it to be effective.\nThe search for other drugs that can help give climbers a boost in performance and acclimatisation at high altitude never stopped. A team of doctors in Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao, for example, recently published details about a test of a drug normally used to treat anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Two climbers took the drug, which stimulates EPO production, as they ascended Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.\nBut even with all this help, Everest is a treacherous place and there is no guarantee of survival. Although there is little research on how long someone can remain at very high altitudes, experts agree that even with acclimatisation, the body will eventually start to deteriorate. Extremes of cold and wind exposure, the strain placed on the lungs and heart, deterioration of the tissues and organs, dehydration and weight loss all make spending any prolonged visit to the so called \"Death Zone\" \u2013 generally considered to be above 8,000m (26,247ft) \u2013 increasingly dangerous.\nSo, cutting down the time spent on the mountain is always beneficial.\nThis is where xenon could make a real difference, at least according to Michael Fries, head of the department of anaesthesiology at St Vincenz Krankenhaus Limburg in Germany, who came up with the idea and suggested it to Furtenbach. \u00a0\nXenon has been used in a wide range of products, from car headlights to ion propulsion engines and ballistic missiles. It could also serve as an anaesthetic, which is something Fries spent years researching while working at University Hospital Aachen in Germany.\n\"It is an almost ideal anaesthetic since it has a very rapid effect, quickly leaves the body and doesn't interact with other drugs,\" says Fries.\nUsing xenon for anaesthesia, however, proved to be challenging for multiple reasons. This extremely expensive gas must make up 70% of the anaesthetic mixture and it requires special equipment for administration.\nThen, in 2014, Fries and his colleagues heard claims that some Russian athletes had used xenon at the 2014 Winter Olympics to improve performance, so the group from University Hospital Aachen did their own study on 24 healthy volunteers. The results confirmed that a single inhalation of 30% xenon for 45 minutes significantly increased EPO level eight hours after exposure. According to Fries, the main effect of EPO production should be strongest within the first few days and last up to 14 days.\nCurious if this advantage could be used in the hypoxia-inducing world of high-altitude mountaineering, Fries contacted Furtenbach.\nPreviously, Furtenbach had managed to shorten the Everest expedition time to two weeks by using so-called hypoxic pre-acclimatisation. However, sleeping at home for eight weeks in tents with a lower percentage of oxygen or repeatedly breathing reduced amounts of air through a mask was never a strategy that found much favour among his clients.\nKeen to try the xenon idea, Furtenbach did a test run on Aconcagua, 6,961m (22,838ft) high mountain in Argentina. He received a low dose of xenon shortly before the expedition in 2020.\n\"I reached the summit within a week, without any prior acclimatisation. I felt strong and fast,\" says Furtenbach.\nHe claims his red blood cell count went up by 10% while measurements of his blood oxygen saturation on the summit showed it was 89%.\nIf true, academics say, this would be remarkable. \u00a0At sea level, normal blood oxygen saturation is between 96-100%. Measurements taken from nine climbers during an expedition to Everest in 1993 showed that blood oxygen saturation of climbers fell below 90% at around 4,700m (15,420ft), while at 8,000m (26,247ft) climbers had only 70% saturation without supplementary oxygen. Even with supplementary oxygen, this increased only to 80%. Measurements taken during a research expedition to Everest in 2007 showed an even starker reduction in blood oxygen saturation in four climbers at an altitude of 8,400m (27,559ft), measuring some of the lowest levels ever recorded in humans who are not already close to death.\n\"I'm quite sceptical,\" says Mike Grocott, professor of anaesthesia and critical care at University of Southampton who led the research team during the 2007 expedition and has summited Everest himself. \"Xenon has a number of biological mechanisms, including boosting EPO, but the effect on red blood cells and oxygen transport is questionable.\"\nIn 2022, Furtenbach and two fellow guides did another xenon test \u2013 this time on Everest. The results, he says, were the same as on Aconcagua, except this time the group prepared at home with hypoxic pre-acclimatisation, where their bodies were slowly introduced to lower levels of oxygen by sleeping in a hypoxic tent at home.\n\"In each of these cases, we could see the effects on the endurance and the physical abilities,\" says Fries, who was involved in analysing the data gathered during the tests. \"They all had high oxygen saturations without the long acclimatisation periods and increase in haemoglobin levels.\"\nBut he acknowledges there is still a lack of peer-reviewed scientific research on this and says he hopes to publish findings in the future.\nFries also refutes concerns that xenon, when administered in small doses, could reduce decision-making ability on the mountain. The UIAA medical committee, for example, warned that using an anaesthetic gas in an unmonitored setting could affect brain function, stating \"even slight sedation is detrimental in the potentially dangerous setting of high-altitude mountaineering\". Fries says that in small doses, xenon only results in a short period of dizziness immediately after administration. \u00a0\nThree medical experts the BBC contacted for this story \u2013 all veterans of high-altitude research \u2013 are not entirely convinced about the strategy as a way to summit the highest mountain on Earth. They argue there is insufficient scientific proof that xenon actually does enhance performance at high altitude.\nBurtschner and Grocott both point to a study which confirmed that xenon did increase EPO concentration, but failed to \"stimulate increases in plasma volume or erythropoiesis, leaving cardiorespiratory fitness and athletic performance unchanged\".\nXenon, Grocott says, would need to have an \"extraordinary\" effect to enable someone to climb to the summit in just one week. \"That would have to be a very dramatic change. And I haven't seen any data suggesting that's true.\"\nIn the meantime, Furtenbach is proceeding with the plan to send four clients up Everest with the help of xenon gas. All four are in good physical shape, he says. They will climb with guides and bottled oxygen. Once new fixed ropes are in place, all the team will need is seven days of good weather.\u00a0\nThe rest of the world, meanwhile, will be watching.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nVitor Pereira - I want to build something stronger with Wolves\nVitor Pereira walks up the stairs of a pub in Shropshire, sits and puts his pint down. \n\"I'm in a good mood today, the weather is good, more beer, please,\" jokes the Wolves head coach, who adds that he enjoys a pint of Stella.\nPereira is holding court at a round table upstairs in a country pub just outside Wolverhampton, five months into his reign at Molineux. \nThis is not some gimmick he has done before at other clubs. The relationship with media in other countries - Pereira has worked in Portugal, Brazil, Greece, Turkey, Saudi and China - is very different. \nBut if interviewing a Premier League manager in a pub sounds both highly unusual and also a throwback to the 1980s, the setting makes more sense given the 56-year-old's habit of celebrating wins by \"being with the people\".\n\"First the points, then the pints\" was a phrase coined by Pereira which has transferred to the stands, with the words now adorning a banner at Molineux. \nIt came as Wolves battled the drop, but a run of six straight wins, their best in the top flight for 55 years, has the club now safely mid-table in the Premier League. \nPereira has endeared himself to Wolves supporters, and the city, with his desire to understand them and the area. \nTrips to the local Wetherspoons near the train station after victories have become a fixture - with Molineux serenading him with 'We'll see you in 'Spoons' during Saturday's 3-0 win over Leicester.\n\"What do we do in Wolverhampton after a game? If I lose the game I stay home and drink my beer alone. If I win the game, I go with the supporters to celebrate,\"  Pereira tells BBC Sport.\n\"The connection with the people is stronger when we suffer together and, when you are in a situation where you are fighting for survival, you feel this connection.\n\"In the moments we are suffering, you feel we are suffering together. In the moments of celebration, you need to be with them.\n\"In Wolverhampton, where do you want me to go? I must go to a pub, because this is the culture and where people go.\n\"When I go to a pub it's not about the beer. Of course I like the beer but I go to be with the people, to feel that I'm doing something to make them happy, to make them proud.\n\"Work, home, then we go to a pub just for a beer or two beers and finish. This is our life.\"\nWolves have adopted Vitor Pereira's phrase after his success at Molineux \nThe down-to-earth philosophy comes from Pereira's upbringing.\nGrowing up on the coast in Espinho, 10 miles south of Porto, he recalls the harsh conditions he endured which have shaped him. \n\"It was a very humble village with fishermen and we grew up on the street,\" he said. \n\"Fighting together, fighting for the space. Competing and fighting. But this is what I have inside of me. This is the power.\n\"My house was 50 metres from the beach. At the time my father didn't have money so we lived in a 'basement'.\n\"The sea, in the winter, came strong, without barriers. Every winter, for three months, there was water inside. We had to rebuild the house. Every time there was water in the walls and a bad smell. I felt ashamed because my clothes smelled.\n\"You felt wet every time, that was our life.\n\"[Yet] I was a very happy teenager at the time because in this kind of community we have the confident guys together. When I look back, this power I feel inside of me came from this time.\"\nVisit all of BBC Sport's Wolves content\nHis playing career, Pereira readily admits, was underwhelming. He played as a midfielder for lesser-known Portuguese clubs Avanca, Oliveirense, Esmoriz, Estarreja, Fiaes and Sao Joao de Ver and retired at 28. \nYet it was enough to help put him through a sports course at the University of Porto, as he finished second in his class while completing his coaching qualifications. \n\"I had a career, it was in the third division in Portugal but I got the money to do my course, to go to the university, to buy my car, to buy my clothes,\" he said. \n\"Since I was 16 years-old, I never asked for one euro from my parents. After 16, small jobs, to get money, to go to the discos.\n\"On Saturdays, I was a lifeguard on the beach. They paid me a lot of money. I saw the sun and I saved people.\n\"I was 18 and 19 at that time - no worries. I went to the university. I did some small jobs to get some money and I started to save. I'm now 56. But my sons will spend the money, don't worry!\"\nHis three sons are all in their 20s and Pereira, who always felt being a coach was his calling, does not want - or expect - them to follow him into football. \n\"The sacrifices you have to make. I don't want this life for my sons,\" he says. \n\"They cannot have a family life in this job. It's impossible. We have a lot of moments where we suffer a lot and alone. I think we are always in a pre-depression.\n\"For me, the competition is like a drug. Passion and a drug. I cannot live without it because after one month I start to be nervous. I cannot enjoy nothing.\"\nPereira met BBC Sport and other journalists in a local pub for an on-record interview\n\"I want to recharge with their energy\" - Pereira celebrates with Wolves fans after beating Manchester United\nIt is clear Pereira misses his family, having travelled the globe since he started managing Padroense juniors in 2003. \nHe eventually became Porto assistant, to Andre Villas-Boas, and was in that role when they won the Europa League in 2011, replacing Villas-Boas when he moved to Chelsea.\nHis first game was against Pep Guardiola's Barcelona in the Super Cup, a 2-0 defeat,  but he won successive Primeira Liga titles before joining Al-Ahli and then Olympiacos, lifting the Greek Super League.\nSpells at 1860 Munich, Shanghai, Fenerbahce, Corinthians, Flamengo and Al Shabab followed before he joined Wolves, yet the intensity of management is not something which bothers him. \nHe said: \"I cannot speak about this because I don't want to cry, I have moments in my life. When I arrived in Brazil, I went to Corinthians. If you see the stadium of Corinthians and Flamengo, they have millions of supporters.\n\"When I met the press they ask me, 'Vitor, you don't feel the pressure?'. I'll tell you about the pressure. The pressure was when my father had cancer, my brother was dying, my mother was crying.\n\"When we deal with this, football is football. I don't feel any pressure, nothing. Zero. believe me.\"\nWolves go to Manchester City on Friday without pressure - after their 1-0 win at Manchester United in April that sealed survival with five games remaining.\nThere will be change in the summer after this season's brush with relegation. Matheus Cunha is expected to leave, with Manchester United interested, and the Brazil forward, who has scored 15 goals, has a \u00a362.5m release clause. \nPereira insists he cannot second-guess what will happen with Cunha, but that he will \"wish him the best\" either way. He says the 25-year-old has not directly told him he wants to leave, but is adamant he needs the power to shape the squad. \nMany will feel he has earned it. \nOnly champions Liverpool and Newcastle have won more games than Pereira's 10 in his 18 matches since he replaced Gary O'Neil in December - while Wolves have won more points than relegated trio of Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton combined in that same period.\nWolves were second bottom and five points adrift of the Foxes when he took over, they are now 23 ahead and 13th. Pereira will not need to buy another drink in Wolverhampton. \n\"Every time, I think I can do better and better and better because I just expressed half of myself,\" he adds. \n\"I have a lot to prove. If I'm in the right place to challenge me, I can do magic. Believe me.\"\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nEx-West Ham boss Lopetegui named Qatar manager",

The teachers' pay review body makes recommendations for England only but the NHS pay review body covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Public sector pay is set through a separate process in Scotland.\nThe recommendation of an above-inflation pay rise for teachers is likely to be because of ongoing concerns about staff recruitment and retention in schools.\nThese have been raised in previous pay recommendations. \nCalculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) show that, despite the 5.5% average cash pay rise teachers received in 2024-25, the average pay of most teachers in that year - when adjusted for inflation - was still lower than than it was back in 2010.\nIn the case of the most experienced teachers, pay was 9% lower than it was 15 years ago in real terms.\nOfficial government data also shows widening gaps between the recruitment figures for teachers in specific subjects and their recruitment targets.\nJust 17% of the target for secondary school physics teacher recruitment was achieved in 2023-24, down from 42% in 2019-20.\nOverall teacher recruitment was 62% of the target, down from 87% in 2019-20\nWe do not know what all the individual pay recommendations from the review bodies will be, but Verify has done some calculations that give a rough sense of the potential impact.\nOverall UK public sector pay in 2023-24 was \u00a3272bn, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nThe previous Conservative government had budgeted for a 2% cash increase in public sector pay in 2024-25.\nAnd last July, Labour said the cost of meeting the full 2024-25 pay recommendations would be an additional \u00a39.4bn.\nThat implies that total public sector pay in 2024-25 will have been roughly \u00a3287bn, which is around a fifth of total government spending.\nSo, if the total bill across the public sector for 2025-26 went up by another 3% - rather than 2.8% - that would imply the government needing to find about an extra \u00a3550m.\nBut if it went up by 4% it would imply the need to find around an extra \u00a33.5bn.\nThe government said in the 2024 Autumn Budget that it would seek to fund any pay rises above what departments have budgeted for not by raising taxes or more borrowing but by \"productivity improvements\".\nIn other words, departments would have to accommodate the additional pay rise by making cuts elsewhere in their budgets.\nThe government has reiterated this, with the prime minister's spokesperson telling reporters in December 2024 that: \"For pay awards to go beyond inflation they will have to be met by productivity improvements.\"\nThe National Education Union (NEU), England's largest teaching union, has already said it would resist any further effective cuts to the overall education budget.\nAnd it is demanding any pay rise for teachers be fully funded with new money.\nThe NEU said in April 2025 that it would vote on taking strike action if the government stuck with its 2.8% pay offer for the 2025-26 academic year.\nAnd when the government indicated in December 2024 that it could only afford a 2.8% pay rise in the health sector in England, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing both said the figure was too low.\nThe government funded last year's above inflation pay increase for public sector workers by increasing employers' National Insurance contributions and Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in November that she did not want to increase taxes again this Parliament.\nAs for borrowing, she has left herself only \u00a39.9bn of \"headroom\", or leeway, against hitting her chosen fiscal rules in 2029-30 and taking on additional debt to pay for higher public sector pay would risk being on course to breach her rules.\nBut analysts also warn that it will be far from easy to pay for higher pay through increased public sector productivity.\n\"If the pay recommendations come in higher than what departments have planned for, that will create a budgeting challenge,\" says Ben Zaranko of the IFS. \n\"If no additional funding is forthcoming, it will force ruthless prioritisation and tough choices elsewhere. Public service leaders are already being asked to find major efficiency savings, and there is a limit to what is realistic.\"\nAdditional reporting by Anthony Reuben\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

Calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) show that, despite the 5.5% average cash pay rise teachers received in 2024-25, the average pay of most teachers in that year - when adjusted for inflation - was still lower than than it was back in 2010.In the case of the most experienced teachers, pay was 9% lower than it was 15 years ago in real terms.Official government data also shows widening gaps between the recruitment figures for teachers in specific subjects and their recruitment targets.Just 17% of the target for secondary school physics teacher recruitment was achieved in 2023-24, down from 42% in 2019-20.Overall teacher recruitment was 62% of the target, down from 87% in 2019-20How much would it cost to meet these higher pay settlements?We do not know what all the individual pay recommendations from the review bodies will be, but Verify has done some calculations that give a rough sense of the potential impact.Overall UK public sector pay in 2023-24 was \u00a3272bn, according to the Office for National Statistics.The previous Conservative government had budgeted for a 2% cash increase in public sector pay in 2024-25.And last July, Labour said the cost of meeting the full 2024-25 pay recommendations would be an additional \u00a39.4bn.That implies that total public sector pay in 2024-25 will have been roughly \u00a3287bn, which is around a fifth of total government spending.So, if the total bill across the public sector for 2025-26 went up by another 3% - rather than 2.8% - that would imply the government needing to find about an extra \u00a3550m.But if it went up by 4% it would imply the need to find around an extra \u00a33.5bn.Where would the money come from?The government said in the 2024 Autumn Budget that it would seek to fund any pay rises above what departments have budgeted for not by raising taxes or more borrowing but by \"productivity improvements\".In other words, departments would have to accommodate the additional pay rise by making cuts elsewhere in their budgets.The government has reiterated this, with the prime minister's spokesperson telling reporters in December 2024 that: \"For pay awards to go beyond inflation they will have to be met by productivity improvements. \"What have the unions said?The National Education Union (NEU), England's largest teaching union, has already said it would resist any further effective cuts to the overall education budget.And it is demanding any pay rise for teachers be fully funded with new money.The NEU said in April 2025 that it would vote on taking strike action if the government stuck with its 2.8% pay offer for the 2025-26 academic year.And when the government indicated in December 2024 that it could only afford a 2.8% pay rise in the health sector in England, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing both said the figure was too low.Why does the government not fully fund the recommended pay rise?The government funded last year's above inflation pay increase for public sector workers by increasing employers' National Insurance contributions and Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in November that she did not want to increase taxes again this Parliament.As for borrowing, she has left herself only \u00a39.9bn of \"headroom\", or leeway, against hitting her chosen fiscal rules in 2029-30 and taking on additional debt to pay for higher public sector pay would risk being on course to breach her rules.But analysts also warn that it will be far from easy to pay for higher pay through increased public sector productivity. Public sector pay is set through a separate process in Scotland.No extra cash for higher pay deals, says Downing StreetWhy would the teachers' pay review body recommend 4%?The recommendation of an above-inflation pay rise for teachers is likely to be because of ongoing concerns about staff recruitment and retention in schools.These have been raised in previous pay recommendations. The teachers' pay review body makes recommendations for England only but the NHS pay review body covers England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",

        "article_text": "Early summer. A Test squad due to be announced. It takes me back to the times I was bowling for a place in the England team.\nI was an international cricketer between 2010 and 2017. At the beginning of each of those summers, there was a mix of optimism, hope and determination that I would bowl well enough in Championship cricket to get the call.\nWickets were the currency. James Anderson and Stuart Broad were inked in the side, so Tim Bresnan, Graham Onions, Chris Tremlett, Chris Woakes, myself and a number of others were competing for the other spot.\nThis bred competition and hunger, because I knew the other guys were trying to do exactly the same thing. Backing up performances and demonstrating the stamina to do it over a number of weeks in the domestic game was another aspect of showing you were hardened for the intensity of international cricket.\nIn recent years, under Rob Key, Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes, the way England select their teams has changed. I wonder if the feelings of the players hoping to be selected, those feelings I remember so well, have changed too.\nThere is still the opportunity for a player to prove himself the 'old school' way, even if it does feel like that is becoming a more difficult route into the England team.\nSam Cook has 318 first-class wickets to his name, at an average of just 19.77\nSam Cook has been the outstanding seam bowler in county cricket for the past number of years. At the age of 27, with 318 first-class wickets at an average of 19.77, it seems as though his time has finally come.\nAfter he was asked to rest from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire a couple of weeks ago, it would be surprising if he is not in the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe next month.\nEven with that overwhelming body of evidence and a stack of wickets behind him, I do feel like it is one performance that has convinced England Cook is finally worth backing.\nAt the beginning of last summer, when the pitches were flat and the Kookaburra ball was being used in the Championship, bowlers toiled. Cook took 10 wickets for Essex to lead them to victory over Nottinghamshire. It is the sort of display that will catch the eye of the selectors, who will rightly look for more than statistics when it comes to making their judgements.\nAnd that, perhaps, is the difference between what I felt I was going through more than a decade ago and what can earn selection at this moment. Now it is far more exciting.\nYes, Cook has an outstanding record, but he also needed that standout display to give Key and company a nudge. In an attack that only has room for one 'English' style seamer, an injury to Woakes has presented an opportunity. And it might actually be one outstanding performance for other England hopefuls that earns them a call-up.\nWood irritated by England's 'golf, golf, golf' narrative\nCook in line for Test call-up as England ask Essex to rest him\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nI see bowlers in the domestic game who have the raw materials to be international players. Sonny Baker and John Turner are two of them, both of Hampshire (although Turner has been on loan at Lancashire), and have been identified by England despite having almost no first-class cricket behind them.\nBaker, Turner and others who have the attributes to trouble the best batters will know that one performance, even one spell, might be enough to earn them a call-up. There's precedent for it, too. Stokes first saw off-spinner Shoaib Bashir bowl in a clip on social media, then shared it in his WhatsApp group with Key and McCullum. Not long after, Bashir was in the England squad.\nAnother difference between my time as an international cricketer and now is England's attitude towards franchise cricket, particularly the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nNow there is an acceptance players hold a lot of power and cannot be denied lucrative franchise opportunities. Who can blame the players for this? After all, it can be a short career. \nThis is in contrast to when I wanted to put my name forward for the 2013 IPL auction. I thought I had a good chance of being picked up. I was bowling quickly, had bowled nicely in a white-ball series in India, getting good players out, and had just had a good T20 World Cup.\nAt the end of 2012, we were on the famous Test tour of India, when we won 2-1. I had to ask permission from the England and Wales Cricket Board to enter the auction and, within five minutes of submitting my forms, received an email telling me I wasn't allowed but that Andy Flower, the head coach, would explain why.\nThat evening, I was having room service in the bedroom of Kevin Pietersen (who was the first England player to spot the might of the IPL), along with Eoin Morgan. I was summoned to see Flower and, as I was on the way out of the door, KP told me to tell Flower I was entering the auction whether he liked it or not.\nIt was a short meeting with Flower. He told me I had to be playing county cricket at the beginning of the following summer in order to back-up performances and be in contention to play Test cricket at the beginning of a double Ashes year. I did as I was told. To me, Test cricket was the pinnacle and I would have done anything to get a spot in that England team.\nTimes have changed. How exciting it must be to be a player now with the potential to succeed in international cricket.\nEvery time you walk on to the pitch you feel like you have the opportunity to put your name forward, to be the subject of the next clip in the England management WhatsApp group, with Key and his cohorts thinking 'we can't ignore this, can we?'",

        "article_text": "A commercial expedition is planning to take clients up the tallest mountain in the world in record time with the help of xenon gas. But some in the climbing and medical world worry whether the strategy is an unnecessary gamble.\nWhen Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary\u00a0made their first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953, it took more than two months of effort to reach the summit. In order to adjust to the extreme thin air at high altitude, the team spent several weeks acclimatising, working their way slowly upwards. After reaching Base Camp, they spent seven weeks making brief forays up and down the mountain to set ropes, lay ladders and establish ever higher camps before their assault on the summit. In short, they laid siege to the mountain.\nToday, the miles of fixed ropes put along the route by teams of Sherpas and the slick logistics perfected by commercial guiding companies allow hundreds of climbers to summit Everest every year. But the time it takes for most to climb Mount Everest hasn't changed dramatically since that first ascent.\nMany expeditions still recommend allowing around two months to reach the top with extensive acclimatisation, although this depends on a range of factors including the weather, traffic on the mountain and the fitness of the climber. It can take up to a week to trek to Base Camp, but once there most people need, on average, around 40 days to reach the summit. But some companies even offer fast-track expeditions that claim to get clients there in as little as two weeks.\nThis season, however, one guiding company has promised to slash the time even further by taking its clients to the top of the world in just one week, starting from an airport in London. They will fly to Kathmandu in Nepal, take a helicopter to Everest base camp and climb the mountain in only a few days. This way, they will skip the usual painstaking three weeks of acclimatisation in the mountains \u2013 all for around \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3127,000/$170,000) per person. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe offer, which raised more than a few eyebrows in the climbing community, came from Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach, who will rely on an unexpected new strategy \u2013 inhaling xenon, a noble gas that is sometimes used as an anaesthetic.\nThe logic behind the idea is relatively simple. Around 10 years ago, it became apparent that xenon has one interesting side effect \u2013 it increases production of a protein called erythropoietin. Known for short as EPO, erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that our kidneys produce as reaction to insufficient oxygen levels. EPO fights hypoxia \u2013 a condition that occurs when the body can't get enough oxygen \u2013 by increasing the number of red blood cells and the crucial protein they carry, haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body. At high altitudes, this process will naturally happen after multiple rounds of going up and down the mountain \u2013 acclimatisation in other words \u2013 to slowly adapt the body to lower oxygen levels.\nBut xenon, it is claimed, could potentially offer a shortcut. By inhaling carefully controlled doses of the gas shortly before the expedition, it may be possible to accelerate the effects of acclimatisation. Furtenbach says he successfully tested xenon himself on previous expeditions. There is, however, little published scientific evidence showing the strategy works. One recent systematic review of the scientific research, for example, found no conclusive evidence that inhaling xenon had a positive effect on the action of EPO in the human body.\n\"Increase in erythropoietin does nothing on its own,\" says Andrew Peacock, an honorary professor specialising in altitude medicine at the University of Glasgow in the UK. \"The question in this case is, does it really stimulate production of red blood cells in such a short period?\"\nFor Furtenbach, the main goal of this strategy is to allow climbers to summit faster and so reduce the risk of being caught in bad weather, avalanches or getting sick.\n\"The less time you spend on the mountain, the safer the expedition becomes,\" he says.\u00a0\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 How tall will Mount Everest get before it stops growing\n\u2022 Death in the clouds: The problem with Everest's bodies\n\u2022 Scientists in Antarctica began developing their own accent\nFurtenbach has a reputation for pushing the limits of what is possible on Everest. He has specialised in offering \"flash\" three-week expeditions, where mountaineers pre-acclimatise at home before making their trip. In the Everest climbing season of 2025, he is planning to use the xenon approach to help four British clients reach the summit in early May.\nMany in the mountaineering community, however, have reacted to his plans with a mix of scepticism and condemnation.\nThe medical commission at the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA) \u2013 the umbrella group for mountaineering organisations around the world \u2013 issued a cautionary statement after Furtenbach revealed his plans. It warned of the absence of clinical research or scientific proof about the safety and efficiency of using xenon at high altitudes. A previous assessment by the same body also warned that drugs designed to induce EPO could potentially increase the risk of blood clots capable of triggering strokes or pulmonary embolisms.\nSome climbers have also\u00a0pointed\u00a0out that substances that artificially increase the amount of EPO in the blood \u2013 including xenon \u2013 are\u00a0banned\u00a0by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) in competitive sport.\n\"Why would we use substances in mountaineering that are banned in all other sports,\" says Adrian Ballinger, an American climber and owner of rival guiding company Alpenglow Expeditions. His own company guided climber Roxanne Vogel to the summit of Everest in just 14 days in 2019, where she used an \"altitude chamber\" at the gym and work to help her pre-acclimatise before the expedition.\nBut in the world of commercial guided mountaineering, where anti-doping rules don't apply, clients are largely unconcerned about the style of ascent. Some in the climbing community are simply curious to see how this will unfold.\n\"It would be great if this is true, and we could use xenon in the future to make the work of Sherpas safer,\" says Dawa Steven Sherpa, owner of Nepal-based guiding company Asia Trekking.\nAfter all, it won't be the first time humans have enlisted the help of drugs to survive on the tallest mountains \u2013 one of the harshest environments on Earth.\nAs climbers ascend to high altitude, they experience a drop in atmospheric pressure that reduces the amount of oxygen they inhale. This is because the number of air molecules in the atmosphere falls the higher you get. At 5,500m (18,045ft) \u2013 slightly above the Everest base camp \u2013 there is roughly only half as much oxygen available for us to breathe compared with at sea level. On the summit at 8,850m (29,035ft), this drops to one-third of the usual oxygen. The weather on any given day can also have an effect, leading to dramatic swings in atmospheric pressure to such an extent that it would be equivalent to climbing an additional 700m (2,297ft), according to one study.\nAll of this means that climbers are able to get less oxygen into their blood stream and into their bodies. Researchers who have studied blood oxygen levels of climbers on Everest have recorded some of the lowest levels ever seen in humans.\nIf exposed suddenly to these conditions, people can become severely hypoxic, a state that is normally only seen in critically ill patients being treated in hospitals or during serious incidents while under anaesthetic. From altitudes as low as 4,500m (14,764ft) \u2013 brain function starts to become impaired in ways that affect decision-making and problem-solving tasks.\nThe human body, however, is able to adapt to hypobaric hypoxia (hypoxia caused by low air pressure) and reacts with a range of different responses, explains Martin Burtscher, a long-time researcher in the field of high-altitude medicine and professor at University of Innsbruck in Austria. We start to hyperventilate and consequently exhale more carbon dioxide, which helps counteract oxygen desaturation. Kidney and bladder function also change to increase the concentration of blood cells, while an increase in heart rate drives more oxygen around the body, says Burtscher.\nErythropoiesis, a process that increases red blood cell production in response to the presence of EPO, is one of the most important adaptations. After weeks of acclimatisation, erythropoiesis increases total blood volume and oxygen transportation capacity.\nSometimes, however, these adaptive responses can fail.\n\"If hypoxia becomes too severe, acute mountain sickness or life-threatening pulmonary or brain oedema develop,\" says Burtscher.\nIn those cases, capillaries of the lung and the brain lose their ability to retain fluids, which leaks out between the cells into brain or lung tissue, explains Andrew Peacock. The consequence is loss of brain or lung function, both potentially fatal.\nIt is why most climbers on the world's highest mountains use supplementary oxygen, delivered from canisters through breathing apparatus, with a constant flow of the gas coming from high-pressure cylinders that mountaineers carry in their backpacks.\n\"It makes a huge difference,\" says Peacock. \"You are basically mimicking a lower altitude. It makes you less breathless, and it improves the function of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and muscles.\" \u00a0\u00a0\nBoth Hillary and Norgay used supplementary oxygen in 1953 and that approach continues today. Of 7,269 people known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest, only 230 have done it without the aid of supplemental oxygen.\nThere are some in the mountaineering community, however, who believe supplemental oxygen could also be considered as doping. It is a highly charged debate, balancing climber safety against ideals of a more \"pure\" style of mountaineering. The Piolet d'Or, the most prestigious annual award in mountaineering, tends to celebrate ascents achieved without supplemental oxygen, for example.\nEager to mitigate the effects of altitude further, some mountaineers and doctors have been willing to experiment with other remedies too, from existing prescription drugs to sketchy stimulants.\nIn 1953, the legendary Austrian alpinist Hermann Buhl achieved one the greatest feats in the history of mountaineering, summiting alone on the 8,126m (26,660ft) Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat. It remains the only time anyone has managed a \"solo\" first ascent of an 8,000m (26,247ft) peak. Buhl's feat is considered even more impressive as he did it without supplemental oxygen. During the gruesome descent, he was famously forced to spend the night at 7,900m (25,919ft), standing on a narrow ledge while leaning against a rock. At that time, Buhl was already known as a hard-core, pioneering alpinist. Still, it was unthinkable that somebody could survive this ordeal.\nAs he later described in his autobiography, he did, however, have a little help in his backpack in form of pervitin, methamphetamine pills that had been widely used by Nazi troops during World War Two.\nAnother stimulant, amphetamine, is often rumoured to be occasionally used by climbers on high-altitude mountain slopes. One study from 1993 analysed urine samples taken from 253 male mountaineers after a successful ascent to different mountains. Amphetamines traces were found in 7.1% of samples from those climbing above 3,300m (10,827ft).\nBy far the most popular prescription drug among mountaineers is acetazolamide, better known as Diamox. This carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, used in the treatment of many conditions, from glaucoma to epilepsy, also happens to be quite useful at high altitudes.\n\"It accelerates acclimatisation and improves sleep,\" says Burtscher.\nDexamethasone, a powerful corticosteroid, is still considered as the number one life-saving medicine for cerebral oedema and acute mountain sickness since it buys some time for the sick person to descend. Some research has indicated that dexamethasone could also be useful as a prophylactic treatment to stave off acute mountain sickness, although medical experts warn that it can result in potentially serious side effects and do not recommend it for this use.\nThere were hopes that sildenafil, commonly known as Viagra, could also help to protect against high-altitude pulmonary oedema, but trials did not shown it to be effective.\nThe search for other drugs that can help give climbers a boost in performance and acclimatisation at high altitude never stopped. A team of doctors in Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao, for example, recently published details about a test of a drug normally used to treat anaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Two climbers took the drug, which stimulates EPO production, as they ascended Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.\nBut even with all this help, Everest is a treacherous place and there is no guarantee of survival. Although there is little research on how long someone can remain at very high altitudes, experts agree that even with acclimatisation, the body will eventually start to deteriorate. Extremes of cold and wind exposure, the strain placed on the lungs and heart, deterioration of the tissues and organs, dehydration and weight loss all make spending any prolonged visit to the so called \"Death Zone\" \u2013 generally considered to be above 8,000m (26,247ft) \u2013 increasingly dangerous.\nSo, cutting down the time spent on the mountain is always beneficial.\nThis is where xenon could make a real difference, at least according to Michael Fries, head of the department of anaesthesiology at St Vincenz Krankenhaus Limburg in Germany, who came up with the idea and suggested it to Furtenbach. \u00a0\nXenon has been used in a wide range of products, from car headlights to ion propulsion engines and ballistic missiles. It could also serve as an anaesthetic, which is something Fries spent years researching while working at University Hospital Aachen in Germany.\n\"It is an almost ideal anaesthetic since it has a very rapid effect, quickly leaves the body and doesn't interact with other drugs,\" says Fries.\nUsing xenon for anaesthesia, however, proved to be challenging for multiple reasons. This extremely expensive gas must make up 70% of the anaesthetic mixture and it requires special equipment for administration.\nThen, in 2014, Fries and his colleagues heard claims that some Russian athletes had used xenon at the 2014 Winter Olympics to improve performance, so the group from University Hospital Aachen did their own study on 24 healthy volunteers. The results confirmed that a single inhalation of 30% xenon for 45 minutes significantly increased EPO level eight hours after exposure. According to Fries, the main effect of EPO production should be strongest within the first few days and last up to 14 days.\nCurious if this advantage could be used in the hypoxia-inducing world of high-altitude mountaineering, Fries contacted Furtenbach.\nPreviously, Furtenbach had managed to shorten the Everest expedition time to two weeks by using so-called hypoxic pre-acclimatisation. However, sleeping at home for eight weeks in tents with a lower percentage of oxygen or repeatedly breathing reduced amounts of air through a mask was never a strategy that found much favour among his clients.\nKeen to try the xenon idea, Furtenbach did a test run on Aconcagua, 6,961m (22,838ft) high mountain in Argentina. He received a low dose of xenon shortly before the expedition in 2020.\n\"I reached the summit within a week, without any prior acclimatisation. I felt strong and fast,\" says Furtenbach.\nHe claims his red blood cell count went up by 10% while measurements of his blood oxygen saturation on the summit showed it was 89%.\nIf true, academics say, this would be remarkable. \u00a0At sea level, normal blood oxygen saturation is between 96-100%. Measurements taken from nine climbers during an expedition to Everest in 1993 showed that blood oxygen saturation of climbers fell below 90% at around 4,700m (15,420ft), while at 8,000m (26,247ft) climbers had only 70% saturation without supplementary oxygen. Even with supplementary oxygen, this increased only to 80%. Measurements taken during a research expedition to Everest in 2007 showed an even starker reduction in blood oxygen saturation in four climbers at an altitude of 8,400m (27,559ft), measuring some of the lowest levels ever recorded in humans who are not already close to death.\n\"I'm quite sceptical,\" says Mike Grocott, professor of anaesthesia and critical care at University of Southampton who led the research team during the 2007 expedition and has summited Everest himself. \"Xenon has a number of biological mechanisms, including boosting EPO, but the effect on red blood cells and oxygen transport is questionable.\"\nIn 2022, Furtenbach and two fellow guides did another xenon test \u2013 this time on Everest. The results, he says, were the same as on Aconcagua, except this time the group prepared at home with hypoxic pre-acclimatisation, where their bodies were slowly introduced to lower levels of oxygen by sleeping in a hypoxic tent at home.\n\"In each of these cases, we could see the effects on the endurance and the physical abilities,\" says Fries, who was involved in analysing the data gathered during the tests. \"They all had high oxygen saturations without the long acclimatisation periods and increase in haemoglobin levels.\"\nBut he acknowledges there is still a lack of peer-reviewed scientific research on this and says he hopes to publish findings in the future.\nFries also refutes concerns that xenon, when administered in small doses, could reduce decision-making ability on the mountain. The UIAA medical committee, for example, warned that using an anaesthetic gas in an unmonitored setting could affect brain function, stating \"even slight sedation is detrimental in the potentially dangerous setting of high-altitude mountaineering\". Fries says that in small doses, xenon only results in a short period of dizziness immediately after administration. \u00a0\nThree medical experts the BBC contacted for this story \u2013 all veterans of high-altitude research \u2013 are not entirely convinced about the strategy as a way to summit the highest mountain on Earth. They argue there is insufficient scientific proof that xenon actually does enhance performance at high altitude.\nBurtschner and Grocott both point to a study which confirmed that xenon did increase EPO concentration, but failed to \"stimulate increases in plasma volume or erythropoiesis, leaving cardiorespiratory fitness and athletic performance unchanged\".\nXenon, Grocott says, would need to have an \"extraordinary\" effect to enable someone to climb to the summit in just one week. \"That would have to be a very dramatic change. And I haven't seen any data suggesting that's true.\"\nIn the meantime, Furtenbach is proceeding with the plan to send four clients up Everest with the help of xenon gas. All four are in good physical shape, he says. They will climb with guides and bottled oxygen. Once new fixed ropes are in place, all the team will need is seven days of good weather.\u00a0\nThe rest of the world, meanwhile, will be watching.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "At least 68 African migrants have been killed in a US air strike on a detention centre in Houthi-controlled north-western Yemen, the armed group's TV channel says.\nAl Masirah reported that another 47 migrants were injured, most of them critically, when the centre in Saada province was bombed. It posted graphic footage showing multiple bodies covered in the rubble of a destroyed building.\nA US defence official said the US military's Central Command was aware of the claims of civilian casualties.\nThe strike came hours after Central Command announced its forces had hit more than 800 targets since President Donald Trump ordered an intensification of the air campaign against the Houthis on 15 March.\nIt said the strikes had \"killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders\", including senior officials overseeing missile and drone programmes.\nHouthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.\nThe migrant detention centre in Saada was reportedly holding 115 Africans when it was hit four times shortly before 05:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Monday, according to Al Masirah.\nThe casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but Al Masirah's videos showed first responders recovering the bodies of at least a dozen men among pieces of concrete and metal debris on the floor of a large building with partially destroyed walls and no roof.\nAt a local hospital, another injured man told Al Masirah: \"The strike hit us while we were sleeping, that's it.\"\nFollowing a visit to the scene, the chairman of the Somali community in Yemen,  Ibrahim Cabdulqaadir Macallin, told the BBC: \"It was tragic and horrific... I saw burnt people. We couldn't recognise some of the bodies we saw.\"\nHe said the number of Somali migrants who were killed was \"very small\" because a group had been removed from the detention centre three days earlier, and that the majority of the detainees were Ethiopians.\nHe also said that the facility was in an \"open area\" and \"not near any military base\".\nThe Houthi-run interior ministry condemned what it called the \"deliberate bombing\" of the facility and said it constituted a \"war crime\".\nThe US defence official said Central Command took the claims of civilian casualties very seriously, and that it was currently conducting a battle-damage assessment and inquiry into them.\nThe UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was \"deeply saddened by the reports of the tragic loss of life in Saada\".\n\"While IOM has not been operating at this facility, we remain committed to closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to offer support as needed,\" it added.\n\"We call on all parties to the conflict to prioritize the protection of civilians and ensure full respect for international laws.\"\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said teams from the Yemen Red Crescent Society provided lifesaving support by evacuating the wounded to hospitals and were ensuring a dignified management of the dead. \nIn 2022, at least 66 people were reportedly killed when the Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen's government struck a pre-trial detention facility only 100m (330ft) away from the location of Monday's attack.\nAl Masirah also reported that another eight people had been killed in overnight US air strikes in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa.\nThe statement put out by Centcom late on Sunday said the US had \"intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations\" in order to \"preserve operational security\".\nDespite the devastation and humanitarian crisis in Yemen caused by 11 years of conflict, migrants continue to arrive in the country by boat from the Horn of Africa, motivated by political and economic instability, droughts and other extreme weather events in their own countries.\nMost of them are intending to cross into neighbouring Saudi Arabia to find work. Instead, they face exploitation, detention, violence, and dangerous journeys through active conflict zones, according to the IOM.\nIn 2024 alone, it says, almost 60,900 migrants arrived in the country, often with no means to survive. The majority of them are Ethiopians and Somalis.\nThousands of migrants are thought to be held in detention centres like the one in Saada, but there are no official statistics from the Houthi-run authorities. Rights groups say detainees experience dire conditions, including overcrowding, abuse and poor sanitation.\nEarlier this month, the Houthi-run government said a series of US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others. It said the terminal was a civilian facility and that the strikes constituted a \"war crime\".\nCentcom said the attack destroyed the ability of Ras Isa to accept fuel and that it would \"begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities\".\nLast month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be \"completely annihilated\". He also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.\nOn Sunday, Centcom said it would \"continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region\".\nOn Monday evening, the Houthis' military spokesman said its forces had retaliated for the US \"aggression and massacres against civilians\" by targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier battle group with \"a number of cruise and ballistic missiles and drones\".\nHe also said the group had launched a drone towards the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israel's military announced earlier that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nThe Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nThe Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.\nAfter taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.\nYemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated in 2015 when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.\nThe fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid.",

It posted graphic footage showing multiple bodies covered in the rubble of a destroyed building.A US defence official said the US military's Central Command was aware of the claims of civilian casualties.The strike came hours after Central Command announced its forces had hit more than 800 targets since President Donald Trump ordered an intensification of the air campaign against the Houthis on 15 March.It said the strikes had \"killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders\", including senior officials overseeing missile and drone programmes.Houthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.Who are the Houthis and why is the US targeting them?Hundreds of migrants killed by Saudi border guards - report'We make it or we die'The migrant detention centre in Saada was reportedly holding 115 Africans when it was hit four times shortly before 05:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Monday, according to Al Masirah.The casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but Al Masirah's videos showed first responders recovering the bodies of at least a dozen men among pieces of concrete and metal debris on the floor of a large building with partially destroyed walls and no roof.At a local hospital, another injured man told Al Masirah: \"The strike hit us while we were sleeping, that's it. ReutersThe Houthi-run interior ministry said the strike amounted to a \"war crime\"In 2022, at least 66 people were reportedly killed when the Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen's government struck a pre-trial detention facility only 100m (330ft) away from the location of Monday's attack.Al Masirah also reported that another eight people had been killed in overnight US air strikes in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa.The statement put out by Centcom late on Sunday said the US had \"intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations\" in order to \"preserve operational security\".Despite the devastation and humanitarian crisis in Yemen caused by 11 years of conflict, migrants continue to arrive in the country by boat from the Horn of Africa, motivated by political and economic instability, droughts and other extreme weather events in their own countries.Most of them are intending to cross into neighbouring Saudi Arabia to find work. Dozens of African migrants killed in US strike on Yemen, Houthis say9 hours agoShareSaveDavid Gritten & Jaroslav LukivBBC NewsShareSaveReutersHouthi-run media say the detention centre in Saada was holding African migrantsAt least 68 African migrants have been killed in a US air strike on a detention centre in Houthi-controlled north-western Yemen, the armed group's TV channel says.Al Masirah reported that another 47 migrants were injured, most of them critically, when the centre in Saada province was bombed. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.The Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.After taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.Yemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated in 2015 when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid.Middle EastYemenHouthis United States",

Already one of the best players in the world - and before he even turns 18.\nA picture that says it all - Getty photographer Michael Regan captured this image of Yamal\n\n\"I don't think I have seen a 45 minutes like that from one individual before in my life. It is unbelievable,\" said TNT Sports pundit Ally McCoist as the players walked off the pitch at half-time.\nInter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi gave Yamal the highest of praise afterwards.\n\"Lamine is the kind of talent that comes along every 50 years, and to see him up close really impressed me,\" he said.\n\"He caused us huge problems because we were supposed to double up on him and it wasn't enough.\"\nBarca boss Hansi Flick said: \"He's special, he's a genius. In the big matches, he shows up.\n\"If it only comes every 50 years like Simone said, I'm glad it's for Barcelona.\"\nBBC pundit Stephen Warnock called him \"a future Ballon d'Or winner\".\nOne of the games of the season has everyone excited about the second leg at the San Siro in Milan next week, a change of pace from Paris St-Germain's hard-fought 1-0 win at Arsenal the day before. \n'A very, very special player' - Yamal, 16, makes Euros history\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nThis video can not be played\nLamine Yamal - The Boy King\nThere was a bit of drama before the game when Yamal appeared to hurt his groin and went down the tunnel during the warm-up, with speculation that he might not play.\nHe did start but had barely had an impact before Inter led 2-0 via two fantastic goals - Marcus Thuram's 30-second backheel flick from a Dumfries cross, and Dutchman Dumfries' flying close-range volley.\nBut then Yamal - who was being double marked - came to life, beating a few Inter players before whipping the ball in off the far post with astonishing ease and confidence.\nMoments later, he beat more defenders on the byeline and slammed in a shot which Inter keeper Yann Sommer tipped on to the bar.\nFerran Torres then capped off a fine team move to get Barca level before the break.\nDumfries, though, got his second with a header to put the Italian side back in front.\nBut moments later Barca were level again as Yamal cleverly dummied a pass and Raphinha lashed a shot in from 25 yards which hit the bar and went in off the back of Sommer for an own goal.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan thought he had made it 4-3 to Inter but his goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.\nYet Yamal almost had the final say, one more memorable moment, when his cross-shot hit the angle of post and bar.\nThis video can not be played\nWarnock on Yamal's 'outrageous' performance against Inter\nIt is tough to even fathom how much Yamal has achieved at his age.\nThis was his 100th Barcelona appearance, and a 22nd goal to go with four in 19 games for Spain.\nYamal has 27 assists too, including two in Saturday's Copa del Rey final extra-time win over Real Madrid.\nMessi and Ronaldo did not make their international debuts until they were 18, while Yamal won Euro 2024 the day after his 17th birthday.\nMessi scored one goal and had no assists before he was 18, with Ronaldo bagging five and four assists.\nYamal is Barcelona's youngest La Liga player (aged 15) and the youngest to score and assist in La Liga for any team.\nHe also holds records for being the youngest Champions League starter, youngest player to score in a knockout game, a quarter-final and now a semi-final.\nYamal is Spain's youngest player and goalscorer and the youngest player and goalscorer in a European Championship.\n'Superstar' Yamal makes more history with Euros triumph\nThis video can not be played\nYamal is a genius, he is special - Flick\nVery few players have had the impact in football by Yamal's age. He will turn 18 in July.\nHe appears to be the closest thing we have seen to Barcelona and Argentina great Messi, now at Inter Miami and arguably the greatest footballer in history.\nThe pair both came through the Barca academy, La Masia, and both play on the right wing.\n\"I don't compare myself to him, because I don't compare myself to anyone - and much less with Messi,\" Yamal told reporters in the build-up to the game, while also describing the Argentine as \"the best player in history\".\nBut Messi was just very, very promising at the age of 17, rather than already regarded as one of the world's best.\nYamal added: \"I don't think the comparison makes sense, with Messi even less - I'm going to enjoy myself, and be myself.\" \nBut he has an unusual bit of history with Messi, who he was photographed with as a baby.\nA photo emerged, external from a charity calendar photoshoot taken at Barcelona's Nou Camp in 2007.\nIn it, a 20-year-old Messi held baby Yamal and helped him have a bath. Yes really.\nThe shoot came about after Unicef did a raffle in the town of Mataro where Lamine's family lived.\n\"We walked down to the city centre and you could tell there is a superstar in this town now in Lamine Yamal,\" said ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand on TNT Sports.\n\"There was a void when Messi left, this kid is doing stuff at 17 we have never seen before. The comfort and ease he plays with is remarkable and he is as at ease off the field.\"\nI don't compare myself to Messi - Barca star Yamal\nThis video can not be played\nHow putting faith in youth revitalised Barcelona\nPundits were in awe at what they saw from Yamal.\nOwen Hargreaves, the former Bayern Munich, Manchester United and England midfielder, called him a \"cheat code\" on TNT.\n\"I just want to see Lamine Yamal get the ball and everybody else get out of the way,\" he added.\nFormer Liverpool and England defender Warnock, watching for BBC's Champions League Match of the Day, said: \"He was unplayable at times. His goal was outrageous.\n\"It's ridiculous watching Yamal. You know, effectively, what he always wants to do \u2013 he wants to come inside on his left foot. So you over-compensate and he has got the ability to drag it with his left foot on to his right foot, and he can actually put a decent ball in with his right foot too.\n\"He is just a phenomenal talent and I love watching him.\"\nAnd Ferdinand wrote on social media: \"As a pure football talent I'm going as far as to say I think Lamine Yamal is on another level to any player playing the game in the top five leagues in world football.

I love being outside, the breadth of phenomenal people you meet [who] you wouldn't come across in everyday life,\" the 42-year-old, who lives near Guildford in Surrey, told BBC Sport.\n\"And really kind of pushing my body to the limits in a new way.\"\nImmediately hooked, Power devoted her time to training and travelling to compete in stage races around world.\nShortly after the birth of her second child, Cormac, she was faced with a dilemma.\nPower juggles her campaigning and ultrarunning alongside bringing up her three children\nHaving given up her entry to the iconic Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB) race while she recovered from the birth of her first child, Donnacha, three years before, she was not prepared to do so again.\nLike many races, UTMB had no pregnancy deferral policy at the time.\nDespite not being able to run so soon postpartum, Power entered the 106-mile event with a view to starting and maybe walking the first 10km.\nYet 43.5 hours after setting off she completed the challenge, that included 10,000m of climbing, inside the cut-off time, walking the whole way except for a short stretch after one of the highest points when she was worried she might get hypothermia. She crossed the line with then three-year-old Donnacha.\nThat moment is one she looks back on with immense pride, though it was a photograph of her taken with her younger son that day that would inspire what followed.\nFrench photographer Alexis Berg was at UTMB photographing the 2018 race, as he is at many ultra events. And it was at one of the refuelling stations that he saw something he had never previously seen at one of these events.\n\"I knew it was unusual. At that moment it was impossible to realise the photo would have such an impact, but I just pushed one button that day and everything else that has happened is because of Sophie,\" he said.\nWhat he captured was Power sitting down and breastfeeding her baby son during a break from the race.\n\"That photo has undoubtedly changed the course of my life. I worked out I should never have been on that start line,\" she said.\n\"I should have been given the opportunity to complete that kind of dream race when I was fit and healthy, not three months postpartum, trying to go 106 miles around a huge mountain by breastfeeding my baby. It was crazy.\"\nAlexis Berg's photograph of Power breast-feeding her three-month-old son, Cormac, at UTMB went viral in 2018\nPower wanted to ensure returning mums did not face the same choice and put their bodies through the same risk as she had done.\nShe founded the charity SheRaces with the core aim of breaking down barriers preventing women from entering events alongside men and safeguarding returning mothers.\nAfter the photo went viral, many male directors contacted her almost immediately to say they had added pregnancy deferrals to their programmes and expressed embarrassment that it was something they had not thought of before.\nShe engaged with more than 2,000 women to find out what prevented them from getting on the start line of races alongside men.\nHer research went far beyond elite level sport. Power is not a professional athlete herself and her real passion is for other women and girls who had been like her.\n\"Girls drop out of sport at such a high rate. There's a massive dream deficit for girls compared to boys,\" she said.\nPower believes a big reason for this is the language used when promoting sports and sporting events.\n\"It's 'hardest, toughest, baddest', and for a lot of women that's quite off-putting,\" she said.\n\"How do we redesign sport in a female lens? Can we make sure that the opportunities for girls are tailored to them, and what they want and sports provided in the right places in the right way?\"\nThe result of her research was a set of nine principles that organisers could commit to in order to make their events more inclusive for women.\nThese included adapting the use of language and imagery on websites to reflect and appeal to female runners, changing cut-off times, providing female toilets, period products, changing facilities and event T-shirts made specifically for female entrants, rather than unisex ones for all, and a safeguarding and harassment policy.\nCriteria for elite races includes equal exposure for the female race on social media coverage and prizes for female competition.\nPower has seen change in some of the world's biggest races.\nUTMB's policy, external since 2023 for some of its marquee events entitles those who are pregnant, have a pregnant partner or are adopting or birthing via surrogacy to a full refund and priority re-entry for up to five years.\nBut she says there is still a long way to go.\nAssefa sets women's record as Sawe wins men's race\nLondon Marathon breaks world record for most finishers\n'Finish lines not finish times' at London Marathon\nThe London Marathon had a world record number of finishers in 2025, surpassing the previous record of 55,646 set by the New York Marathon in November\nThe New York, Boston and London marathons now all have pregnancy deferrals in place, yet mothers must pay the entrance fee for a second time when they use the deferral scheme, she said.\nHer organisation's criteria requests races to implement a two-year deferral to allow people enough time to recover fully from their pregnancies.\n\"The majority of races are commercial, it's a business. If they can get more people on their start lines then they're going to do it and the purpose of the guidelines is they're almost non-cost. It's a no-brainer,\" she said.\n\"There are a lot of brands out there who say they are pro-women, yet they're sponsoring women's races that don't have pregnancy deferrals, that don't treat women equally.\n\"And then there are dinosaurs, they don't value the voice of female athletes.\n\"Then there are races that still need to make improvements, I put London Marathon in that bracket. They have listened to us, they are phenomenally inclusive, they've got loads of initiatives that they put out for diversity on their start lines, but they still want to make women pay twice for their place when they have a baby.\n\"I've definitely lost faith in some race organisers because of it but so many are changing and becoming better. You always feel like you fail at the battles you don't win but we're winning so many battles and driving so much change.\"\nThe London Marathon's policy, external allows entrants to defer for up to three years after giving birth. The event's organisers did not respond when asked why users of the deferral system must pay their entrance fee again.\nWhat is Couch to 5k and how do I start?\nPower suffered from hallucinations while on a world record-breaking ultramarathon across Ireland\nAs the scale of her work and its influence has grown, Power's propensity for testing her physical limits has grown with it.\nShe is now the holder of two Guinness world records - becoming the fastest woman to run the length of Ireland, last year.\nPower completed the gruelling 340-mile route in three days 12 hours and eight minutes, smashing the previous record set by Mimi Anderson by more than three hours.\nThe route took her through Munster, where husband John was born, and to County Cork, where many of the Power family live, running through torrential rainfall, experiencing the early stages of sun stroke and sleeping for little more than two hours, while sustaining herself on a diet of jam-filled tortilla wraps, gels, chews and ice cream.\nHer tongue was burned after two days of eating nothing but fruit and sweets. She pushed herself to the brink of total exhaustion.\n\"I was seeing nativity and Christmas scenes everywhere in this town. And all the trees had turned into plastic. The hallucinations were phenomenal, crazy,\" she said.\nShe has since gone on to set a second world record for the longest distance covered on a treadmill by a female in 48 hours and will be hosting her own women-only ultra races in the Peak District in August.\nSo how will she know when she has achieved what she set out to do?\n\"My ultimate goal for SheRaces is that we don't exist because it's not needed anymore and every woman is able to get on the start line,\" she added.\n\"Part of the reason I created it was to have something that wasn't just me and was owned by all women. We can all help each other and demand fairness.\"\nPower completed the 84-hour Ireland challenge with just short 20-minute naps on the roadside ",

We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.\nHe said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".\nThe antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.\n\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.\n\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.\nThe 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.\nIt is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.\nCurrently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.\n\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \n\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" \nOn the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. \nThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"\nDespite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch. \n\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.\nAirbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.\nL3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.\nThe team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.\nThese annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.\n\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. \nAnother advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.\nIt is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.\n\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".\nThey store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.\nBut with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.\nOn Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.\nIt is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.\nThe rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.\nThe satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.\n\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.\nHe said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".\nThe antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.\n\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.\n\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.\nThe 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.\nIt is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.\nCurrently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.\n\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \n\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" \nOn the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. \nThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"\nDespite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch. \n\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.\nAirbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.\nL3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.\nThe team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.\nThese annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.\n\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. \nAnother advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.\nIt is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.\n\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

When added to her existing relationship with head coach Charlotte Edwards, who herself said she wanted a three-format regular in charge, there was only one candidate.\nThere will be concerns about adding extra responsibility to such a vital player, but there were similar worries when Ben Stokes was made men's captain, and that has proved a masterstroke.\nPerhaps a greater worry is how well leadership will sit with Sciver-Brunt, who took a break from cricket in 2022 to focus on her mental health after standing in as captain for the Commonwealth Games.\nThis is where Edwards will come in. It seems likely that the new coach will do a lot of heavy lifting in terms of leadership, tactics and team culture, while Sciver-Brunt will set the example on the field. Their personalities should complement each other nicely.\nIf the appointment of Sciver-Brunt held little mystery, then the squad for the series against West Indies next month should provide more intrigue, especially with England due to appoint a national selector for the first time.\nEdwards, so knowledgeable when it comes to the domestic game here and abroad, will have her own ideas, while those close to the England team have privately spoken about the need for personnel change.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

He is likely to be joined in the squad by Matthew Potts (10 caps), Josh Tongue (two) and uncapped Essex man Sam Cook.\nA combination in the XI of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook would have 13 caps between them. Not since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago has England's pace attack looked so callow at home, when Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Richard Johnson had a combined seven caps.\nIndeed, England have played only one home Test without any of Woakes, Anderson or Stuart Broad in the past 18 years.\nAlthough Zimbabwe are improving \u2013 they have just earned a creditable 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh \u2013 England will be overwhelming favourites to win the four-day Test when it begins on 22 May.\nFollowing that, the five-match series at home to India and the Ashes away in Australia this winter will shape the leadership legacies of Stokes, coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.\n'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nWe've said naive things, but we do care - Wood\nWoakes has not played yet this season because of an ankle problem, while Wood is out until July following knee surgery.\nBrydon Carse remains sidelined with a foot problem and Olly Stone will not play before the back end of the summer after his own knee operation. Ollie Robinson, who has won 20 Test caps, has not played for England in more than a year and lost his central contract in October.\nAll-rounder Stokes, with 210 Test wickets, has more scalps than any other active England bowler, though his bowling is likely to be restricted. An injury sustained in the third Test against New Zealand in December was the second time in five months the talismanic captain had hurt his left hamstring.\nStokes will look to build his bowling in the run-up to the India series, when England will hope to have Woakes and Carse available. Jofra Archer could play his first red-ball game in four years for England Lions against India A in June. Speaking on Wednesday, Wood did not rule out a return for the conclusion of the India series.\nFor now, Atkinson will lead the attack following his stunning debut year in Test cricket while Potts played in England's last Test in New Zealand.\nTongue has not played for England for two years because of injuries but has enjoyed a superb start to the season with Nottinghamshire.\nCook, 27, has been the outstanding bowler in domestic cricket for some time, grabbing 318 first-class wickets at an average under 20.\nHe is not blessed with high pace and has had to wait for his chance, yet an indication an England call-up was on the horizon came when it was requested he be rested from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire last month.\nIf England feel they want further pace cover in the squad, it could come from 20-year-old left-armer Josh Hull, who made his Test debut last summer, or Hampshire's exciting prospect Sonny Baker. Baker has played only three first-class matches but was given an England development contract in February.\nOther areas of selection look more straightforward. Jamie Smith will return behind the stumps after missing the tour of New Zealand on paternity leave, while there is no suggestion Shoaib Bashir's place as the number one spinner is under threat.\nAny decisions over the top five will be delayed by Jacob Bethell's stint at the Indian Premier League.

We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.\nHe said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".\nThe antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.\n\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.\n\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.\nThe 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.\nIt is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.\nCurrently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.\n\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics. \n\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\" \nOn the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back. \nThe satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"\nDespite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch. \n\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.\nAirbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.\nL3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.\nThe team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.\nThese annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.\n\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney. \nAnother advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.\nIt is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.\n\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\" \nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander.\n\"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\"\nTo lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water,  \nThe scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\".  \nEvery animal was tagged with a radio tracking device. \n\"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\"\nThe monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained. \nSomewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically. \nBut in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover. \n\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people. \n\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\"",

You can probably guess what he is like...\"\nA lot of people have been asking. Because a lot of people have been watching.\nIt is not just what Pollock has done in the past 12 months - winning the Under-20 World Cup, scoring two tries on his senior England debut, being nominated for the Champions Cup player of the year, preparing to line up against Leinster in Saturday's semi-final and butting into the Lions selection conversation.\nIt is the way he has done it.\nThe 20-year-old back row has swagger and self-possession, and a side order of skulduggery.\nThere has been no dutiful trade-learning and spur-earning.\nInstead, just prodigious talent, Tigger-ish energy, galloping pace and a presumption that the world is his for the taking.\nIt gets people talking. And has done for a while.\nEighteen months ago a video circulated among Bedford's players.\nThey had been told that Pollock, then only 18, was joining them in the Championship on loan.\n\"He came with a little bit of a reputation as he was very well thought of by Saints' academy,\" says Bedford's Alex Woolford.\n\"This viral clip of him did the rounds among us. He was being interviewed after an England Under-18 win over South Africa and swore three times in about 10 seconds.\n\"We knew he was going to be very enthusiastic.\"\nHe was.\n\"We were pretty poor in the first half against Ampthill,\" adds Woolford, remembering Pollock's first start.\n\"Henry tried to give us the hairdryer treatment. He was effing and blinding and telling us we were not good enough and I remember thinking 'bloody hell, what is this kid doing?'\n\"But you have to give him credit.\n\"In rugby environments it is very easy to get confidence confused with arrogance. For all the stick he gets, I don't actually think he is an arrogant person.\"\nPollock spent part of the 2023-24 season on loan at Championship side Bedford\nStill, that perception persists.\nFreeman and Woolford say Pollock is a different, calmer character off the pitch, and his Northampton team-mates assured the rest of the England camp that the incoming youngster wasn't the \"idiot\" they were expecting., external \nTheir PR work was duly undermined by Pollock gleefully ripping the ball from Ollie Chessum when tasked with holding a tackle shield in an early training drill.\n\"Probably some of the boys were quite shocked with how I was when I first joined up with England,\" Pollock told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"But I guess over time they realised this is just him.\n\"I am quite loud, someone that just brings a different type of energy to other types of players. Whether that is good or bad energy depends who you are talking to.\"\nPollock scored two tries when he made his senior England debut off the bench against Wales in Cardiff in March\nThere are plenty of fans.\nAt Franklin's Gardens kids wear his distinctive black head tape and make cardboard signs asking for Pollock's boots.\nThey love his celebrations. A basketball-style finger-roll lob in the direction of a beaten defender against Castres and an extravagant swallow dive against Bristol were two recent efforts. \nThey love his cunning. Pollock cheekily pulling the sock of Wales prop Gareth Thomas to milk a penalty gained social media traction during the Six Nations.\nAnd they love his abrasive style as he goes nose-to-nose with the opposition, raising tempers and the stakes.\n\"I want to entertain and get the crowd as close as possible to the team,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton's Saints Show.\n\"When I was growing up there, there was a lack of a idols. There were one or two that stick in my mind - Courtney Lawes, Michael Hooper, Richie McCaw - but not many.\n\"For this game to grow and this sport to get bigger, we need more characters, more players the fans want to come and watch.\n\"If you look to the football world, fans very much have their players and the personalities they like.\"\nThis video can not be played\nPollock ruffling feathers!\nPollock is harder to warm to when you are up against him.\nWoolford, Pollock's Bedford team-mate, also faced him in the Blues' annual pre-season fixture against Saints.\n\"On the pitch he is very loud, very confrontational, very in-your-face,\" Woolford remembers.\n\"He just exhausts you, as much mentally and emotionally as physically. But he has backed it up at every level he has stepped up to.\"\nIn the teams' most recent match, one Bedford player attempted to sledge back at Pollock, suggesting he would be back with the Blues on loan by October.\nInstead, by then, Pollock was a Premiership regular.\n\"Being annoying is part of my game,\" Pollock agrees.\n\"I want to wind the opposition up; I want to get under their skin. It is something I relish.\"\nThis weekend he will be digging into Leinster in a re-run of last season's Champions Cup semi-final.\nThe Irish giants could field back-row trio Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier and Jack Conan.\n\"It is probably one of the best back rows there is,\" says Pollock. \"I am just excited to be able to say I played against them. To share the field with them is special.\"\nBut the deference won't last past the first whistle.\n\"They are beatable,\" he adds. \"We definitely see parts of their game we can attack and go after and hopefully ruffle a few feathers.\"\nIf Pollock's streak of success extends to the Aviva Stadium and his final and toughest Lions audition, he could well make the squad cut five days later.\n\"I have heard the rumours and stuff, but as a player you can't control that,\" he says.\n\"I just have to keep playing well, and if it happens, it happens.\"\nSo far in his career, things invariably do.\nPollock played in England A's win over an Australia second string at the start of this season before being promoted into the senior side",

He is likely to be joined in the squad by Matthew Potts (10 caps), Josh Tongue (two) and uncapped Essex man Sam Cook.\nA combination in the XI of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook would have 13 caps between them. Not since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago has England's pace attack looked so callow at home, when Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Richard Johnson had a combined seven caps.\nIndeed, England have played only one home Test without any of Woakes, Anderson or Stuart Broad in the past 18 years.\nAlthough Zimbabwe are improving \u2013 they have just earned a creditable 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh \u2013 England will be overwhelming favourites to win the four-day Test when it begins on 22 May.\nFollowing that, the five-match series at home to India and the Ashes away in Australia this winter will shape the leadership legacies of Stokes, coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.\n'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nWe've said naive things, but we do care - Wood\nWoakes has not played yet this season because of an ankle problem, while Wood is out until July following knee surgery.\nBrydon Carse remains sidelined with a foot problem and Olly Stone will not play before the back end of the summer after his own knee operation. Ollie Robinson, who has won 20 Test caps, has not played for England in more than a year and lost his central contract in October.\nAll-rounder Stokes, with 210 Test wickets, has more scalps than any other active England bowler, though his bowling is likely to be restricted. An injury sustained in the third Test against New Zealand in December was the second time in five months the talismanic captain had hurt his left hamstring.\nStokes will look to build his bowling in the run-up to the India series, when England will hope to have Woakes and Carse available. Jofra Archer could play his first red-ball game in four years for England Lions against India A in June. Speaking on Wednesday, Wood did not rule out a return for the conclusion of the India series.\nFor now, Atkinson will lead the attack following his stunning debut year in Test cricket while Potts played in England's last Test in New Zealand.\nTongue has not played for England for two years because of injuries but has enjoyed a superb start to the season with Nottinghamshire.\nCook, 27, has been the outstanding bowler in domestic cricket for some time, grabbing 318 first-class wickets at an average under 20.\nHe is not blessed with high pace and has had to wait for his chance, yet an indication an England call-up was on the horizon came when it was requested he be rested from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire last month.\nIf England feel they want further pace cover in the squad, it could come from 20-year-old left-armer Josh Hull, who made his Test debut last summer, or Hampshire's exciting prospect Sonny Baker. Baker has played only three first-class matches but was given an England development contract in February.\nOther areas of selection look more straightforward. Jamie Smith will return behind the stumps after missing the tour of New Zealand on paternity leave, while there is no suggestion Shoaib Bashir's place as the number one spinner is under threat.\nAny decisions over the top five will be delayed by Jacob Bethell's stint at the Indian Premier League.

That tells you how unique and beautiful this is.\n\"We are making history. It's a beautiful story right now - but we want much more.\"\nArsenal's season has been hampered by injuries to key players including Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Ben White.\nThey have won only one of their past four Premier League matches, which helped Liverpool clinch the title on Sunday with four games to spare.\nBut in Europe they have won six of their eight league-phase games and also beat PSV Eindhoven 9-3 on aggregate in the last 16 on their way to the semi-finals. \nArteta added: \"The fact that we are here as one of the four best teams in Europe, it tells about the mindset, spirit and how much we really want it.\" \nHis squad will be boosted by the return of Mikel Merino and White to training, but Arteta also challenged the Gunners faithful to create an even better atmosphere than in the 3-0 win against Real Madrid. \n\"I'm not exaggerating. Guys, bring your boots, your shorts and T-shirt and let's play every ball together,\" said Areta, who is eyeing his first major silverware at the club since the FA Cup in 2020. \n\"You want to do something special?

I think we're a better team and we've shown that throughout the competition. \n\"We had the toughest league phase. At first I thought it was detrimental, but in the end it was positive because it helped us progress.\n\"We are a more complete team and we now want to write a page in history.\" \nPSG, who were crowned domestic champions again this month, are aiming for a first Champions League title despite the exits of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar. \nAfter beating fellow French club Brest 10-0 on aggregate in the play-offs, they overcame successive English opponents in Liverpool and Aston Villa.\nBefore the semi-final, Luis Enrique said he sees similarities between his side and Arteta's Arsenal.\n\"They are built as a team with collective strength - you can see that from the way they attack and defend,\" he said.\n\"They do everything together.

        "article_text": "A 29-year-old doctor from Bristol has had her eyesight saved after a \"game-changing\" test identified a mystery infection that had plagued her health for five years.\nEllie Irwin suffered persistent inflammation in her right eye that didn't go away, resulting in blurred vision. No treatment helped and at one point she even considered having her eye removed.\nIt was only after Ellie was offered a \"last resort\" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.\n\"It's been transformative,\" Ellie told the BBC. \"I feel so fortunate.\"\nProfessor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a \"breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases\". \n\"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible,\" he says.\nIn 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.\nEllie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.\n\"It was completely dominating my life,\" Ellie says. \"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.\n\"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better.\"\nThe treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.\nEllie says she eventually reached \"breaking point\", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.\n\"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,\" she says, \"my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.\"\nIt was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.\nMetagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.\nA team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.\nCurrently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.\nFor viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.\nHowever, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.\n\"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one,\" she says. \"So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it.\"\nDr Brown says metagenomics is \"an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer\".\nIn Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.\nIt is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.\nEllie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.\n\"I broke down - I just had to cry. I never imagined that it would come back positive and be for something that was treatable,\" she says. \n\"I was given three weeks of antibiotics and within days my vision was clearer and the inflammation subsided.\"\nA single metagenomics test costs around \u00a31,300, which is far more than standard diagnostics. However, as the technology is developed that price is likely to fall rapidly.\nVirologist Professor Judy Breuer, who has been developing metagenomics at GOSH and University College London (UCL) for more than a decade, says her team currently receives three or four samples a week from hospitals around the UK for metagenomic testing in addition to those it carries out on its own patients.\nThese are often samples from parts of the body that are normally sterile sites, where bacteria are not usually found such as the brain, central nervous system, liver and eye.\n\"In the future, we think metagenomics will become a first line test and be able to diagnose infection in any sample, probably within the same day,\" she says.\nIt's also likely to become faster, cheaper and easier to do, explains Dr Brown, meaning it will become available to more patients rather than just a small number who are severely unwell.\nResolving her eye problems has allowed Ellie to concentrate on her training as a GP and arrange her wedding. \nEllie was married in Newcastle on 29 March, the same day the city celebrated   Newcastle United's win in the Carabao Cup.\nShe says: \"We got a shout-out from Ant and Dec and went up on a scissor lift above the Newcastle United fans, which was incredible.\"\nProf Breuer says she is thrilled with how the treatment is changing lives.\n\"It is amazing to see the impact it is having for patients like Ellie.\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

        "article_text": "The government has made very little progress in preparing the UK for the growing threats posed by rising temperatures since coming to power, its climate watchdog has warned.\nIn a highly critical report, the independent Climate Change Committee says progress is \"either too slow, has stalled, or is heading in the wrong direction\".\nFrom hospitals and care homes to food and water supplies, this could leave the UK vulnerable to serious economic and health impacts in the decades ahead, the CCC warns.\nIn response, the government pointed to its investment in flood defences, but acknowledged more work was needed. \nFloods Minister Emma Hardy told BBC News that preparing for the changing climate was \"something we're really committed to\".\n\"We are putting \u00a32.65bn into upgrading, maintaining and building new flood defences.\n\"But we absolutely know, of course, there's more that needs to be done.\"\nFuelled by climate change, the UK's weather extremes are intensifying, from the 40C heat of July 2022 to England's wettest 18 months on record between October 2022 to March 2024.\nSuch events are only likely to become more severe and happen more often, as the planet continues to get hotter due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases.\nBetter preparation can limit the damage by making the country more resilient, but the CCC says this is not happening at anywhere near the required pace.\n\"We are seeing climate impact happening faster and more intensely and increasing [but] government just doesn't yet seem to be taking it seriously,\" Baroness Brown, chair of the Adaptation Committee at the CCC, told BBC News.\n\"The manifesto said it was going to address this issue of resilience and yet, so far, it's done nothing,\" she added.\n\"We've heard some warm words\u2026 but nothing has come out yet.\"\nNone of the 46 areas assessed were found to be making \"good\" progress in adapting to climate change. Only three had \"good\" plans and policies in place for the future.\nThese are mostly unchanged from the CCC's last report in 2023.\nHealth is one of the areas that remains most poorly prepared.\nThe CCC points to the rising number of deaths linked to extreme heat and hospitals themselves being vulnerable to hot weather.\nBaroness Brown highlights the case of Guy's and St Thomas', the biggest hospital trust in London, which was hit by a failure to its data centres during the extreme heat of July 2022.\nThis meant it was unable to operate its appointments system at a time of intense demand, and it had to move to paper appointments.\n\"We lost thousands of crucial appointments for people for critical tests,\" she said.\n\"We're trying to improve the NHS. Unless we take into account that it has to be resilient to the climate, we're going backwards.\"\nFlooding is another challenging area. Plans and policies to ensure places are resilient to river and coastal flooding are found to have worsened since the CCC's previous report.\nThe ancient town of Tenbury Wells in Worcestershire is a case in point. It's been flooded repeatedly in the last four years, most recently in November 2024.\nPolly Pearce described how her charity shop flooded.\n\"It was so quick...  [like] a tsunami,\" she said.\n\"[The water] came up as high as the panelling right up on the wall... we had all our Christmas stuff ready but lost it.\"\nThe main street is studded with empty shops, many reportedly put out of business by the cost of repeated floods. \nShop owners say insurance companies either won't insure their properties or that the premiums are now so high many shop keepers say they simply can't afford it.\nAnd the Environment Agency has said it can't afford the \u00a325m-\u00a330m cost of flood protection for the town. \nThe government says it is committed to helping residents, however, and that work to improve the flood resilience of properties will begin in the summer.\nThe CCC notes progress in some other areas of climate adaptation, such as plans to identify risks to businesses and financial institutions.\nAt the heart of these discussions is the question of cost.\nBut putting off efforts to prepare the UK for the changing climate in an attempt to save cash would be \"a huge mistake\" and could increase economic damage in the long run, Baroness Brown said.\n\"We are very worried about their spending review,\" she added, in an unusually strong plea from the Committee.\n\"This is not a tomorrow problem; it's a today problem. If we don't address it today, it becomes a disaster tomorrow.\"\nA freedom of information request submitted by the BBC found there are just 18 members of staff working fully on climate adaptation at the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra).\nThat's just 0.3% of Defra's nearly 6,600 full-time-equivalent core staff.\nDefra said some of these employees also worked on climate adaptation part-time, and the figures don't include those working in other parts of government.\n\nAdditional reporting by Miho Tanaka\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

We have had a poor season, especially in the league. We've been very good in Europe, but the league season has been unacceptable.\n\"He's my manager, he's my gaffer and I respect him an awful amount. The narrative [of Postecoglou's job being under threat] is something we players are trying to keep away from because it's not healthy.\n\"I just know that I come into work every day and see the lads listening and taking on the messages on how he wants us to play and doing the best for this club and we are in a real good position in Europe, where we can still have a special season under his management.\n\"I will continue to do that until the day he isn't here.\"\nSpurs will be without captain Son Heung-min, who is unavailable with a foot injury, against Bodo/Glimt but Maddison says the club are going to \"relish the challenge\" of reaching a first European final since they were beaten by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League showpiece.\n\"It's huge,\" the England midfielder added. \n\"When you get to the end of your career and you look back, there's not many times a player has been in European semi-finals. Maybe once or twice if you are lucky.\n\"We need to use that. We are in the final four in a massive competition in Europe and use that to have a great tie on Thursday and in Bodo as well.\n\"We've got a real special opportunity. There's obviously been a lot of talk about form and being a poor season, but we have the opportunity to do something very special. \n\"We've earned it and we deserve to be here. It is a challenge we are going to relish.\"\nBodo/Glimt chiefs calm on Knutsen future amid Leeds links\nChelsea keen on Rogers - Wednesday's gossip\nAnge Postecoglou signed James Maddison from Leicester City in June 2023\nBodo/Glimt reached the semi-finals with victory over Lazio on penalties in the last round and Postecoglou has dismissed his side's tag as favourites.\n\"Bodo are there on merit,\" said the Australian manager.\n\"They are there because they are a good football team. It doesn't matter where you come from. I come from the other side of the world where football is the fourth sport, so I don't underestimate anyone.\n\"You say they are a small club and we are big club, it doesn't matter. We are two clubs in the semi-final of a European competition and they have earned the right to be there.\n\"They have done very well to get there and we are going to treat them with the respect they deserve. At the same time, make sure we go in there and give it our best performance.\"\nThe 59-year-old also says Tottenham's success in Europe is being \"diminished\" by some people amid the backdrop of their league form.\nHe added: \"I am really strong at the moment on the parallel worlds we are trying to traverse and I have sensed, which is not surprising because this is the way this club is perceived, people are almost trying to diminish it in some respects.\n\"I have seen some people saying it is the equivalent of Manchester United winning the FA Cup, no. Not on any planet is it equivalent. That is suggesting that maybe we are not worthy of Champions League.\n\"Things are there that are designed to diminish what is ahead of us, which is an unbelievable opportunity.

We've been very good in Europe, but the league season has been unacceptable. \"Spurs will be without captain Son Heung-min, who is unavailable with a foot injury, against Bodo/Glimt but Maddison says the club are going to \"relish the challenge\" of reaching a first European final since they were beaten by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League showpiece. \"The 59-year-old also says Tottenham's success in Europe is being \"diminished\" by some people amid the backdrop of their league form.He added: \"I am really strong at the moment on the parallel worlds we are trying to traverse and I have sensed, which is not surprising because this is the way this club is perceived, people are almost trying to diminish it in some respects.",

        "article_text": "The Spanish grid operator has ruled out a cyber attack as the cause of a massive power cut that crippled Spain, Portugal and parts of France on Monday. \nRed El\u00e9ctrica's operations director Eduardo Prieto said preliminary findings suggest \"there was no kind of interference in the control systems\" to imply an attack, echoing Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro the day before.\nBut the exact reason behind the cut is still unclear. \nThe grid operator said on Tuesday they \"cannot draw conclusions\" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures \"to ensure that this does not happen again.\"\nInformation is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.\nHere is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.\nFollow live: Travel chaos continues\nS\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".\nMr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.\nOne issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.\nHowever, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.\nSo what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.\nThe mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50HRZ in Europe and the UK.\nIf that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.\n\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.\nIf lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.\nBut when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.\nRenewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.\n\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.\nProf Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.\n\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.\n\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"\nRed El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.\nTwo basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines called AC/DC lines.\nSpain has an AC/DC line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.\nThe Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.\nS\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.\nPortugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.\nThe message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".\n\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\" \nHowever, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

Maybe their best ever achievement,\" said Davis.\nFifteen years ago, Davis defeated Mark King 10-9 in the Crucible first round, won 13-11 against a then-34-year-old Higgins, the reigning champion, before losing 13-5 to eventual winner Neil Robertson in the last eight.\n\"It was a fantastic buzz, I maybe ran out of belief,\" recalled Davis.\n\"Hopefully they don't do that. They are much more in touch with the top part of the game than I was.\"\nMark Williams and John Higgins at the China Open in March 2006\nThe trio's achievements are legendary. O'Sullivan has seven world titles, Higgins four and Williams three.\nIf any of them lift the trophy on Monday, 5 May, they would become the oldest winner in the modern era, breaking O'Sullivan's record when he won it three years ago, aged 46.\nThirty-three years ago they were all hungry, driven, talented teenagers with the desire to reach the top.\nWilliams described how he first met Higgins at the final of an event in 1990, when they were both 15.\n\"We played in the final and he beat me,\" said the Welshman. \"It was live on TV and he beat me 6-1, he had five grand for a win, I had three grand for runner-up.\n\"We then played in the British Under-16s in Birmingham and I thrashed him 4-0 after 50 minutes and I got 200 quid so I was a week late.\n\"That was the first time I really remembered John as it was me and O'Sullivan playing in all the junior events when we were 13 and 14.\"\nWilliams and Higgins have their own Crucible history and have met five times, with four victories for Williams, including an 18-16 success in an epic showdown in the 2018 final.\n\"That world final was one of the best games I've ever been involved in and people say it was the best final ever,\" said Williams.\nWilliams hopes eye surgery in June will help to extend his snooker career\nKen Doherty, the 1997 world champion, played against the 'Class of 92' throughout his career and felt this match was \"the tie of the round\".\n\"They've been at the top of the game since 1992, 33 years, and are still at the top and still producing,\" the Irishman said.\n\"As you get older it becomes a lot more difficult as players like me, Stephen Hendry, Alan McManus, Peter Ebdon have all found out. It's hard to cope in terms of tension, intensity and also to be able to devote your life to the game.\n\"You become a father, a family man and it's hard to dedicate themselves to the game but they still have the appetite, willingness and hunger and that's an incredible talent as well.\n\"I've been logging heads with them for 30 years. I've beaten them all but also lost to them all in big finals. I just had great times playing them and you used to relish it as it was a great test of your own game.\"\nDoherty, who is part of the BBC TV team for the competition, felt the atmosphere would be electric.\n\"When you see them coming into the Crucible for their match they will get a standing ovation as they did in the Masters,\" he added. \"We might not see the kind of these three again so we have to enjoy them while we can. They've given the sport great entertainment, great matches and are still delivering.\"\nShaun Murphy tipped Judd Trump, who beat him 13-10 on Monday, to win the title but thought the Williams-Higgins clash would be \"fabulous for the sport\".\nHe added: \"The Class of 92 are three of the best players we've ever seen and it's wonderful we still get to watch them.\n\"None of them would be here if they didn't want to be, they obviously love it enough to put themselves through it.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan became the oldest man in the modern era to become world champion with his victory over Judd Trump in the 2022 final\nWorld number one Trump will play the winner of Williams-Higgins in the semi-final if he triumphs in his own quarter-final against Luca Brecel.\nTrump felt the veteran trio would continue to feature at the top level for years to come.\n\"They inspired me a little bit, especially Ronnie and John when I was younger,\" said Trump. \"Ronnie was someone I really looked up to. They're miles away from retiring and not far from their absolute best.\n\"When I played Williams in the semi-finals (when Trump won a final-frame decider for a 17-16 win in 2022) I've never seen him play like that.\n\"These three could be here when they're 65 if they wanted to be.\"",

The blue I played was probably one of my best shots for many years,\" Williams told BBC Sport.\n\"What a blue...balls of steel. It was tough a shot. I could have gone in-off. I could have over cut it. I just went for it full-blooded.\n\"There was not one bit of nerves, maybe I've only had them a handful of times in my entire career.\"\nWilliams' victory over Higgins means he will face Luca Brecel or world number one Judd Trump in the semi-finals.\nWatch World Snooker Championship 2025: Williams beats Higgins in decider - reaction\n'How are we still here?' - Class of 92 graduates thrill Crucible again\nMark Williams has reached the World Championship semi-finals eight times\nWhile world number six Williams has generally held sway over his fellow 'Class of 92' rival in Sheffield - winning five of their six meetings - it was still a first loss in a decider for Higgins at the Crucible since 1996.\nHowever, the prospect of it living up to the thriller they served up in the 2018 final, in which the Welshman eventually triumphed 18-16, appeared unlikely to materialise after the first four frames of the morning.\nWhile Williams said he belted out 'Delilah' by Tom Jones to inspire him before arriving, Higgins had appeared out of sorts and out of rhythm until the mid-session interval and only when he reappeared did he resemble the player that recently won the World Open and Tour Championship.\n\"I was poor the first four frames, but after the interval I had nothing to lose and played maybe the best four-frame burst of the whole event,\" said the Scot.\n\"I had my chance. If I pot the brown and roll through, maybe the blue is unmissable, but you are under that much pressure. \n\"It was an incredible atmosphere.

        "article_text": "After great reviews and buzz, Ryan Coogler's vampire film had an extraordinary second weekend at the box office. It's a victory for a wholly original big-budget film in a cinema landscape dominated by familiar franchises.\nIn less than a fortnight since it was released, Sinners has already made more money at the US box office than Disney's Snow White. Could Ryan Coogler's vampire film go on to overtake two more of this year's Disney hits, Mufasa: The Lion King and Captain America: Brave New World? It's definitely possible. The Hollywood Reporter calls Sinners a \"rule-defying\" proposition that \"continues to defy all the odds\", because it was almost as lucrative in its second weekend in US cinemas as it was in its first, earning $45m (\u00a334m) against its opening $48m (\u00a336m). \"Put another way, Sinners boasts the smallest second-weekend decline for any film opening north of $40m since 2009's Avatar and the smallest ever for an R-rated horror title,\" says the article. Meanwhile The Wrap predicts that it will be \"the highest-grossing original live-action film in the US since Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity in 2013\". Its current worldwide box office total stands at $161m (\u00a3120m), against a $90m (\u00a367m) budget, and it likely has a long distance left to run. Sinners is a winner \u2013 just a week after a sceptical article by Variety sniffed that \"profitability remains a question mark\".\nPerhaps this shouldn't come as a shock. The director of Creed and the Black Panther films, Coogler is adept at taking familiar Hollywood genres (sports drama, superhero blockbuster) and putting his own distinctive-yet-crowd-pleasing stamp on them. But he has gone a step further than usual this time. Featuring Michael B Jordan as a pair of twins defending their juke joint from vampires, Sinners is a horror film \u2013 but it's also a blues musical, a gangster thriller and a deeply-researched period drama about Mississippi in the 1930s. It doesn't stick to the rules of one particular genre, and it isn't based on existing intellectual property (IP), so audiences don't come to it knowing how it's all going to play out. Thanks also to some carefully-vague trailers, viewers get to discover the story for themselves \u2013 which is an increasingly rare treat. Reviewing a new Hollywood film often comes down to answering one question: \"Is it slightly better or slightly worse than every other Marvel/ DC/ Star Wars/ Alien /Jurassic World/ King Kong film I've seen?\" But Sinners is idiosyncratic enough to prompt other questions, which may explain its box office momentum, as word-of-mouth has spread.\nThis unorthodox quality is a sign of the freedom that Coogler felt when he was making it. All of his previous films were adapted from other material \u2013 or from true events, in the case of his debut, Fruitvale Station \u2013 but he told The Atlantic that with Sinners, he didn't want to use IP as \"something to hide behind\". He wanted to make the most personal film he could \u2013 a \"love letter\" to a late uncle from Mississippi \u2013 and that meant a film which didn't follow conventions.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 10 of the best films of 2025 so far\n\u2022 The best films to watch in April\n\u2022 Warfare review: it 'does what film does best'\nIn some ways it could be filed alongside two other films with \"must-see\" and \"must-talk-about\" appeal, 2024's The Substance and 2023's Saltburn. Sinners is a far bigger commercial success than they were, but each offer transgressive, sexually charged, gore-smeared excitement, none of them is based on a superhero comic, a video game or an earlier film, and each expresses the vision of a writer-director being allowed to do their own thing. (And their titles all begin with S, but that could be a coincidence.) The fact that it is so tricky to say which genre they belong to is a key factor. Is The Substance primarily a body-horror film or a Hollywood satire? Is Saltburn a crime thriller or a class comedy? All of these films stir different ingredients together to cook something unexpected. As Coogler put it to The Atlantic: \"I wanted it to feel like you were reading Salem's Lot while listening to the best blues record, eating a bowl of spicy gumbo.\"\nThat could be why, anecdotes suggest, many people are already paying to see Sinners more than once. Because it isn't a generic, IP-based exercise, they know that they're going to discover more on a second viewing. And they know that they're going to have a good time while they're doing it. Maybe if they go for third and fourth viewings, too, Hollywood might decide that original, auteur-driven, big-budget films shouldn't be quite as rare in the cinema landscape as they are today.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Dropping down to the fifth round at pick 144 overall was a surprise though, as five other quarterbacks were taken before him - including by the Cleveland Browns who eventually picked up Sanders.Sanders had a lavish draft party set up but had to watch as pick by pick and round by round went by without his name being called, and although he took it with good grace that really would have hurt.Some say he has an entitled, arrogant personality that caused his slide, some say it was personal - but now he has to prove himself in a crowded quarterback room in Cleveland at a team that picked six other players, including a quarterback, ahead of him.And such is the new way of college athletes being able to get paid, Sanders has already earned millions as a big name with lucrative marketing deals - but his draft slide has cost him, as his fifth-round contract will be about $5m (\u00a33.7m), when even being a low first-round pick would have earned him about $18m (\u00a313.5m).Sanders selected by Browns as NFL Draft's 144th pickPublished4 days agoDid the confusing Cleveland Browns win or lose?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Was Sanders always the plan for the Cleveland Browns?All you want to see from your team at the draft is a plan, and if the Browns have one they disguised it pretty well. It could still be a success if a number of gambles pay off - notably passing up the chance to pick Hunter, which could be a massive mistake if he becomes a league legend.The extra first-round pick they have next year though could make it look inspired.And then there is picking Sanders as their second quarterback, after also selecting Dillon Gabriel earlier.The expensive but injured Deshaun Watson, veteran former Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett are joined by two rookies all vying for a starting spot.A best case scenario sees both Gabriel and Sanders push each other into a genuine quarterback battle with both being quality choices, but it could also lead to more misery at the position for the Browns.And famous father Deion Sanders will not be quiet in the background if things do not go his son's way.Brady's Raiders solid and get a starThe Las Vegas Raiders have made some dodgy picks down the years, but with veteran head coach Pete Carroll and part-owner Tom Brady to lean on, first-time general manager John Spytek delivered a very solid draft.He made 11 pretty reasonable picks - starting with a star running back in Ashton Jeanty who together with veteran quarterback Geno Smith could give the offence new life.They picked two wide receivers and added a third with Montana State quarterback Tommy Mellott expected to switch to wideout and special teams.And Brady will certainly have been consulted about their sixth-round quarterback selection Cam Miller from North Dakota State.Miller had 9,721 passing yards and 81 touchdowns in college, but also ran for 2,277 yards and 48 rushing scores, so could be one to watch if he develops as Smith's back-up.Aggressive Atlanta overpay - then Sanders apologyThe Atlanta Falcons needed a pass rush but maybe they went overboard trying to solve it, when not only selecting Jalon Walker with the 15th pick overall but also doing an ambitious trade to get back into the first round.They gave up a first rounder next year to draft James Pearce Jr, by no means a slam dunk, and a hefty price to pay for a bit of a swing.Atalanta have form though as they drafted quarterback Michaal Penix Jr in last year's first round despite handing Kirk Cousins $100m just before it.The questionable trade was followed by sheer embarrassment as it emerged the son of Atlanta's defensive co-ordinator Jeff Ulbrich made a prank call to Sanders pretending to be the New Orleans Saints about to draft him.The Falcons issued an apology, as did 21-year-old Jax Ulbrich, but it still left a bitter taste.Related topicsSuper BowlAmerican FootballMore on this storyFalcons apologise to Sanders over prank callPublished3 days ago",

        "article_text": "The latest in the superhero franchise \"is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun\", with a \"charismatic\" Florence Pugh at its centre, writes Nicholas Barber.\nEver since Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, the subtitle has felt a lot more appropriate than the studio might have liked. It's not that Marvel hasn't had any hits in the 2020s, but it is no longer releasing an unbroken chain of talked-about blockbusters, nor is it keeping audiences invested in a story that threads through all of them. That particular game has come to an end.\nThe Marvel films that have worked best since Endgame are the ones that have moved furthest away from the pattern set by the so-called \"Infinity Saga\" \u2013 the first 22 instalments in the franchise, which pivoted around a fight against uber-villain Thanos. Last year's R-rated Deadpool & Wolverine used almost no characters from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); the postmodern Spider-Man: No Way Home paid tribute to the Spider-Man films which weren't made by Marvel Studios; and the latest Marvel film, Thunderbolts*, has its own distinct identity, too. That's not to suggest that it isn't a part of the MCU. In fact, one of its clever touches is that it specifically addresses how gloomy people feel in a world where Iron Man, Thor and Captain America are no longer around. But the director, Jake Shreier, and the screenwriters, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, have come up with an unruly take on the superhero genre which makes it the most refreshing MCU offering in years.\nThe key is that, rather than trying to be as glossy and expansive as the Infinity Saga films, Thunderbolts* is scrappy, scruffy-looking, down-to-earth fun. It isn't the epic tale of indestructible titans saving the Universe, let alone the multiverse; it's a comedy-tinged caper about bungling secret agents who are deemed a liability by the very company that used to employ them. It's not a new scenario: after The Bourne Identity, there were countless action films in which disavowed spies dodged their erstwhile handlers. But Thunderbolts* stands out because it has a whole group of such spies: a ragtag bunch of depressive, dysfunctional loners who must work together and can't stop grumbling about it. What's especially unusual about the film, in Marvel terms, is that its premise would be viable even if the characters weren't super-powered. And, indeed, they aren't all that super-powered compared to the aforementioned Captain America and Thor. Part of their appeal is that they can be killed by bullets and trapped in rooms with locked doors, which makes them a lot easier to relate to than Norse gods.\nThere's a lesson there that the makers of such disappointments as Eternals and The Marvels should have learnt. It's not the characters' powers that count; it's their personalities. In Thunderbolts*, those characters are Yelena (Florence Pugh), a Russian assassin who was the adoptive sister of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and is now deeply miserable about all the mindless violence in her life; her adoptive father, Red Guardian (David Harbour), a washed-up slob who is nostalgic for his days as a national hero; the bionic-armed Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who was Captain America's sidekick in World War Two, and still seems uncomfortable in the 21st Century; John Walker (Wyatt Russell), an embittered super-soldier who was supposed to be the new Captain America, but wasn't up to the job; the confused, conflicted Bob (Lewis Pullman), another flawed attempt to create a Captain America substitute; and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), who is a science experiment gone wrong \u2013 but who, unlike the other characters, isn't very well defined beyond that. In various ways, they are all connected to one of Marvel's most memorably slippery villains, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a businesswoman with all the brittle, condescending confidence that you might expect from the reliably excellent star of Seinfeld and Veep.\nDe Fontaine, it seems, has been behind several superhero-related black ops. Now that her political opponents are closing in on her, she decides to destroy all the evidence of her shady undertakings, including the people who carried them out. And so it is that Yelena and the others switch from trying to kill each other to trying to keep each other alive. They become a sort-of team, but they aren't sure whether or not to call themselves the Thunderbolts, so the asterisk in the title signifies that it's just a placeholder name until they can think of something better.\nThunderbolts*\nDirector: Jake Schreier\nCast: Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Pierce, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nRuntime: 2hr 16min\nOne small snag is that most of the characters' back stories are in other films, and in a TV series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, rather than in Thunderbolts* itself. Another snag is that the gang's pursuit by De Fontaine's troops accounts for the majority of the film's running time, so there aren't many set pieces that haven't been in the trailers already. On the other hand, superhero films are rarely so tightly focused, and rarely progress so seamlessly from scene to scene, with no pausing for breath, and no sudden jumps to different ends of the Earth. Captain America: Brave New World, which came out in February, was similar to Thunderbolts* in that it revolved around Washington DC politics, and followed on from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. But that film was a messy sprawl, whereas this one is so neatly plotted that you can get the gist and enjoy the ride whether you're a Marvel nerd or not.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 A combat epic that 'does what film does best'\n\u2022 Disney's Snow White has a major 'identity crisis'\n\u2022 Mickey 17 is a 'disappointment' \nThe underlying issues in Thunderbolts* are just as focused as the narrative. The characters all have to deal with the shame and trauma of their troubled pasts \u2013 and this theme is there from the opening scene to the requisite Final Battle, which is slightly rushed, but stylishly surreal enough to recall two mind-bending films written by Charlie Kaufman, Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In between, the characters' guilt is explored in some touching and surprisingly brutal sequences, as well as in some sharply-scripted, briskly-edited and skilfully-performed comic scenes.\u00a0\nAt both ends of the spectrum, Pugh delivers a performance which would win her awards if it weren't in a superhero film. She delivers her punchlines with expert timing, especially when she is bickering and bantering with Red Guardian. But she can also radiate raw emotion \u2013 and all while maintaining a decent Russian accent and cartwheeling through her acrobatic fight scenes. When it comes down to it, that's why Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as Pugh at its centre.\u00a0\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Liverpool FC's victory at the weekend has clinched them their second Premier League title but it also resulted in something curious \u2013 producing a strange series of numbers in the league's record books.\nSomething remarkable has just happened in English football. Liverpool FC have been crowned Premier League champions for a second time. When added to their 18 pre-Premier League titles, it means they now equal Manchester United's record of being English champions 20 times. But while fans of the club will no doubt be celebrating this moment of triumph, another astounding facet of their achievement has caught the attention of mathematicians.\nLiverpool's title win has completed the opening of an exceptional set of numbers that has been 33 years in the making. The sequence emerges when we rank Liverpool alongside the other clubs that have won the Premier League since it was first formed in 1992, listing them by the number of titles won, starting with the lowest. As you can see in the table below, the number of Premier League titles goes as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.\nTo the untrained eye, this sequence might not seem significant. But it will be enough to get many maths aficionados excited. They will recognise this as\u00a0the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the previous two in the sequence.\nThe sequence can be found in an astonishing array of places \u2013 from the spirals of seeds on\u00a0sunflower heads\u00a0and the bracts of\u00a0pinecones\u00a0to\u00a0family tree patterns in some species of animals.\nFibonacci sequences (sequences in the plural because starting with a different pair of initial numbers and following the rule of adding consecutive numbers to generate the next gives you a different, but related sequence) were first\u00a0introduced to European science in 1202 by Leonardo of Pisa, also known by his nickname Fibonacci (meaning son of\u00a0Bonaccio).\nLong before Fibonacci popularised the sequences in his book Liber Abaci, however, the sequences had been known to Indian Mathematicians. They had drawn upon the sequences to help them enumerate the number of possible poems of a given length, using short syllables of one-unit duration and long syllables of two-unit duration. The Indian poet/mathematicians knew that you could make a poem of length n by taking a poem of length n-1 and adding a short syllable or a poem of length n-2 and adding a long syllable. Consequently, they figured out that to work out the number of poems of a given length you just had to add the number of poems that were one syllable shorter to the number that were two syllables shorter \u2013 the exact rule we use today to define a Fibonacci sequence.\nHidden in the sequences is another important and related mathematical mainstay \u2013 the golden ratio. As the terms in a Fibonacci sequence get larger, the ratio of each term to the one preceding it gets closer and closer to the golden ratio \u2013 approximated to 1.61803 by the first few places in its decimal expansion. The golden ratio is hypothesised to govern the arrangement of leaves on the stem of some plant species and supposedly leads to aesthetically pleasing results when applied in art, architecture and music.\nFibonacci sequences are often held up by mathematicians as exemplars of the beauty of mathematics. They can provide vivid visual examples of maths written into the patterns of the real world, without which many non-mathematicians can struggle to understand the elegance we see in our subject. In our over-enthusiasm to proselytise, however, there is a temptation to cast Fibonacci sequences or the golden ratio as some sort of all-encompassing natural law governing phenomena across orders of magnitude, from the spiral shapes of nautilus shells to vortices of hurricanes to the curved arms of galaxies.\nIn reality, although these natural features are aesthetically pleasing, very few of them conform to the rules of the Fibonacci sequence or exhibit the golden ratio. We must be careful that we don't try to shoehorn every beautiful pattern into the delicate Fibonacci glass slipper \u2013 to suggest causation and impose meaning where there is none.\nIt's extraordinary, then, to find the Fibonacci sequence cropping up in a place as unexpected as the Premier League. When, as scientists, we spot a well-known sequence like this appearing seemingly out of the blue, we should start to ask ourselves whether it tells us anything important about the process that generated the sequence. Is there some surprising unseen process underlying Premier League title battles or is it nothing more than a cute coincidence? Just because we can see a Fibonacci sequence in something doesn't mean it is there for a reason.\nNonetheless, spotting these sorts of seeming coincidences can be extremely useful for the process of scientific discovery. In 1912, for example, Alfred Wegener noticed the apparently strange coincidence that the coastline of West Africa and the eastern coastline of South America seemed to fit together like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Despite the prevailing opinion at the time, that the enormous land masses of the continents were just too big to move, Wegener proposed the only theory that reconciled his observations. Continental drift suggested that the land masses weren't rooted in place but could, ever-so-slowly, change their relative positions on the surface of the Earth.\nMore like this:\u00a0\nWhen Wegener published his theory in 1915, he became a laughing stock. Geologists rejected his outlandish idea, citing a lack of mechanism for moving such enormous chunks of the Earth's surface, dismissing the seemingly snug tessellation of the continents as pure coincidence. By the 1960s, however, the theory of plate tectonics \u2013 the movement of the solid mantle and crust over the Earth's surface \u2013 gave credence to Wegener's now widely accepted theories.\nAlthough coincidences can point the way to new scientific discoveries, they can also prove an obstacle to scientific progress when they appear to confirm an incorrect theory. In the early 1800s German anatomist Johann Friedrich Meckel made just such a blunder. He was a believer in scala naturae (the ladder of nature) in which humans sit above all other animals in an ordered but static hierarchy. The simplest, most primitive life forms were supposed to sit on the lowest rungs of the ladder, while the most complex and advanced beings resided on the highest. His views were hardly surprising given that this \"great chain of being\" was the predominant theory of the day. The now generally accepted theory of \"common descent\" \u2013 that multiple species descend from a single ancestral population \u2013 was only in its infancy as an idea at the time.\nMeckel employed scala naturae to come up with a conjecture about his area of speciality \u2013 embryonic development. Known as recapitulation theory, he posited that, as they developed, the embryos of higher order animals (like mammals) progressed successively through forms which strongly resembled the \"less perfect\" animals, like fish, amphibians and reptiles, on lower rungs of the ladder. One startling, but seemingly unlikely prediction of this theory was that, as humans progressed through the \"fish stage\", their embryos would have gill slits.\nAs it happens, it was discovered in 1827 that human embryos really do have slits that resemble gills at an early stage of development. This extraordinary finding seemed to bear out Meckel's prediction and corroborate his recapitulation theory. So strong was the perceived evidence that the theory became widely accepted, and it wasn't until almost 50 years later in the 1870s that the recapitulation theory of development was finally put to bed for good as the idea of common descent started to take hold. Common descent underpins what we now know as modern evolutionary theory. It made clear that, far from undergoing a \"fish stage\" in the womb, the gill slits were a consequence of the fact that, sharing a common ancestor with fish, we also share much of their DNA and early developmental processes.\nSometimes coincidences can lead scientists astray, seeming to point to one conclusion when, in fact, there is an alternative explanation for the observations that is better supported by the facts.\nSo what does the fact that the beautiful, almost mystical Fibonacci sequence has cropped up in the data on the number of Premier League title wins mean for the beautiful game? With no plausible mechanism which could have given rise to the sequence, the answer is almost certainly nothing.\nIt's wonderful to have spotted this mathematical sequence in such an unlikely place, giving us a chance to reflect upon the importance of Fibonacci numbers. But a pattern doesn't always mean causality \u2013 a coincidence is sometimes just a coincidence.\nAnd, just like Meckel's gill slits, its appearance in the Premier League records is just that \u2013 nothing more than a spectacular but ultimately misleading coincidence.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.\nThe main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.\nLast Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.\nIn the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.\nThere is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations. \nWhile violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.\nTourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.\nAt a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.\nOther tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.\nAfter a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.\nAmong those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".\n\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.\nBut uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.\nIndian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.\nIndia and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.\nThe escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.\nIndian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.\nTop leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.\n\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.\nThe cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.\n\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"\nThe attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.\nThe timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.\nThe region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.\n\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.\nAs the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.\nIn an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.\nHe said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.\n\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?\n\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.",

        "article_text": "Within hours of taking his second oath of office, Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders and declarations, and fired the starting gun on what has been a rapid and radical programme of change in his first 100 days.\nSo far, he has shown no sign of taking his foot off the pedal.\nThe sheer quantity of his news-generating actions over the past few months could be seen as a carefully considered strategy. It is one that Steve Bannon, the right-wing podcast host who advised Trump during his first term, first floated as long ago as 2018.\n\"The Democrats don't matter,\" Bannon told the writer Michael Lewis at the time. \"The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone.\"\nSo seven years on, with Trump back in the Oval Office and the zone not just flooded but virtually submerged, does Bannon think the strategy has worked?\n\"Flooding the Zone' is an overwhelming success,\" he tells me via text. \"The biggest victory is a broken globalist media that finds itself too frayed to cover our assault on the institutions of America's oppression.\"\nIt is a typically bombastic response. A wide variety of opinion polls, however, suggest the public is less enthusiastic. Trump's overall approval rating at this stage of his presidency, for example, is the lowest of any president in the past 80 years, according to a joint ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released on the weekend.\nIn his usual fashion, Trump hit out at \"fake polls from fake news organisations\".\nBut do they suggest ailing support that could pose a problem for him down the line?\nIt is still early, of course, and Trump's base remains fully committed. Even so, the best laid plans of even the most cautious politicians can go awry. So after 100 days of action, is there anything that could derail Trump's promised agenda in the coming months?\nHere are three potential scenarios.\nTrump has spent many years talking about the good that tariffs could do for America's economy \u2013 and now he is trying to make it a reality.\nBut staking your presidency on a policy of global economic disruption comes with significant risks.\nTrump has already reacted to tanking global markets by announcing tariff pauses, and he has signalled he is ready to make a deal with China by recently making warmer comments than the earlier angry barbs aimed at Beijing.\nBut in July, steep tariffs on imports from any countries that do not have a trade deal with the US are set to come into force.\nCan the administration really agree 90 trade deals in 90 days as Trump has promised? If not, the president may find that his tariff regime and the potential for more market chaos begins to further shake his standing with voters.\nVoters who backed the president in November, at least many I have spoken to, appreciate the White House message that he is standing up to countries that have for decades taken advantage of the US and seeking to inject fresh life into American manufacturing.\nBut there is a tension between this message and what plays out on the ground -  not in diplomatic talks between leaders, but on main streets and in supermarkets as Americans go about their daily lives.\nTrump's tariff plans have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. And a poll by CBS News on Monday indicated there is a growing belief among voters that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices.\nThis feels key to the success of the Trump administration in coming months. Ambitions to reset the global trading order are one thing - and a popular one among the president's supporters at that - but handing the cost of this to the average American consumer by increasing taxes on virtually all imports is dangerous politically, even more so if the country were to tip into recession.\nImmigration has always been Trump's signature issue. He enjoys higher approval ratings on it than any other policy area, with polls suggesting a significant number of voters support his swift actions to deport thousands of undocumented migrants.\nAs the administration pursues this immigration crackdown, it may not be the views of voters that hamper Trump, but rulings from the nation's courts. Judges are repeatedly telling the White House that its actions may be in breach of the law.\nThe case of one man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, has already made it to the Supreme Court. The administration has admitted it made a mistake when deporting him to a notorious prison in El Salvador, but appears unwilling to follow a Supreme Court order to \"facilitate\" his return to the US.\nSo far, the White House has avoided the kind of clash with judges that could prompt a full-blown constitutional crisis, even as it has maneuvered around court rulings aimed at limiting some of its most radical policy moves. But a showdown may happen soon.\nThe ultimate confrontation, of course, would come if Trump chose to ignore an order from the Supreme Court.\nUntil now the administration has been happy to argue about deportations in the court of public opinion, convinced that voters are much more concerned about removing illegal immigrants from the country than they are about due process.\nMike Madrid, a Republican political consultant, agrees. He told me that, in his view, many people do not believe undocumented migrants deserve legal rights. \n\"If you frame it between giving them due process and getting terrorist gang members... Republicans are going to side with getting MS-13 members off the streets,\" he said.\nStill, public support for Trump's immigration moves could be slipping. A poll published late last week indicated his approval rating on the issue had fallen by 10 points in recent weeks.\nEven if voters are prepared to accept the White House ignoring court rulings, any such move could pose a significant challenge to many Republican members of Congress who feel squeamish about it. So far, the party's senators and representatives have virtually given Trump free rein to do whatever he likes. But could they remain silent when faced with a president defying the law?\nElon Musk and his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" have not wasted a minute of these 100 days, taking their chainsaw to large parts of the federal workforce and cutting government spending including on international aid.\nAs with much of Trump's agenda, there is a tension between the very real voter sympathy for the message - in this case, that the government is bloated, wasteful and inefficient - versus the extreme actions sometimes taken by the White House to address that message.\nAnd with DOGE, the political risk for the president could come if it begins to cut government spending and programmes that voters readily rely on. That is a real risk, as the anger at Musk is already bubbling up.\nMany elected Republicans have stopped holding open meetings for constituents, known as town halls, after being confronted by angry voters who are worried about cuts to their pensions or government-funded healthcare. \nTensions are also running high within Trump's cabinet over Musk's interference, culminating in a heated shouting match in the West Wing recently between the billionaire adviser and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nThe reality is that Musk is considerably less popular than Trump, and his expensive effort to influence a special election in Wisconsin fell completely flat with voters.\nThe tech billionaire will soon have to leave the president's side. He is under pressure from Tesla shareholders to return to his struggling car company, and as a \"special government employee\" he faces time limits on working within this administration. There is a world in which less-frequent appearances at the White House could prove to be in the best interests of Trump.\nBut while Musk may be leaving, DOGE is expected to continue its work until July 2026. That leaves plenty of opportunities for it to make deeply unpopular spending cuts, which is undoubtedly a longer-term political risk for this White House, especially ahead of next year's mid-term elections.\nFor now, however, Trump's 100-day blitz of orders, actions and noise has steamrolled opposition and proved popular with his loyal base, who say he is simply doing what he promised. \nThose risks, however, are there - and with an administration as unpredictable and fast-moving as this one, the potential for a crisis never truly goes away.",

So after 100 days of action, is there anything that could derail Trump's promised agenda in the coming months?Here are three potential scenarios.Tariff dream turns to recession nightmareTrump has spent many years talking about the good that tariffs could do for America's economy \u2013 and now he is trying to make it a reality.But staking your presidency on a policy of global economic disruption comes with significant risks.Trump has already reacted to tanking global markets by announcing tariff pauses, and he has signalled he is ready to make a deal with China by recently making warmer comments than the earlier angry barbs aimed at Beijing.But in July, steep tariffs on imports from any countries that do not have a trade deal with the US are set to come into force.Can the administration really agree 90 trade deals in 90 days as Trump has promised? The administration has admitted it made a mistake when deporting him to a notorious prison in El Salvador, but appears unwilling to follow a Supreme Court order to \"facilitate\" his return to the US.So far, the White House has avoided the kind of clash with judges that could prompt a full-blown constitutional crisis, even as it has maneuvered around court rulings aimed at limiting some of its most radical policy moves. He enjoys higher approval ratings on it than any other policy area, with polls suggesting a significant number of voters support his swift actions to deport thousands of undocumented migrants.As the administration pursues this immigration crackdown, it may not be the views of voters that hamper Trump, but rulings from the nation's courts.",

Kill your local MP\".\nA spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he did not think \"individuals expressing those views should be receiving government funding\".\nKneecap have said on social media that they have \"faced a co-ordinated smear campaign\".\nThe footage is being assessed by counter-terrorism police and Badenoch has called for prosecution.\nThe Metropolitan Police said they are assessing that and another video, from November last year, where the footage appeared to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\" at a performance in London.\nThe Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Mich\u00e1el Martin called on the trio to \"urgently clarify\" the comments.\nBoth Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\nNone of the members of Kneecap has been charged with any offences.\nIn Dublin on Monday the taoiseach said: \"Have they, or do they, support Hamas and Hezbollah, because that would be unacceptable.\n\"I mean Hezbollah are responsible, in my view, for the murder of Sean Rooney. \n\"And both Hamas and Hezbollah have views that are absolutely... not just views, but participated in terrorist activities and appalling killing of innocent people, as witnessed on October the 7th. \n\"But it's not clear to me that they do, that Kneecap does support Hezbollah and Hamas. It's been asserted that they have made commentary in support of both.

That's all legitimate. But in terms of life and security and safety of people, that's a different issue,\" he added.\nLast year, Kneecap won a discrimination case against the UK government after Badenoch withdrew arts funding for the band, in a move which was deemed \"unlawful\".  \nKneecap was awarded \u00a314,250 - the same amount they were initially granted.\nBadenoch, speaking on a local election campaigning visit to Lincolnshire, said the statement was \"disgusting \"and the band \"should be prosecuted\" and that \"people are in prison for sending tweets that don't go that far\".\nShe said they \"should not be glorifying terrorism\" and are \"anti-British\".\nNorthern Ireland's Economy Minister Caoimhe Archibald told BBC News NI that she did not agree with what was said, but that Kneecap is \"group that have been very vocal on issues that are important to them like Gaza\".\n\"I think the most outrageous issue facing the world today is the ongoing genocide that we are seeing in Palestine and the bombardment that continues on a daily basis, the blockading of aid, the slaughter of innocent women and children and I think that's what our focus should be on as an international community in bringing an end to that,\" she added. \nDUP leader Gavin Robinson said Kneecap had become a \"hatefest\".\nThe East Belfast MP said the band's position was \"appalling and outrageous\" and said there was a collective political will in London and Dublin to \"call out\" their comments.\n\"These gentlemen don't need to be on a stage they need to be in a courtroom because it is a hate crime what they are doing,\" he added.\nThe Alliance MLA, Sian Mulholland, said that Kneecap's alleged comments \"crosses a line from art as a tool of protest and into incitement\".\nShe described the rap group's political views on the conflict in Gaza as \"valid\" however, Mulholland said the band's views were being \"undermined and overshadowed\" by the group's actions.\nThe First Minister of Scotland, John Swinney, has backed calls for Kneecap to be axed from Glasgow's TRNSMT music festival this summer.\nSpeaking at the Scottish Trades Union Congress in Dundee, John Swinney said the band's alleged comments had \"crossed a line\" and were \"beyond the pale\".\nThere has also been a call by two MPs for the group to be removed from the Glastonbury Festival line-up in June.\nIn a letter to Sir Michael Eavis, a co-creator of the festival, Labour MP David Taylor said it would be \"deeply troubling\" to see the band performing at the event.\nNorth Antrim MP and leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) Jim Allister has written to organisers of the Glastonbury Festival asking them to drop Kneecap from the festival. \nHe said that it was \"wholly unacceptable for a mainstream, UK-wide cultural event to be seen to endorse \u2014 even by implication \u2014 messages of political violence and terror glorification\".\nThe band are listed to play on the Saturday of this year's festival.\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"As the broadcast partner, the BBC will be bringing audiences extensive music coverage from Glastonbury, with artists booked by the festival organisers.\"\n\"The Glastonbury broadcast plans will be considered in the coming weeks, and all output will adhere to our editorial guidelines,\" they added. \nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for a German concert promoter and event producer, FKP GmbH, said Kneecap \"will not be performing at Hurricane or Southside festival this year\" in the country.\nOn Monday, the daughter of a Conservative MP who was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery said the rap group should apologise.\nKatie Amess, whose father Sir David Amess was an MP when he was murdered in 2021, said she was \"gobsmacked at the stupidity of somebody or a group of people being in the public eye and saying such dangerous, violent rhetoric\".\nMs Amess said she would be prepared to meet Kneecap and have a conversation with them.\n\"If they are willing to listen to how my life has been obliterated and will never be the same, for them to say those words is obviously very triggering,\" she said.\nLast week, TV personality Sharon Osbourne said the group should have their United States work visas revoked after they ended their set at Coachella, an annual music festival in California, with pro-Palestinian messages.\nMs Osbourne said that Kneecap \"took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements\".\nWhen asked by BBC News NI for response, the band said: \"Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.\"",

        "article_text": "After great reviews and buzz, Ryan Coogler's vampire film had an extraordinary second weekend at the box office. It's a victory for a wholly original big-budget film in a cinema landscape dominated by familiar franchises.\nIn less than a fortnight since it was released, Sinners has already made more money at the US box office than Disney's Snow White. Could Ryan Coogler's vampire film go on to overtake two more of this year's Disney hits, Mufasa: The Lion King and Captain America: Brave New World? It's definitely possible. The Hollywood Reporter calls Sinners a \"rule-defying\" proposition that \"continues to defy all the odds\", because it was almost as lucrative in its second weekend in US cinemas as it was in its first, earning $45m (\u00a334m) against its opening $48m (\u00a336m). \"Put another way, Sinners boasts the smallest second-weekend decline for any film opening north of $40m since 2009's Avatar and the smallest ever for an R-rated horror title,\" says the article. Meanwhile The Wrap predicts that it will be \"the highest-grossing original live-action film in the US since Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity in 2013\". Its current worldwide box office total stands at $161m (\u00a3120m), against a $90m (\u00a367m) budget, and it likely has a long distance left to run. Sinners is a winner \u2013 just a week after a sceptical article by Variety sniffed that \"profitability remains a question mark\".\nPerhaps this shouldn't come as a shock. The director of Creed and the Black Panther films, Coogler is adept at taking familiar Hollywood genres (sports drama, superhero blockbuster) and putting his own distinctive-yet-crowd-pleasing stamp on them. But he has gone a step further than usual this time. Featuring Michael B Jordan as a pair of twins defending their juke joint from vampires, Sinners is a horror film \u2013 but it's also a blues musical, a gangster thriller and a deeply-researched period drama about Mississippi in the 1930s. It doesn't stick to the rules of one particular genre, and it isn't based on existing intellectual property (IP), so audiences don't come to it knowing how it's all going to play out. Thanks also to some carefully-vague trailers, viewers get to discover the story for themselves \u2013 which is an increasingly rare treat. Reviewing a new Hollywood film often comes down to answering one question: \"Is it slightly better or slightly worse than every other Marvel/ DC/ Star Wars/ Alien /Jurassic World/ King Kong film I've seen?\" But Sinners is idiosyncratic enough to prompt other questions, which may explain its box office momentum, as word-of-mouth has spread.\nThis unorthodox quality is a sign of the freedom that Coogler felt when he was making it. All of his previous films were adapted from other material \u2013 or from true events, in the case of his debut, Fruitvale Station \u2013 but he told The Atlantic that with Sinners, he didn't want to use IP as \"something to hide behind\". He wanted to make the most personal film he could \u2013 a \"love letter\" to a late uncle from Mississippi \u2013 and that meant a film which didn't follow conventions.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 of the best films of 2025 so far\n\u2022\u00a0The best films to watch in April\n\u2022\u00a0Warfare review: it 'does what film does best'\nIn some ways it could be filed alongside two other films with \"must-see\" and \"must-talk-about\" appeal, 2024's The Substance and 2023's Saltburn. Sinners is a far bigger commercial success than they were, but each offer transgressive, sexually charged, gore-smeared excitement, none of them is based on a superhero comic, a video game or an earlier film, and each expresses the vision of a writer-director being allowed to do their own thing. (And their titles all begin with S, but that could be a coincidence.) The fact that it is so tricky to say which genre they belong to is a key factor. Is The Substance primarily a body-horror film or a Hollywood satire? Is Saltburn a crime thriller or a class comedy? All of these films stir different ingredients together to cook something unexpected. As Coogler put it to The Atlantic: \"I wanted it to feel like you were reading Salem's Lot while listening to the best blues record, eating a bowl of spicy gumbo.\"\nThat could be why, anecdotes suggest, many people are already paying to see Sinners more than once. Because it isn't a generic, IP-based exercise, they know that they're going to discover more on a second viewing. And they know that they're going to have a good time while they're doing it. Maybe if they go for third and fourth viewings, too, Hollywood might decide that original, auteur-driven, big-budget films shouldn't be quite as rare in the cinema landscape as they are today.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "One of Prince Andrew's prized business assets was administered for two years by a company controlled by the controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman, the BBC can reveal. \nAfter the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK).\nBarrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers.\nA lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".\nPitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\". \nDocuments filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.\nPrince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles.\nThe prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy.\nMr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful.\nMr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined \u00a3150,000 in 2022.\nIn January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company. \nThe National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing.\nAuthor Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"\nPitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts:\nBoth arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal.\nNonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\".\nEarlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations. \nHowever, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name.\nFounded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family.\nBut early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited.\nThis company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it. \nCorporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman. \nIn 2023, ownership of Knox House Trustees (UK) Ltd \u2013 which still owned Pitch@Palace Global - was transferred to Arthur Lancaster, an accountant who has a longstanding working relationship with both the prince and Mr Barrowman. This remains the situation today.\nThe same year Mr Lancaster took over as the sole director and shareholder of PPE Medpro.

After the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK).Barrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers.A lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".Pitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control.

However, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name.Founded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family.But early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited.This company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it. Documents filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.Controversial associatesPrince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles.The prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Laura read this article\n\nIf you say the name Donald Trump in the halls of wholesale markets and trade fairs in China, you'll hear a faint chuckle.\nThe US president and his 145% tariffs have not instilled fear in many Chinese traders.\nInstead, they have inspired an army of online Chinese nationalists to create mocking memes in a series of viral videos and reels \u2013 some of which include an AI-generated President Trump, Vice-President JD Vance and tech mogul Elon Musk toiling on footwear and iPhone assembly lines.\nChina is not behaving like a nation facing the prospect of economic pain and President Xi Jinping has made it clear that Beijing will not back down.\n\"For more than 70 years, China has always relied on self-reliance and hard work for development\u2026 it has never relied on anyone's gifts and is unafraid of any unreasonable suppression,\" he said this month.\nHis confidence may come in part because China is far less dependent than it was 10 years ago on exports to the US. But the truth is Trump's brinkmanship and tariff hikes are pushing on pressure points that already exist within China's own struggling economy. With a housing crisis, increasing job insecurity and an ageing population, Chinese people are simply not spending as much as their government would like.\nXi came to power in 2012 with a dream of a rejuvenated China. That is now being severely tested \u2013 and not just by US tariffs. Now, the question is whether or not Trump's tariffs will dampen Xi's economic dreams, or can he turn the obstacles that exist into opportunities?\nWith a population of 1.4 billion, China has, in theory, a huge domestic market. But there's a problem. They don't appear willing to spend money while the country's economic outlook is uncertain.\nThis has not been prompted by the trade war \u2013 but by the collapse of the housing market. Many Chinese families invested their life savings in their homes, only to watch prices plummet in the last five years.\nHousing developers continued to build even as the property market crumbled. It's thought that China's entire population would not fill all the empty apartments across the country.\nThe former deputy head of China's statistics bureau, He Keng, admitted two years ago that the most \"extreme estimate\" is that there are now enough vacant homes for 3 billion people.\nTravel round Chinese provinces and you see they are littered with empty projects \u2013 lines of towering concrete shells that have been labelled \"ghost cities\". Others have been fitted out, the gardens have been landscaped, curtains frame the windows, and they appear filled with the promise of a new home. But only at night, when you see no lights, can you tell that the apartments are empty. There just aren't enough buyers to match this level of construction.\nThe government acted five years ago to restrict the amount of money developers could borrow. But the damage to house prices and, in turn, consumer confidence in China, has been done and analysts have projected a 2.5% decline in home prices this year, according to a Reuters poll in February.\nAnd it's not just house prices that worry middle-class Chinese families.\nThey are concerned about whether the government can offer them a pension \u2013 over the next decade, about 300 million people, who are currently aged 50 to 60, are set to leave the Chinese workforce. According to a 2019 estimate by the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the government pension fund could run out of money by 2035.\nThere are also fears about whether their sons, daughters and grandchildren can get a job as millions of college graduates are struggling to find work. More than one in five people between the ages of 16 and 24 in urban areas are jobless in China, according to official data published in August 2023. The government has not released youth unemployment figures since then.\nThe problem is that China cannot simply flip a switch and move from selling goods to the US to selling them to local buyers.\n\"Given the downward pressure on the economy, it is unlikely domestic spending can be significantly expanded in the short term,\" says Prof Nie Huihua at Renmin University.\n\"Replacing exports with internal demand will take time.\"\nAccording to Prof Zhao Minghao, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, \"China does not have high expectations for talks with the Trump administration\u2026 The real battleground is in the adjustment of China's domestic policies, such as boosting domestic demand.\"\nTo revive a slowing economy, the government has announced billions in childcare subsidies, increased wages and better paid leave. It has also introduced a $41bn programme offering discounts on items such as consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) to encourage more people to spend. But Prof Zhang Jun, the Dean of Economics at Fudan University, believes this is not \"sustainable\".\n\"We need a long-term mechanism,\" he says. \"We need to start increasing residents' disposable income.\"\nThis is urgent for Xi. The dream of prosperity he sold when he took power 13 years ago has not become reality.\nXi is also aware that China has a disheartened younger generation worried about their future. That could spell bigger trouble for the Communist Party: protests or unrest.\nA report by Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor claims that protests driven by financial grievances saw a steep increase in the last few months.\nAll protests are quickly subdued and censored on social media, so it is unlikely to pose a real threat to Xi for now.\n\"Only when the country does well and the nation does well can every person do well,\" Xi said in 2012.\nThis promise was made when China's economic rise looked unstoppable. It now looks uncertain.\nWhere the country has made huge strides over the past decade is in areas such as consumer electronics, batteries, EVs and artificial intelligence as part of a pivot to advanced manufacturing.\nIt has rivalled US tech dominance with the chatbot DeepSeek and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest EV maker.\nYet Trump's tariffs threaten to throw a spanner in the works.\nThe restrictions on the sale of key chips to China, including the most recent move tightening exports from US chip giant Nvidia, for instance, are aimed at curbing Xi's ambitions for tech supremacy.\nDespite that, Xi knows that Chinese manufacturers are at a decades-long advantage, so that US manufacturers are struggling to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.\nPresident Xi is also trying to use this crisis as a catalyst for further change and to find more new markets for China.\n\"In the short term, some Chinese exporters will be greatly impacted,\" says Prof Zhang. \"But Chinese companies will take the initiative to adjust the destination of exports to overcome difficulties. Exporters are waiting and looking for new customers.\"\nDonald Trump's first term in office was China's cue to look elsewhere for buyers. It has expanded its ties across South East Asia, Latin America and Africa \u2013 and a Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative shored up ties with the so-called Global South.\nChina is reaping the rewards from that diversification. More than 145 countries do more trade with China than they do with the US, according to the Lowy Institute.\nIn 2001, only 30 countries chose Beijing as their lead trade partner over Washington.\nAs Trump targets both friend and foe, some believe Xi can further upend the current US-led world order and portray his country as a stable, alternative global trade partner and leader.\nThe Chinese leader chose South East Asia for his first trip abroad after the tariff announcement, sensing his neighbours would be getting jittery about Trump's tariffs.\nAround a quarter of Chinese exports are now manufactured or shipped through a second country including Vietnam and Cambodia.\nRecent US actions may also present a chance for Xi to positively shape China's role in the world.\n\"Trump's coercive tariff policy is an opportunity for Chinese diplomacy,\" says Prof Zhang.\nChina will have to tread carefully. Some countries will be nervous that products being manufactured for the US could end up flooding into their markets.\nTrump's tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers.\nAccording to Prof Huihua, \"about 20% of China's exports go to the US - if these exports were to flood any regional market or country, it could lead to dumping and vicious competition, thereby triggering new trade frictions\".\nThere are barriers to Xi presenting himself as the arbiter of free trade in the world.\nChina has subjected other nations to trade restrictions in recent years.\nIn 2020, after the Australian government called for a global inquiry into the origins and early handling of the Covid pandemic, which Beijing argued was a political manoeuvre against them, China placed tariffs on Australian wine and barley and imposed biosecurity measures on some beef and timber and bans on coal, cotton and lobster. Some Australian exports of certain goods to China fell to nearly zero.\nAustralia's Defence Minister Richard Marles said earlier this month that his nation will not be \"holding China's hand\" as Washington escalated its trade war with Beijing.\nChina's past actions may impede Xi's current global outreach and many countries may be unwilling to choose between Beijing and Washington.\nEven with all the various difficulties, Xi is betting that Beijing will be able to withstand any economic pain longer than Washington in this great power competition.\nAnd it does appear that Trump has blinked first, last week hinting at a potential U-turn on tariffs, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nMeanwhile, Chinese social media is back in action.\n\"Trump has chickened out,\" was one of the top trending search topics on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after the US president softened his approach to tariffs.\nEven if or when talks do happen, China is playing a longer game.\nThe last trade war forced it to diversify its export market away from the US towards other markets \u2013 especially in the Global South.\nThis trade war has China looking in the mirror to see its own flaws \u2013 and whether it can fix them will be up to policies made in Beijing, not Washington.\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Mark Wood is hoping to be fit to play in England's five-Test series against India this summer\nPace bowler Mark Wood is irritated by a \"golf, golf, golf\" narrative around the England team, but admits they do not help themselves by saying \"dumb\" things in the media.\nA number of England's players have made no secret of their love of golf, leading to accusations they do not train enough, particularly from former captain Kevin Pietersen during the white-ball tour of India earlier this year.\nThe perception has not been helped by comments made to the press by some members of the squad, leading to managing director Rob Key saying in March they need to \"stop talking rubbish\".\nSpeaking on the Sky Sports Cricket Podcast, Wood said: \"Sometimes we've been so, how can I say this? Naive, a bit dumb in the things we say in the press.\n\"We'll say things in the dressing room and that is in the dressing room. It should stay there. Then we come out in the press and we'll say an off-the-cuff one-liner that maybe a group of lads have been talking about, then it's in the press, then it looks like we're Billy Big Boots, above our station. I don't particularly like that. We've got to be respectful.\"\nWood, 35, did not give specific examples and said: \"I'm not kicking off at the other players.\"\nPietersen's comments on training came during a tour of India when England lost a T20 series 4-1 and the one-day internationals 3-0 and, speaking to The Telegraph earlier this month, he said: \"I stand by every word.\"\nWithout referring to Pietersen specifically, Wood said: \"One thing that does bother me is this narrative of 'golf, golf, golf'.\n\"I don't play golf. I don't like it. It's not a game for me. I know the lads enjoy it and that's their time off. At times it's as if the golf is more important, and that is not true at all.\n\"I cannot stress enough that when we're at training, especially under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, we train hard.\n\"The lads don't take it for granted that we play for England. This narrative of \"oh, well, we'll play golf, this is the best gig in the world\", I can understand people's frustration with it, but I'm telling you, people genuinely care and work hard.\n\"I'm there to win for England.

Then we come out in the press and we'll say an off-the-cuff one-liner that maybe a group of lads have been talking about, then it's in the press, then it looks like we're Billy Big Boots, above our station.",

He is likely to be joined in the squad by Matthew Potts (10 caps), Josh Tongue (two) and uncapped Essex man Sam Cook.\nA combination in the XI of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook would have 13 caps between them. Not since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago has England's pace attack looked so callow at home, when Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Richard Johnson had a combined seven caps.\nIndeed, England have played only one home Test without any of Woakes, Anderson or Stuart Broad in the past 18 years.\nAlthough Zimbabwe are improving \u2013 they have just earned a creditable 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh \u2013 England will be overwhelming favourites to win the four-day Test when it begins on 22 May.\nFollowing that, the five-match series at home to India and the Ashes away in Australia this winter will shape the leadership legacies of Stokes, coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.\n'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nWe've said naive things, but we do care - Wood\nWoakes has not played yet this season because of an ankle problem, while Wood is out until July following knee surgery.\nBrydon Carse remains sidelined with a foot problem and Olly Stone will not play before the back end of the summer after his own knee operation. Ollie Robinson, who has won 20 Test caps, has not played for England in more than a year and lost his central contract in October.\nAll-rounder Stokes, with 210 Test wickets, has more scalps than any other active England bowler, though his bowling is likely to be restricted. An injury sustained in the third Test against New Zealand in December was the second time in five months the talismanic captain had hurt his left hamstring.\nStokes will look to build his bowling in the run-up to the India series, when England will hope to have Woakes and Carse available. Jofra Archer could play his first red-ball game in four years for England Lions against India A in June. Speaking on Wednesday, Wood did not rule out a return for the conclusion of the India series.\nFor now, Atkinson will lead the attack following his stunning debut year in Test cricket while Potts played in England's last Test in New Zealand.\nTongue has not played for England for two years because of injuries but has enjoyed a superb start to the season with Nottinghamshire.\nCook, 27, has been the outstanding bowler in domestic cricket for some time, grabbing 318 first-class wickets at an average under 20.\nHe is not blessed with high pace and has had to wait for his chance, yet an indication an England call-up was on the horizon came when it was requested he be rested from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire last month.\nIf England feel they want further pace cover in the squad, it could come from 20-year-old left-armer Josh Hull, who made his Test debut last summer, or Hampshire's exciting prospect Sonny Baker. Baker has played only three first-class matches but was given an England development contract in February.\nOther areas of selection look more straightforward. Jamie Smith will return behind the stumps after missing the tour of New Zealand on paternity leave, while there is no suggestion Shoaib Bashir's place as the number one spinner is under threat.\nAny decisions over the top five will be delayed by Jacob Bethell's stint at the Indian Premier League.

An outage caused by a faulty software or server update, or even user error, can often be resolved in a matter of hours.\nBut trying to find and stop malware sweeping through systems and causing havoc on the scale of those operated by a large nationwide retailer like M&S, is not a quick job says Professor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert from Surrey University.\n\"Everything from knowing what has been sold, hence what needs replenishing, to taking card payments is very dependent on complex systems\u2026 it will take significant time and expertise to analyse and ensure they have expelled the hacker,\" he said.\nLisa Forte, partner at cyber security firm Red Goat, agrees.\n\"They are handling the disruption in a mature way but to expect any company to get anything back online in a week is never going to happen,\" she says.\n \"I don't know one organisation that could do it.\"\nA lot is also riding on the nature of the threat. The longer a cyber incident goes on, the more likely it is to be ransomware, say multiple cybersecurity experts.\n\"I would suggest there is a high level of confidence this is a ransomware style event,\" says Dan Card, cyber expert at BCS, the chartered institute for IT.\n\"I describe these as like a digital bomb has gone off. So recovering from them is often both technically and logistically challenging\u2026 the victim organisation is likely going to be working around the clock to respond and recover.\"\nRansomware is a particularly nasty strain of malware, in which the owner of a computer or network of computers is locked out, their data scrambled, and the attackers demand a fee, usually in cryptocurrency, to restore it.\nOfficial advice is not to pay. You are, after all, putting your trust in criminals to be true to their word. \nBut it is often impossible to restore compromised services without the hackers' key \u2013 meaning the only way around it is to either use back-ups or install new systems and start again.\nM&S will not comment, and no attacker has yet gone public with any demands \u2013 although this doesn't always happen, it is often a way for cyber criminals to pile more pressure onto their victims.\nDragonForce, the cyber criminal gang we were told on Tuesday was likely to be behind the attack, allow other hackers to use their malicious software for attacks providing they get a cut.\nAs to who those hackers might be: fingers are pointing at a rather fluid network of individuals called Scattered Spider (it also has other aliases).\nIt was behind the attack on the MGM Las Vegas hotels in 2023.\nThe website Bleeping Computer cites \"multiple sources\" suggesting they are responsible and says some of them are teenagers.\nRik Ferguson, special advisor to Europol's European Cyber Crime Centre, says the sources of speculation about the group's involvement seem credible but adds that he has seen no conclusive evidence so far.\nI asked him whether M&S customers should be concerned about their personal information: the firm itself currently says no action is required.\n\"Only M&S are able to tell us whether customers should be worried about their personal data,\" he said.\n\"In the absence of certainty, it would certainly be advisable for M&S customers, particularly those who may have reused their M&S account credentials on other web services, to begin changing those passwords elsewhere.\"",

It looks like Fifa career mode.\"\nAnother claimed: \"I think this may be the most commonly agreed worst tifo of all time given the circumstances.\"\nWhile a third said: \"Arsenal turned down the fans' tifo design request to produce this monstrosity. Champions League semi-final and this was the best they could come up with? So disappointed.\"\nAccording to former England striker Wayne Rooney, working as a TV pundit, the atmosphere at the Emirates on Tuesday was in contrast to the Real Madrid game.\nBefore that match, supporters in each block of the stadium held up red and white cards above their heads.\n\"For Arsenal, I was a bit disappointed with how they played, disappointed with the fans as well,\" Rooney told Amazon Prime.\n\"I thought tonight they were a bit subdued, almost like an anti-climax that they beat Real Madrid and were going to walk into the final and win the competition.\"\nThis video can not be played\nArteta reacts to defeat against PSG in Champions League semi-final\nWhy Arsenal can still reach Champions League final\nArsenal fan writer Laura Kirk: \"One of the fan groups Ashburton Army had raised some money for a tifo which was ultimately rejected by the club, I imagine because the designs were not in keeping with the club's brand but the club haven't actually said anything. \n\"In comparison with what we see elsewhere in Europe, like the one Real Madrid had against us last week, it just felt like a massively missed opportunity to do something amazing.\"\nOli Price-Bates from The Fresh Arsenal Podcast: \"The tifo from the club was certainly a bit underwhelming. The occasion deserved more from the club to help with the atmosphere and fan engagement. \n\"Certainly if Arsenal get to this stage again, they need to be better prepared and involve the fans in the process, not just in tifos but the wider experience and build-up for the match. \n\"Hopefully we won't wait so long for another semi-final and the club will be better prepared to make more impact.\"\nBroadcaster and Arsenal fan Harry Symeou: \"I think the fans were hoping to see something with a bit more of a wow factor. Given there was lots of talk online with regards to some more elaborate, striking designs - you can understand why some felt underwhelmed.\n\"Tifos on the continent tend to be more creative and really can set the scene ahead of a huge occasion. Fan groups, in particular those known as 'ultras' normally have a big input - leading to a higher rate of fan satisfaction. But this is something we don't do well enough in English football generally. If as a club, you're going to take it upon yourselves to both plan and execute such displays, you've got to deliver something with far more imagination than that.\"\nCrystal Palace's tifo prior to their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa.\nManchester United's tifo prior to their Europa League fixture against Lyon.\nAston Villa's tifo prior to their Champions League tie with Paris St-Germain.\n1 of 3\nOn the whole?

The venue invites artists and communities to reimagine its 18th Century facade, and its exhibitions have also explored the legacies of the likes of Capability Brown, Louise Bourgeois and Chila Kumari Singh Burman.More than 6,000 schoolchildren have visited and participated in early creative projects, while recent initiatives have also included a monthly dementia caf\u00e9 and an upcoming large-scale multimedia exhibition of work, reflecting on life and death, by Emma Talbot (5 July-5 October).The jury noted the museum's commitment to \"breaking down barriers to cultural careers for young people with disabilities.",

She said she was \"relieved\" that Mr Mahdawi had been released, and vowed to \"keep fighting until Mohsen is free for good\". \nMr Mahdawi thanked supporters outside the courtroom, saying, \"We are pro-peace and anti-war\". \n\"To my people in Palestine: I feel your pain, I see your suffering; and I see freedom and it is very very soon.\"\nOne day before his arrest, Mr Mahdawi had told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he believed the citizenship interview could be a setup.\n\"It's the first feeling of like, I've been waiting for this for more than a year,\" Mr Mahdawi said. \"And the other feeling is like, wait a minute.

        "article_text": "As Mark Carney settles into the role of Canada's prime minister, he will not only have to take on US President Donald Trump, but also wider divisions within his own country.\nAmong those is a generational divide, with young voters who are concerned about housing unaffordability, crime and the cost of living coalescing around the Conservatives. \nIt's a reversal from 2015, when youth voted in record numbers, helping sweep Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau to power. \nBut this election, \"baby boomers\" - those over the age of 60 - \"were an essential component to the Liberal success\", pollster David Coletto of Abacus Data told the BBC.\nMeanwhile, younger Canadians, particularly young men, rallied behind the Conservatives.\nOne of them is Connor from Toronto. The 28-year-old told the BBC that he was drawn to the party because of its focus on housing and the cost of living. \n\"We're getting stuck in a system right now that doesn't seem to be working,\" he said. \"It worked for our parents, but not for us.\"\nHe added that he has grown \"tired of the same Liberal policies for the last 10 years\".\nAhead of the election, support for the Conservatives outpaced the Liberals by 44% to 31.2% among 18 to 34 year olds, a Nanos poll on 25 April indicated. \nThe issues that resonated with Canadians depended on age, too. Carney campaigned heavily on standing up to Trump, while affordability and a broken \"Canadian promise\" were central to Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's message. \nAbacus Data polling indicated about 18% of 18 to 29 year olds were worried about Trump. That jumped to 45% for voters over 60, suggesting a diversion on key issues between generations.\nA big challenge for Carney and the Liberals will be how they can win back the confidence of  those younger voters, Mr Coletto said, who \"feel really let down and frustrated\".\nIn Monday's election, the Liberals managed to gain more than a dozen seats in a historic comeback election. \nBut the rival Conservatives also made significant gains - enough to block the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government.\nThe Liberals won 169 seats, three shy of a majority, and captured 43% of the popular vote. The Conservatives won 144 seats - 25 more than the previous 2021 election - and 41% of the popular vote.\nSmaller parties, namely the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), suffered significant losses as voters migrated to the two larger parties.\nCarney's platform did feature proposals on how to tackle affordability, including a pledge to build 500,000 homes annually and a small income tax cut for some Canadians.\nLaura Stephenson, chair of the political science department at Western University, noted the two platforms were not too different on cost of living issues.\n\"It is a question of differences in degree, rather than completely different approaches,\" Prof Stephenson said.\nIn his victory speech, Carney preached a message of unity as he acknowledged the millions of Canadians who cast ballots for other parties.\n\"My message to every Canadian is this: no matter where you live, no matter what language you speak, no matter how you voted, I will always do my best to represent everyone who calls Canada home,\" he said.\nCarney will also face a restive western Canada, where there is a festering sense of alienation from the power centre in Ottawa. \nThose tensions were on display quickly after the election. In a post congratulating Carney, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said Poilievre's vision \"inspired millions\", while the Liberals had \"demonized and demeaned\" her oil-rich province.\nShe called on Carney to \"reset the relationship between Ottawa and Alberta with meaningful action rather than hollow rhetoric\".\nWithout a majority, Carney will also have to work with other party leaders to get legislation passed. The Liberals could try to convince members of the NDP - and even the Conservatives - to cross the aisle, which could turn their strong minority to a majority.\nForming an effective government, as well binding regional and demographic fractures in Canada, is now one of the many items on Carney's to-do list. \nAdditional reporting by Jessica Murphy and Ali Abbas Ahmadi in Toronto.",

        "article_text": "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.\nThe main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.\nLast Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".\nThe attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.\nIn the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.\nThere is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations. \nWhile violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.\nTourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.\nAt a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.\nOther tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.\nAfter a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.\nAmong those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".\n\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.\nBut uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.\nIndian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.\nIndia and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.\nThe escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.\nIndian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.\nTop leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.\n\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.\nThe cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.\n\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"\nThe attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.\nThe timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.\nThe region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.\n\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.\nAs the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.\nIn an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.\nHe said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.\n\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?\n\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.",

Hope and fear as tourists trickle back to Kashmir town after attack5 hours agoShareSaveRaghvendra RaoBBC Hindi, PahalgamNikhil InamdarBBC News, LondonShareSaveSeraj AliSome tourists decided to stay back in Pahalgam because flight tickets back home were expensiveOne week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.The main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.Last Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.In the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.There is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.After a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.Among those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. \"Seraj AliIndian authorities have launched combing operations in Kashmir and destroyed homes belonging to alleged militants The attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. \"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir.TourismAsiaKashmir tensionsIndiaKashmir",

But he was injured in the next game against Brighton\nThe Everton forward has spoken about how relentless injury issues impacted his mental health - and at the end of the 2021-22 season said that talking 'saved his life'.\nHe says that past setbacks have built \"wisdom and character\", and that recently becoming a father has changed his perspective.\n\"I have had my moments with injuries and tough experiences with that. I'm older, I'm more mature, I'm a dad now and that has grounded me in ways I never knew possible,\" Calvert-Lewin says.\nThe striker is also known for his interest in fashion and has appeared on magazine covers and taken part in photoshoots for GQ Magazine - although the new father reveals that those days could be behind him.\n\"I'm a family man now and I have a young daughter, so my life has changed a lot.\" Calvert-Lewin says. \"It's given me different perspectives.\n\"My focus is on being the best player I can possibly be and be the best dad I can possibly be.\n\"I think on the fashion side of things, it's like anything, you grow and evolve, and it was appealing to me back then to showcase that.\n\"Everyone has hobbies and other interests besides things they do on a day-to-day basis.\n\"I also don't have time to think about what to put on in the morning when my daughter needs to get ready!\"\nEverton supporters will be keen to know if the striker is going to be a part of their squad for next season.\nCalvert-Lewin is one of a few players at Everton whose future is under discussion and BBC Sport has reported an offer is on the table. When asked about his situation, he says in his mind things are simple.\n\"I'm an Everton player and my focus will always be on doing my best for Everton and I have a lot of respect for Everton football club,\" he says.\n\"It's given me everything I have today.\n\"My main focus is making sure I am in the best condition, it is like going through a mini pre-season to get fit for these last four games.\n\"With the new manager coming in the club is moving in the right direction, there's a new stadium and there's a lot to be positive about.\n\"Who wouldn't want to be part of that?\n\"There was a lot of uncertainty for a long time a little bit higher up and arguably the last three seasons have been the most difficult in Everton's Premier League history and I have been there leading the line through that.\n\"For me it's built a lot of experience, and I have a lot of fond memories.

The blue I played was probably one of my best shots for many years,\" Williams told BBC Sport.\n\"What a blue...balls of steel. It was tough a shot. I could have gone in-off. I could have over cut it. I just went for it full-blooded.\n\"There was not one bit of nerves, maybe I've only had them a handful of times in my entire career.\"\nWilliams' victory over Higgins means he will face world number one Judd Trump next in a repeat of their 2022 semi-final.\n'How are we still here?' - Class of 92 graduates thrill Crucible again\nO'Sullivan moves past Si to reach Crucible last four\nWatch World Snooker Championship: O'Sullivan and Trump reach semi-finals\nMark Williams has reached the World Championship semi-finals eight times\nWhile world number six Williams has generally held sway over his fellow 'Class of 92' rival in Sheffield - winning five of their six meetings - it was still a first loss in a decider for Higgins at the Crucible since 1996.\nHowever, the prospect of it living up to the thriller they served up in the 2018 final, in which the Welshman eventually triumphed 18-16, appeared unlikely after the first four frames of the morning.\nWhile Williams said he belted out 'Delilah' by Tom Jones to inspire him before arriving, Higgins had appeared out of sorts and out of rhythm until the mid-session interval.  Only when he reappeared did he resemble the player that recently won the World Open and Tour Championship.\n\"I was poor the first four frames, but after the interval I had nothing to lose and played maybe the best four-frame burst of the whole event,\" said the Scot.\n\"I had my chance.

The blue I played was probably one of my best shots for many years,\" Williams told BBC Sport.

By doubling the rate of building, Carney hopes to have a supply of 500,000 new homes a year.\nThe Liberals want to create a standalone federal entity that would act as a developer for affordable housing. They plan to use this body to supply tens of billions of Canadian dollars in debt-financing for prefabricated home builders.\nLike people in other countries, Canadians have been grappling with higher prices for everyday goods while wages have failed to keep up - an issue over which Carney's party was criticised while under the stewardship of his predecessor Justin Trudeau. \nThe Liberals have proposed a slight tax cut for those in the lowest  bracket, who are due to see their rate reduce from 15% to 14%.\nCarney's party has also vowed to scrap sales taxes on homes under C$1m ($720,000; \u00a3540,000) for first-time buyers.\nIt also wants to make dental care available to lower-income Canadians by extending a national insurance programme to 4.5 million people aged 18 to 64. The plan currently covers children, the elderly and some disabled Canadians.\nThe Liberals have vowed to maintain the push on reducing emissions - as part of the fight against climate change - while ensuring Canadian companies are still competitive.\nCarney has promised to build a national \"east to west\" electricity grid to reduce energy dependence on the US.\nOne of his first moves as PM, before the election, was to repeal Trudeau's unpopular carbon pricing programme, which was designed to give financial incentives for people and firms to turn away from fossil fuels.\nBut Carney maintained a similar tax on large carbon emitters.\nIn his victory speech, he said: \"It's time to build Canada into an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy.\"\nCarney has vowed to raise defence spending to 2% of Canada's GDP, which is the target for all countries in the Nato military alliance.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nWSL highlights: Manchester United 0-1 Chelsea\nWhen it comes to the Women's Super League, Chelsea are playing against themselves as much as any other side.\nA 1-0 victory at Manchester United on Wednesday night secured the Blues' sixth successive WSL crown, and their first under new manager Sonia Bompastor.\nSuch regularity may have played a part in the rather muted celebrations at full-time - handshakes and hugs, rather than tears of joy.\nThere is also the Champions League, the holy grail for which Chelsea still search. \nThis title was secured three days after the Blues' attempts to win a first European title were ended, for the third successive season, by Barcelona - and, 8-2 on aggregate, more comprehensively than ever.\nSo how do Chelsea ensure this title win stands out among the six, and that this season - which could end in a domestic treble of WSL, League Cup and FA Cup - is somehow not categorised as a disappointment?\n\"We wanted to be unbeaten,\" Chelsea defender Lucy Bronze told Sky Sports, after scoring the winner at Leigh Sports Village.\n\"The fortunate thing for us this season is that we have stayed unbeaten so we knew there were still two things to play for. We knew before the game Arsenal had got beat and we knew what we needed, but we wanted to win, we wanted to be unbeaten all season.\n\"Although we have won the league tonight we have two games left and we want to win those too. We want to be unbeaten for the whole season.\"\nThe numbers behind Chelsea's latest WSL title\nOnly in three previous completed seasons has the WSL been won by an unbeaten side - Arsenal in 2012, Manchester City in 2016 and Chelsea themselves in 2018.\nBut it has never been done over the current format of a 22-game season. If Chelsea avoid defeat against Tottenham next Sunday then at home to Liverpool on 10 May, they will have broken new ground.\nBompastor will have to deal with the repercussions of such a disappointing Champions League exit - but registering perhaps the most comprehensive WSL title of all time will go some way to making up for it.\nIndeed, if Chelsea win their final two games, they will set a new WSL points record - beating their own tally of 58 in 2022-23. Victory in their remaining fixtures will make the Blues the first side to record 60 points in a campaign.\nSonia Bompastor has added the WSL title to the three French leagues she won with Lyon\n\"I always look for perfection and the ideal,\" Bompastor told her post-match media conference at Leigh Sports Village.\n\"I told my players out of position and defensively I want to keep a clean sheet. I want to fight for each other. We spoke about how we managed the depth and how we needed to be compact, win the duels and win the second balls. It is all these details. \n\"I am never satisfied. Even when we win I am already focused on the treble and the other finals.\"\nBompastor has become the first manager to lead a side to the WSL title in their maiden season since Laura Harvey took Arsenal to the top of the inaugural league in 2011.\nShe admitted she had worried about the pressure when she made her much-vaunted move from Lyon to London, and filling the shoes of predecessor Emma Hayes, who she praised fulsomely after beating Man Utd.\nThis video can not be played\nBompastor - proud of WSL title winners Chelsea\n\"When you come to Chelsea everyone expects you to win the league,\" she said. \"It was the same in Lyon but here the competition is higher. To be able to achieve it for six years in a row for Chelsea and in my first season, it is not easy. \n\"I heard some noise about the fact it is too easy for Chelsea but it is not! When you are able to be unbeaten, to beat Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United twice, I don't know how people can think that. It is unbelievable.\n\"Don't think it's easy. It's never easy. It's a great achievement and a lot of work every day. I don't let my players breathe.\n\"I want to thank Emma [Hayes]. I am sure she is really happy tonight with our title. She left the club in a great place to build on the legacy.\"\nChelsea have not always blown sides away this campaign - they have scored fewer goals than second-placed Arsenal, while no player has netted double figures in the league.\nWednesday night encapsulated their league campaign. United had more shots, a higher xG, and a very solid shout for a penalty before half-time when Millie Bright appeared to trip Grace Clinton. Chelsea keeper Hannah Hampton made five saves and was named player of the match.\nBut they find a way to win, and win, and win. And crucially, not lose.\n\"Coming to this club I always wanted to achieve trophies,\" Hampton told the BBC. \"The fact that I can say that in the two seasons I have been here we have won the title both times it is surreal. It never gets old. As many times as we win it, it'll never get old.\"\nChelsea's season now has three games to run - the two league fixtures, then the FA Cup final against Manchester United, again, on 18 May.\nTo end it unbeaten domestically would be a remarkable achievement.\n\"It's what dreams are made of for Sonia Bompastor,\" former England defender Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports. \"Her staff, the new players and the existing players that have done this before. They know what it feels like. They don't care where they do it or how they do it as long as they do it.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "BBC's North America team asked for your questions to mark US President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.\nHere is a selection of those answered by our staff writers and correspondents.  \nThey have aimed to explain the context and facts behind several of the biggest topics in the Trump administration, including the economy and how Trump would handle a war.\nA UK-based reader asks how the UK economy might be impacted by tariffs.\nThe decisions made thousands of miles away will affect the UK economy. Most directly affected are those exporters selling into America, contending with that 10% extra charge (or even more in some cases) being applied to their goods: Do they try to compensate for that by cutting costs elsewhere \u2013 or risk a blow to sales?\nAnd complex supply chains mean that disruption to other economies could be felt here. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey last week referred to a \"growth shock\" \u2013 many economists have cut their forecasts. No one yet is clear on how this trade war will play out, the uncertainty itself is damaging.\nBut the impact on inflation could work the other way. Countries such as China may be tempted to divert goods here instead, given the barriers they face in America. And the drop in oil and other commodity prices, amid market turmoil, could also bode well for keeping bills down.\nSo many economists reckon that with a weaker growth and inflation outlook, interest rates could fall faster than previously thought. A cut of 0.25 percentage points is widely expected next week, another could follow in June.\nAnother reader asks how Trump's immigration policy is likely to affect Canadian-American relations, especially for dual citizens or people with mixed-status families.\nIf the first 100 days are anything to go by, relations between Canada and the US are almost certainly going to continue to be tense - both as a result of tariffs and Trump's repeated, and near constant calls for Canada to become part of the US.\nWe had a taste of that just this week, when - as Canadians headed to the polls in their general election - Trump took to Truth Social to call on Canadians to elect him, seemingly referring to himself as a candidate, to reap the benefits of being the \"cherished\" 51st state.\n\"America can no longer subsidise Canada with the hundreds of billions a year that we have been spending in the past,\" he said. \"It makes no sense unless Canada is a state\".\nHow that impacts dual citizens or mixed-status families is a bit harder to answer.\nBut we're seen a newfound sense of nationalism among many Canadians in response to Trump's rhetoric and policies, and some Americans in Canada have even reportedly given up their citizenship.\nWhile cross-border ties are very unlikely to ground to a standstill, many Canadian citizens - even those with US families - are likely to be more cautious when crossing the border, particularly after high-profile cases of Canadians being detained at the border.\nIn one case, an actress named Jasmine Moody was detained by ICE for about two weeks, later writing about her experience in a viral article in the Guardian.\nA reader asks what Trump's first 100 days tell us about how he'd handle a major international crisis, like another pandemic or a war.\nIt's hard to say how exactly Trump would handle a major international crisis, but we have had glimpses that may provide a few clues.\nTrump's first crisis came just over a week into his administration on 29 January, when a US Army helicopter collided with a passenger aircraft over the Potomac river in Washington DC, killing 67 people.\nLater that morning, I sat in the White House briefing room as Trump - with no evidence - alleged that the diversity, equity and inclusion policies at the Federal Aviation Administration may have led to the crash.\nThis suggests that in the event of a crisis, Trump is later to \"fire from the hip\", sometimes speaking before all the facts are established. Many will remember Trump's initial dismissal of the Covid-19 pandemic in his first administration, sometimes downplaying it as something that would soon \"disappear\".\nMore so than other presidents, Trump also leans heavily on the power of the executive branch, making decisions from the Oval Office that have real-world implications, sometimes bypassing any discussion on Capitol Hill.\nThose close to Trump are quick to say that he listens intently to his advisors, often letting discussions play out amongst them before his eyes. This is, for example, largely what happened with the tariffs issue.\nUltimately, however, he is the one who decides the government's course of action, even if he lets his inner circle - which is perhaps more loyal and disciplined than in the last administration - carry out the details.\nArafin in Bangladesh wants to know how developing countries can navigate this evolving trade landscape and mitigate the risks.\nThere is just no way poorer countries could ever eliminate their trade surplus with the United States.\nThe world envisioned by Donald Trump - where citizens of developing countries buy as many American products as are sold the other way - is simply not possible.\nThe average Bangladeshi citizen, for example, is 32 times poorer than the average American.\nIn this case, the best Bangladeshi officials could do is promise Washington they will reduce some non-tariff barriers that are in place that make it hard for American companies to do business there.\nFor example, they could scrap quotas on imports, cut red tape or tackle corruption more effectively.\nThese small concessions - along with the assumption that American consumers won't put up with rocketing prices - may lead to a softening or removal of Trump's tariffs.\nAfter all, if countries with large and cheap workforces can't sell Americans affordable goods, then who will?\nOne other thing that developing countries will want to consider closely is the role of China in all of this.\nIf you're a worker in a clothing factory in Bangladesh, a 37% US tax might seem a crippling blow to your livelihood - but it's still better than the 125% tariff that Chinese manufacturers are facing.\nAs a Malaysian rubber glove manufacturer told me recently: \"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit us\".\nLimiting dealings with China has been suggested as a way for developing countries to get a better trade deal with the White House. But that isn't very realistic.\nBeijing is by far and away the number one investor in the developing world. If you live in Africa, Asia or South America - it's probably China building your railways, factories and power plants, not the United States.\nThe American consumer market is still the richest in the world and developing countries will want to fight tooth and nail to maintain access to it - but equally there is no way they can side with the US over China.\n\nChris in County Durham, UK, asks if Donald Trump is making millions of dollars on the US stock market by initiating a slump in share values, buying heavy, then reversing his policies to watch his share prices rocket up.\nCritics are accusing President Trump of manipulating the stock market. White House officials have denied the allegations, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it part of Trump's \"art of the deal\".\nHere's what we know so far:\nOn 9 April, Trump posted on Truth Social, in all caps: \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY! DJT.\" Shortly after, he announced he was pausing the toughest tariffs for 90 days. In between, options traders placed big bets on a market rebound, which ended up being spot on.\nThis led to accusations of market manipulation and insider trading, with Democrats like Senator Adam Schiff calling for an investigation.\nHowever, these cases are hard to prove \u2013 and even harder when you're talking about the president. Legal experts say it would be a \"high\" bar to prove Trump did something illegal in this case. Plus he posted the information publicly.\nClaims of insider trading might have some merit under the STOCK Act, which restricts public officials from profiting off non-public information. Although the White House could argue that the President can't \"gain\" information about policy changes if he \"created\" them.\nSo, it's still up in the air \u2013 but probably not something he needs to lose sleep over.\nJean-Claude asks if there any way within the US Constitution by which Congress could stop Trump's tariffs and take away his freedom to issue Executive Orders at will.\nDonald Trump has been pushing the boundaries of presidential authority with both his tariff declarations and more than 130 executive orders.\nTo do so, he has been asserting that Congress has given him the power to take these actions. To answer your question simply, then - any power that Congress gives, Congress can take back.\nTraditionally, executive orders are a presidential interpretation of how laws should be implemented. Congress could step in and tell the White House that those interpretations are wrong.\nTrump has been citing a 1977 law that grants him power to enact tariffs in cases of national emergency. Congress could amend that law or pass legislation that says no such emergency exists. There has already been a bipartisan proposal in the Senate to do exactly that.\nThe challenge for Trump's opponents is finding a majority in the two chambers of Congress, both narrowly controlled by Republicans, to do so. The House of Representatives, in particular, is full of Republicans who are marching in lockstep with the president. The House recently adopted a provision that would make it much harder to rescind Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, for instance.\nEven if Congress was able to reach agreement on curtailing presidential power, Trump could decide to exercise his veto to block it from becoming law \u2013 something he's already threated to do with the Senate tariff bill. And if he did that, it would take two-thirds of both chambers to override the president.\nSo Congress does have the ability to stop Trump, but perhaps not the interest or will to do so \u2013 at least not unless and until next year's midterm elections shift the balance of power in the legislature toward the Democrats.\nRachel in Canada wonders if we can comment on what the real threat of annexation is for Canada with Trump in office. Should we be worried?\nA lot depends on what the US president means when he talks about making Canada the 51st state.\nIt's unlikely that both the US and Canada would agree to it through formal means - the bar is high.\nIt would need to be approved by both chambers in the US Congress, including at least 60 votes in support in the Senate, which has 100 seats.\nIt would also likely require amending the Canadian constitution, which would likely require unanimous provincial consent - no easy task - as well as Parliament's approval.\nIt's also highly unlikely that the US would invade Canada militarily.\nTrump has spoken about forcing the issue through economic pressure - with Canada sending roughly 75% of its good south of the border, he does have some leverage.\nCanada has already been hit with tariffs from the US, including the blanket tariffs on goods, though there is currently an exception for products covered by the USMCA trade deal. Those US tariffs are already being felt in some sectors.\nHowever, Trump also appears willing to come to the negotiating table. He has said he is ready to start talks with Canada's prime minister after the federal election.\nKevin in Stockport has two questions for James Lansdale, BBC News diplomatic correspondent: Not long ago President Trump said that if Russia didn't agree to take serious steps towards ending the war he would apply massive sanctions. Russia has shown no desire to reach a peace settlement. So why is Trump not going to apply these threatened sanctions before considering ending the peace initiative?\nDonald Trump is becoming increasingly frustrated at the refusal of Vladimir Putin to agree an immediate unconditional ceasefire. Recently, after his talks with President Zelensky at the Vatican, Mr Trump questioned whether Mr Putin really wanted peace and wondered if the Russian leader was leading him on. He also once again threatened \"banking\" or \"secondary\" sanctions. \nThe latter refers to sanctions on countries that are still trading with Moscow, especially those countries \u2013 like China and India \u2013 that are fuelling the Russian war machine by buying cheap Russian energy. But imposing those sanctions would be a big step with serious economic and geostrategic consequences. So for now, Mr Trump appears to want to threaten these sanctions rather than impose them.\nWhat is the hold that Putin has over Trump?\nAnalysts say that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin developed a genuinely warm personal relationship during his first term in the White House. They say Mr Trump sees in Mr Putin an equal on the world stage whom he respects. \nThe US president also made clear he wants a rapprochement between the US and Russia, one that will reset the relationship and boost trade. Strategists say the White House is also currying favour with the Kremlin because it wants to divide Moscow from Beijing, with many US policymakers seeing China as the greater threat. As to whether Mr Putin has some kind of \"hold\" over Mr Trump, there have been many allegations about the close business links the President had over the years with Russian figures who helped his investments. \nThere were also many claims of secret Kompromat about the President held in Kremlin archives. The FBI investigated. But there was always more speculation than hard fact. So Mr Trump's relationship with Mr Putin remains something of a mystery.\nRay in the UK asks: As a convicted felon, Donald Trump isn't allowed in the UK, so how can he address Parliament?\nIt is a bit more complicated than that.\nGovernment guidance \u2013 which you can read here \u2013 spells out where it is mandatory that someone is refused entry and where it is discretionary.\nIn reality, the elected leader of an ally, in particular an ally as important as the United States, is always likely to be invited, because a government is likely to conclude that this is in the UK's national interest.\nThat is the conclusion of Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 and hence the state visit being offered to President Trump.\nThe opportunity, or not, to address Parliament is a separate question and something some are arguing should be blocked.\nOne reader, Ray, asks our BBC Security correspondent Frank Gardner: Is Trump going to give Europe the time to step in, if he decides to ditch Ukraine? \nThe transatlantic alliance - the strategic partnership between Europe and North America based on shared values - is now under more strain than at any time since the Suez Crisis of 1956.\nWithin his first 100 days President Trump has completely upended the policy of the previous US administrations. For most of the time since taking office, he has appeared to favour relations with Moscow over those with Kyiv. He has also gone against the wishes of most of Europe by vowing to end Russia's isolation and talked of lifting sanctions.\nWhereas the prevailing attitude in Europe towards Ukraine is to keep supporting its war effort 'for as long as it takes', Trump has been in a hurry to end the war and normalise relations with President Putin.\nTrump's oft-repeated intent to 'get' Greenland and make it a part of the US has appalled Denmark, of which it is a self-governing part and it has rattled Scandinavian governments. Denmark lost 257 soldiers killed and wounded in the US-led campaign in Afghanistan.  It had the highest per capita death toll of all America's allies in that war.\nTrump has, however, galvanised Europe into finally doing more for its own defence.  \nAfter the US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO in February that Europe should no longer take US strategic protection for granted, budgets are being revised and Germany has now lifted its longstanding restrictions on defence spending.",

        "summary": "Although the White House could argue that the President can't \"gain\" information about policy changes if he \"created\" them.So, it's still up in the air \u2013 but probably not something he needs to lose sleep over.Jean-Claude asks if there any way within the US Constitution by which Congress could stop Trump's tariffs and take away his freedom to issue Executive Orders at will.Donald Trump has been pushing the boundaries of presidential authority with both his tariff declarations and more than 130 executive orders.To do so, he has been asserting that Congress has given him the power to take these actions. So for now, Mr Trump appears to want to threaten these sanctions rather than impose them.What is the hold that Putin has over Trump?Analysts say that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin developed a genuinely warm personal relationship during his first term in the White House.

This is, for example, largely what happened with the tariffs issue.Ultimately, however, he is the one who decides the government's course of action, even if he lets his inner circle - which is perhaps more loyal and disciplined than in the last administration - carry out the details.Arafin in Bangladesh wants to know how developing countries can navigate this evolving trade landscape and mitigate the risks.There is just no way poorer countries could ever eliminate their trade surplus with the United States.The world envisioned by Donald Trump - where citizens of developing countries buy as many American products as are sold the other way - is simply not possible.The average Bangladeshi citizen, for example, is 32 times poorer than the average American.In this case, the best Bangladeshi officials could do is promise Washington they will reduce some non-tariff barriers that are in place that make it hard for American companies to do business there.For example, they could scrap quotas on imports, cut red tape or tackle corruption more effectively.These small concessions - along with the assumption that American consumers won't put up with rocketing prices - may lead to a softening or removal of Trump's tariffs.After all, if countries with large and cheap workforces can't sell Americans affordable goods, then who will?One other thing that developing countries will want to consider closely is the role of China in all of this.If you're a worker in a clothing factory in Bangladesh, a 37% US tax might seem a crippling blow to your livelihood - but it's still better than the 125% tariff that Chinese manufacturers are facing.As a Malaysian rubber glove manufacturer told me recently: \"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit us\".Limiting dealings with China has been suggested as a way for developing countries to get a better trade deal with the White House. The House recently adopted a provision that would make it much harder to rescind Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, for instance.Even if Congress was able to reach agreement on curtailing presidential power, Trump could decide to exercise his veto to block it from becoming law \u2013 something he's already threated to do with the Senate tariff bill.",

You can probably guess what he is like...\"\nA lot of people have been asking. Because a lot of people have been watching.\nIt is not just what Pollock has done in the past 12 months - winning the Under-20 World Cup, scoring two tries on his senior England debut, being nominated for the Champions Cup player of the year, preparing to line up against Leinster in Saturday's semi-final and butting into the Lions selection conversation.\nIt is the way he has done it.\nThe 20-year-old back row has swagger and self-possession, and a side order of skulduggery.\nThere has been no dutiful trade-learning and spur-earning.\nInstead, just prodigious talent, Tigger-ish energy, galloping pace and a presumption that the world is his for the taking.\nIt gets people talking. And has done for a while.\nEighteen months ago a video circulated among Bedford's players.\nThey had been told that Pollock, then only 18, was joining them in the Championship on loan.\n\"He came with a little bit of a reputation as he was very well thought of by Saints' academy,\" says Bedford's Alex Woolford.\n\"This viral clip of him did the rounds among us. He was being interviewed after an England Under-18 win over South Africa and swore three times in about 10 seconds.\n\"We knew he was going to be very enthusiastic.\"\nHe was.\n\"We were pretty poor in the first half against Ampthill,\" adds Woolford, remembering Pollock's first start.\n\"Henry tried to give us the hairdryer treatment. He was effing and blinding and telling us we were not good enough and I remember thinking 'bloody hell, what is this kid doing?'\n\"But you have to give him credit.\n\"In rugby environments it is very easy to get confidence confused with arrogance. For all the stick he gets, I don't actually think he is an arrogant person.\"\nPollock spent part of the 2023-24 season on loan at Championship side Bedford\nStill, that perception persists.\nFreeman and Woolford say Pollock is a different, calmer character off the pitch, and his Northampton team-mates assured the rest of the England camp that the incoming youngster wasn't the \"idiot\" they were expecting., external \nTheir PR work was duly undermined by Pollock gleefully ripping the ball from Ollie Chessum when tasked with holding a tackle shield in an early training drill.\n\"Probably some of the boys were quite shocked with how I was when I first joined up with England,\" Pollock told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"But I guess over time they realised this is just him.\n\"I am quite loud, someone that just brings a different type of energy to other types of players. Whether that is good or bad energy depends who you are talking to.\"\nPollock scored two tries when he made his senior England debut off the bench against Wales in Cardiff in March\nThere are plenty of fans.\nAt Franklin's Gardens kids wear his distinctive black head tape and make cardboard signs asking for Pollock's boots.\nThey love his celebrations. A basketball-style finger-roll lob in the direction of a beaten defender against Castres and an extravagant swallow dive against Bristol were two recent efforts. \nThey love his cunning. Pollock cheekily pulling the sock of Wales prop Gareth Thomas to milk a penalty gained social media traction during the Six Nations.\nAnd they love his abrasive style as he goes nose-to-nose with the opposition, raising tempers and the stakes.\n\"I want to entertain and get the crowd as close as possible to the team,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton's Saints Show.\n\"When I was growing up there, there was a lack of a idols. There were one or two that stick in my mind - Courtney Lawes, Michael Hooper, Richie McCaw - but not many.\n\"For this game to grow and this sport to get bigger, we need more characters, more players the fans want to come and watch.\n\"If you look to the football world, fans very much have their players and the personalities they like.\"\nThis video can not be played\nPollock ruffling feathers!\nPollock is harder to warm to when you are up against him.\nWoolford, Pollock's Bedford team-mate, also faced him in the Blues' annual pre-season fixture against Saints.\n\"On the pitch he is very loud, very confrontational, very in-your-face,\" Woolford remembers.\n\"He just exhausts you, as much mentally and emotionally as physically. But he has backed it up at every level he has stepped up to.\"\nIn the teams' most recent match, one Bedford player attempted to sledge back at Pollock, suggesting he would be back with the Blues on loan by October.\nInstead, by then, Pollock was a Premiership regular.\n\"Being annoying is part of my game,\" Pollock agrees.\n\"I want to wind the opposition up; I want to get under their skin. It is something I relish.\"\nThis weekend he will be digging into Leinster in a re-run of last season's Champions Cup semi-final.\nThe Irish giants could field back-row trio Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier and Jack Conan.\n\"It is probably one of the best back rows there is,\" says Pollock. \"I am just excited to be able to say I played against them. To share the field with them is special.\"\nBut the deference won't last past the first whistle.\n\"They are beatable,\" he adds. \"We definitely see parts of their game we can attack and go after and hopefully ruffle a few feathers.\"\nIf Pollock's streak of success extends to the Aviva Stadium and his final and toughest Lions audition, he could well make the squad cut five days later.\n\"I have heard the rumours and stuff, but as a player you can't control that,\" he says.\n\"I just have to keep playing well, and if it happens, it happens.\"\nSo far in his career, things invariably do.\nPollock played in England A's win over an Australia second string at the start of this season before being promoted into the senior side",

        "article_text": "Vaibhav Suryavanshi has the highest strike-rate of all batters in this year's IPL\nWhy hit a single when you can hit the ball for a six?\nThat was the very question posed by 14-year-old batting sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi to one of his first coaches in professional cricket.\n\"Vaibhav was hitting sixes and fours off almost every ball,\" recalls Manish Ojha, a former first-class cricketer for Jharkhand.\n\"After the session, I said: 'Vaibhav, why are you only hitting boundaries? The state matches are a four-day format and we will need you to take more singles.' He replied: 'Sir, if I can hit a ball for six, why would I take a single off it?' That's when I realised he was ready for the next level.\"\nThat six-hitting lit up the most glamourous of cricketing stages on Monday when the teenager became the youngest player to score a century in men's T20 cricket.\nBatting for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans, he took down some of the world's best bowlers in a scintillating 38-ball innings that included 11 sixes and seven fours.\nExperienced international bowlers Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar and Rashid Khan were treated with the same disdain as those unlucky 12-year-olds who netted with Suryavanshi a couple of years earlier.\n14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi stuns the IPL\n'Remember the name' - cricket world reacts to Suryavanshi century\nVaibhav's entry to the IPL has been dramatic. He started his career with a six off the first ball he faced and went on to score a hundred in just his third appearance.\nBorn in Samastipur, a small district in India's Bihar, he quickly showed promise. Vaibhav's father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, himself a club-level cricketer, saw a spark in his son. But there were no proper academies around the district, so he started his training at home from the age of five.\nSanjeev, who used to run a small shop, began to realise his son needed a proper coach. So when Vaibhav turned eight, his father decided to take him to Patna city, a three-hour journey away.\n\"Many people would tell him: 'What are you doing?' But he was the first person to believe in Vaibhav's abilities,\" said Robin Singh, a coach from Bihar.\n\"To ensure his son trained well and got to use the best facilities, his father had to sell a plot of land. His mother had to make a lot of sacrifices too. She would wake up at three in the morning to prepare breakfast for him and would even send food for the coaches.\"\nVaibhav impressed his new coaches in no time.\n\"When I started working with him, I found him quite different from others. You would give him a demo of a technique or a shot, and he would pick it up in no time,\" Ojha said.\n\"Most of the players adopt things easily in practice, but when it comes to playing matches, they fail. But the unique feature about Vaibhav was that he would execute things perfectly even during high-pressure matches.\"\nVaibhav was always ahead of his age group. From his strokeplay to game awareness, he would stand out.\n\"Within 10 days of playing alongside the kids of his age, we realised we were wasting his time. So, we started making him practise with senior players,\" Singh recalled.\nVaibhav would practise daily from 7.30am to 4pm, facing 450 balls each day. By the time he was 12, his coaches were confident enough to let him pursue cricket professionally.\nHe played for the Bihar under-19s team and amassed consistent runs, prompting selectors to name him in the India Under-19s team. Aged just 13, he smashed a 58-ball hundred in a youth Test against Australia.\nHe was soon drafted into Bihar's squad for the Ranji Trophy (India's premier first-class tournament) before becoming the youngest player to get a contract at the IPL auction as Rajasthan signed him for \u00a3103,789 (1.1 crore rupees) in December 2024.\n\"Vaibhav's role model is Brian Lara, so his game is aggressive, and he plays the ball on merit without any fear at all,\" Ojha added.\n\"We expected him to get an IPL contract, and our joy doubled the moment Rajasthan Royals got him because they have [India legend] Rahul Dravid on their coaching staff.\"\nSingh added: \"When he became the youngest to debut in first-class cricket, I told him: 'Anyone can become the youngest. I'll be happy when you become the youngest centurion.' So yesterday he called me up after scoring the century and said: 'Sir, youngest centurion.' And I couldn't be prouder.\"\nAlmost half of the runs Suryavanshi has scored in the IPL (46%) have come through the mid-wicket and long-on region. He is particularly savage against pace bowling, scoring more than 100 runs at a strike-rate of 243 in this season's IPL against the quicker men\nSuryavanshi has already been nicknamed Boss Baby in cricketing circles by those who see comparisons with Chris Gayle, aka The Universe Boss.\nWest Indian Gayle still holds the record for the fastest IPL century, having taken just 30 balls in 2013, but nobody else has scored one quicker in the competition, while he easily beat the record of 18 years and 118 days for the fastest T20 century which was previously held by Maharashtra's Vijay Zol.\nSachin Tendulkar - the greatest run-scorer of all time - made his India debut aged just 16, and Suryavanshi's former coach believe he will soon follow The Little Master into the national team.\n\"A guy from a small village in Bihar has made it to the IPL. The whole world is talking about him. So, he knows how to open doors. Don't be surprised if he makes it to international level soon,\" Singh said.\nBefore then, Suryavanshi, who has been gifted almost \u00a39,000 by his state government following his IPL century, has his sights set on title-chasing Mumbai Indians on Thursday, where he comes face-to-face with Jasprit Bumrah, the world's best bowler.\nListen to live commentary on Rajasthan Royals v Mumbai Indians on Thursday, live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app\nSuryavanshi's century has made the front pages of the newspapers in India \n1 of 3\nIPL auction: Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Rishabh Pant make history\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

We've gotta pick it up and I've spoken to a lot of peers who all had the same feeling.\"\nLorde's lead single, What Was That, was officially released last week after being teased on TikTok, debuting in the UK Top 10.\nLorde says it gives a flavour of her upcoming album, where she's tried to reconnect with her younger self.\n\"I really went into it like, 'just make something for you, just make something you think is cool',\" she says.\n\"It's not unlike how I was making music as a 15-year-old, just trying to impress myself.\n\"What Was That was the first song from this album that I wrote and was like, 'OK, I know where to go with this',\" she says, describing the track as \"Lorde canon\" and \"recognisably me\". \n\"It's funny to be 12 years into your career and for people to have an understanding of your tropes and what you do.\" \nThe singer says she \"wanted to lock people back in\" to her sound after her last album, 2021's Solar Power, which she says was \"a very different flavour for me\".\n\"It's about going to the core of who I am in the purest way possible, stripping away anything unnecessary.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

You can probably guess what he is like...\"\nA lot of people have been asking. Because a lot of people have been watching.\nIt is not just what Pollock has done in the past 12 months - winning the Under-20 World Cup, scoring two tries on his senior England debut, being nominated for the Champions Cup player of the year, preparing to line up against Leinster in Saturday's semi-final and butting into the Lions selection conversation.\nIt is the way he has done it.\nThe 20-year-old back row has swagger and self-possession, and a side order of skulduggery.\nThere has been no dutiful trade-learning and spur-earning.\nInstead, just prodigious talent, Tigger-ish energy, galloping pace and a presumption that the world is his for the taking.\nIt gets people talking. And has done for a while.\nEighteen months ago a video circulated among Bedford's players.\nThey had been told that Pollock, then only 18, was joining them in the Championship on loan.\n\"He came with a little bit of a reputation as he was very well thought of by Saints' academy,\" says Bedford's Alex Woolford.\n\"This viral clip of him did the rounds among us. He was being interviewed after an England Under-18 win over South Africa and swore three times in about 10 seconds.\n\"We knew he was going to be very enthusiastic.\"\nHe was.\n\"We were pretty poor in the first half against Ampthill,\" adds Woolford, remembering Pollock's first start.\n\"Henry tried to give us the hairdryer treatment. He was effing and blinding and telling us we were not good enough and I remember thinking 'bloody hell, what is this kid doing?'\n\"But you have to give him credit.\n\"In rugby environments it is very easy to get confidence confused with arrogance. For all the stick he gets, I don't actually think he is an arrogant person.\"\nPollock spent part of the 2023-24 season on loan at Championship side Bedford\nStill, that perception persists.\nFreeman and Woolford say Pollock is a different, calmer character off the pitch, and his Northampton team-mates assured the rest of the England camp that the incoming youngster wasn't the \"idiot\" they were expecting., external \nTheir PR work was duly undermined by Pollock gleefully ripping the ball from Ollie Chessum when tasked with holding a tackle shield in an early training drill.\n\"Probably some of the boys were quite shocked with how I was when I first joined up with England,\" Pollock told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"But I guess over time they realised this is just him.\n\"I am quite loud, someone that just brings a different type of energy to other types of players. Whether that is good or bad energy depends who you are talking to.\"\nPollock scored two tries when he made his senior England debut off the bench against Wales in Cardiff in March\nThere are plenty of fans.\nAt Franklin's Gardens kids wear his distinctive black head tape and make cardboard signs asking for Pollock's boots.\nThey love his celebrations. A basketball-style finger-roll lob in the direction of a beaten defender against Castres and an extravagant swallow dive against Bristol were two recent efforts. \nThey love his cunning. Pollock cheekily pulling the sock of Wales prop Gareth Thomas to milk a penalty gained social media traction during the Six Nations.\nAnd they love his abrasive style as he goes nose-to-nose with the opposition, raising tempers and the stakes.\n\"I want to entertain and get the crowd as close as possible to the team,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton's Saints Show.\n\"When I was growing up there, there was a lack of a idols. There were one or two that stick in my mind - Courtney Lawes, Michael Hooper, Richie McCaw - but not many.\n\"For this game to grow and this sport to get bigger, we need more characters, more players the fans want to come and watch.\n\"If you look to the football world, fans very much have their players and the personalities they like.\"\nThis video can not be played\nPollock ruffling feathers!\nPollock is harder to warm to when you are up against him.\nWoolford, Pollock's Bedford team-mate, also faced him in the Blues' annual pre-season fixture against Saints.\n\"On the pitch he is very loud, very confrontational, very in-your-face,\" Woolford remembers.\n\"He just exhausts you, as much mentally and emotionally as physically. But he has backed it up at every level he has stepped up to.\"\nIn the teams' most recent match, one Bedford player attempted to sledge back at Pollock, suggesting he would be back with the Blues on loan by October.\nInstead, by then, Pollock was a Premiership regular.\n\"Being annoying is part of my game,\" Pollock agrees.\n\"I want to wind the opposition up; I want to get under their skin. It is something I relish.\"\nThis weekend he will be digging into Leinster in a re-run of last season's Champions Cup semi-final.\nThe Irish giants could field back-row trio Caelan Doris, Josh van der Flier and Jack Conan.\n\"It is probably one of the best back rows there is,\" says Pollock. \"I am just excited to be able to say I played against them. To share the field with them is special.\"\nBut the deference won't last past the first whistle.\n\"They are beatable,\" he adds. \"We definitely see parts of their game we can attack and go after and hopefully ruffle a few feathers.\"\nIf Pollock's streak of success extends to the Aviva Stadium and his final and toughest Lions audition, he could well make the squad cut five days later.\n\"I have heard the rumours and stuff, but as a player you can't control that,\" he says.\n\"I just have to keep playing well, and if it happens, it happens.\"\nSo far in his career, things invariably do.\nPollock played in England A's win over an Australia second string at the start of this season before being promoted into the senior side",

        "article_text": "John Higgins, Mark Williams and Ronnie O'Sullivan have all been at the top level of snooker for more than 30 years\nAt a combined age of 99, two of snooker's all-time greats go head-to-head on Tuesday as John Higgins takes on Mark Williams with a place in the World Championship semi-finals up for grabs.\nThe sport's legendary 'Class of 92', with Ronnie O'Sullivan completing the trio, have won 14 world titles between them - and are all still going strong this year.\nWilliams turned 50 last month, Higgins reaches his half century 13 days after this year's final with O'Sullivan celebrating his 50th birthday in December.\nBut they have proved that age is just a number.\nCould one of them again go all the way at the Crucible?\nThe first session of their best-of-25 quarter-final takes place on Tuesday at 10:00 BST, with the second session at 19:00 BST, before the match is played to a finish from 10:00 BST on Wednesday\nWilliams has become the oldest man to reach the last eight at the Crucible since six-time winner Steve Davis did so at the age of 52 back in 2010.\nBut one of Williams' fiercest opponents stands in his way.\n\"Twenty years ago, we were really big rivals - now we walk into the practice room and we give each other a nod as if to say: 'How are we still here competing with everybody?'\" said Higgins.\nIt is a sentiment Williams agrees with.\n\"Normally the older you get, the worse you get,\" he said. \"Your eyes are going, everything is going and your stamina drops a bit and you get tired a lot more easier.\n\"But somehow us three are hanging around like a bad smell.\"\nWith O'Sullivan in the opposite half of the draw a final between two of the 'Class of 92', named after the year they turned professional, is a real possibility.\n\"If one of those three players was to win the World Championship, maybe beat a young whippersnapper in the final, what an achievement that would be. Maybe their best ever achievement,\" said Davis.\nFifteen years ago, Davis defeated Mark King 10-9 in the Crucible first round, won 13-11 against a then-34-year-old Higgins, the reigning champion, before losing 13-5 to eventual winner Neil Robertson in the last eight.\n\"It was a fantastic buzz, I maybe ran out of belief,\" recalled Davis.\n\"Hopefully they don't do that. They are much more in touch with the top part of the game than I was.\"\nMark Williams and John Higgins at the China Open in March 2006\nThe trio's achievements are legendary. O'Sullivan has seven world titles, Higgins four and Williams three.\nIf any of them lift the trophy on Monday, 5 May, they would become the oldest winner in the modern era, breaking O'Sullivan's record when he won it three years ago, aged 46.\nThirty-three years ago they were all hungry, driven, talented teenagers with the desire to reach the top.\nWilliams described how he first met Higgins at the final of an event in 1990, when they were both 15.\n\"We played in the final and he beat me,\" said the Welshman. \"It was live on TV and he beat me 6-1, he had five grand for a win, I had three grand for runner-up.\n\"We then played in the British Under-16s in Birmingham and I thrashed him 4-0 after 50 minutes and I got 200 quid so I was a week late.\n\"That was the first time I really remembered John as it was me and O'Sullivan playing in all the junior events when we were 13 and 14.\"\nWilliams and Higgins have their own Crucible history and have met five times, with four victories for Williams, including an 18-16 success in an epic showdown in the 2018 final.\n\"That world final was one of the best games I've ever been involved in and people say it was the best final ever,\" said Williams.\nWilliams hopes eye surgery in June will help to extend his snooker career\nKen Doherty, the 1997 world champion, played against the 'Class of 92' throughout his career and felt this match was \"the tie of the round\".\n\"They've been at the top of the game since 1992, 33 years, and are still at the top and still producing,\" the Irishman said.\n\"As you get older it becomes a lot more difficult as players like me, Stephen Hendry, Alan McManus, Peter Ebdon have all found out. It's hard to cope in terms of tension, intensity and also to be able to devote your life to the game.\n\"You become a father, a family man and it's hard to dedicate themselves to the game but they still have the appetite, willingness and hunger and that's an incredible talent as well.\n\"I've been logging heads with them for 30 years. I've beaten them all but also lost to them all in big finals. I just had great times playing them and you used to relish it as it was a great test of your own game.\"\nDoherty, who is part of the BBC TV team for the competition, felt the atmosphere would be electric.\n\"When you see them coming into the Crucible for their match they will get a standing ovation as they did in the Masters,\" he added. \"We might not see the kind of these three again so we have to enjoy them while we can. They've given the sport great entertainment, great matches and are still delivering.\"\nShaun Murphy tipped Judd Trump, who beat him 13-10 on Monday, to win the title but thought the Williams-Higgins clash would be \"fabulous for the sport\".\nHe added: \"The Class of 92 are three of the best players we've ever seen and it's wonderful we still get to watch them.\n\"None of them would be here if they didn't want to be, they obviously love it enough to put themselves through it.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan became the oldest man in the modern era to become world champion with his victory over Judd Trump in the 2022 final\nWorld number one Trump will play the winner of Williams-Higgins in the semi-final if he triumphs in his own quarter-final against Luca Brecel.\nTrump felt the veteran trio would continue to feature at the top level for years to come.\n\"They inspired me a little bit, especially Ronnie and John when I was younger,\" said Trump. \"Ronnie was someone I really looked up to. They're miles away from retiring and not far from their absolute best.\n\"When I played Williams in the semi-finals (when Trump won a final-frame decider for a 17-16 win in 2022) I've never seen him play like that.\n\"These three could be here when they're 65 if they wanted to be.\"",
