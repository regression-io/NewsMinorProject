        "article_text": "This is the gravest crisis for Western security since the end of World War Two, and a lasting one. As one expert puts it, \"Trumpism will outlast his presidency\". But which nations are equipped to step to the fore as the US stands back?\nAt 09.00 one morning in February 1947, the UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Inverchapel, walked into the State Department to hand the US Secretary of State, George Marshall, two diplomatic messages printed on blue paper to emphasise their importance: one on Greece, the other on Turkey.\nExhausted, broke and heavily in debt to the United States, Britain told the US that it could no longer continue its support for the Greek government forces that were fighting an armed Communist insurgency. Britain had already announced plans to pull out of Palestine and India and to wind down its presence in Egypt.\nThe United States saw immediately that there was now a real danger that Greece would fall to the Communists and, by extension, to Soviet control. And if Greece went, the United States feared that Turkey could be next, giving Moscow control of the Eastern Mediterranean including, potentially, the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route.\nAlmost overnight, the United States stepped into the vacuum left by the departing British.\n\"It must be a policy of the United States,\" President Harry Truman announced, \"to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure.\"\nIt was the start of what became known as the Truman Doctrine. At its heart was the idea that helping to defend democracy abroad was vital to the United States' national interests.\nThere followed two major US initiatives: the Marshall Plan, a massive package of assistance to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe, and the creation of Nato in 1949, which was designed to defend democracies from a Soviet Union that had now extended its control over the eastern part of Europe.\nIt is easy to see this as the moment that leadership of the western world passed from Britain to the United States. More accurately it is the moment that revealed that it already had. \nThe United States, traditionally isolationist and safely sheltered by two vast oceans, had emerged from World War Two as the leader of the free world. As America projected its power around the globe, it spent the post-war decades remaking much of the world in its own image. \nThe baby boomer generation grew up in a world that looked, sounded and behaved more like the United States than ever before. And it became the western world's cultural, economic and military hegemon.\nYet the fundamental assumptions on which the United States has based its geostrategic ambitions now look set to change.\nDonald Trump is the first US President since World War Two to challenge the role that his country set for itself many decades ago. And he is doing this in such a way that, to many, the old world order appears to be over - and the new world order has yet to take shape.\nThe question is, which nations will step forward? And, with the security of Europe under greater strain than at any time almost in living memory, can its leaders, who are currently scrabbling around, find an adequate response?\nPresident Trump's critique of the post-1945 international order dates back decades. Nearly 40 years ago he took out full-page advertisements in three US newspapers to criticise the United States' commitment to the defence of the world's democracies.\n\"For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States,\" he wrote in 1987. \"Why are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing to protect their interests?\n\"The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help.\"\nIt's a position he has repeated since his second inauguration. \nAnd the fury felt by some in his administration for what they perceive as European reliance on the United States was apparently shown in the leaked messages about air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that emerged this week.\nIn the messages, an account named Vice-President JD Vance wrote that European countries might benefit from the strikes. It said: \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"\nAnother account, identified as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"\nTrump's own position appears to go beyond criticising those he says are taking advantage of the United State's generosity. At the start of his second presidency, he seemed to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling Russia that Ukraine would not be granted Nato membership and that it should not expect to get back the territory it has lost to Russia. \nMany saw this as giving away two major bargaining chips before talks had even started. He apparently asked Russia for nothing in return.\nOn the flipside, certain Trump supporters see in Putin a strong leader who embodies many of the conservative values they themselves share. \nTo some, Putin is an ally in a \"war on woke\".\nThe United States' foreign policy is now driven, in part at least, by the imperatives of its culture wars. The security of Europe has become entangled in the battle between two polarised and mutually antagonistic visions of what the United States stands for. \nSome think the division is about more than Trump's particular views and that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to end. \n\"The US is becoming divorced from European values,\" argues Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. \"That's difficult [for Europeans] to swallow because it means that it's structural, cultural and potentially long-term. \"\n\"I think the current trajectory of the US will outlast Trump, as a person. I think Trumpism will outlast his presidency.\"\nThe Trump White House has said it will no longer be the primary guarantor of European security, and that European nations should be responsible for their own defence and pay for it.\n\"If [Nato countries] don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them,\" the president said earlier this month.\nFor almost 80 years, the cornerstone of European security has been embedded in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one member state of the alliance is an attack on all. \nIn Downing Street last month, just before his visit to the White House, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told me during an interview that he was satisfied that the United States remained the leading member of Nato and that Trump personally remained committed to Article 5.\nOthers are less sure.\nBen Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative government, told me earlier this month: \"I think Article 5 is on life support. \n\"If Europe, including the United Kingdom, doesn't step up to the plate, invest a lot on defence and take it seriously, it's potentially the end of the Nato that we know and it'll be the end of Article 5.\n\"Right now, I wouldn't bet my house that Article 5 would be able to be triggered in the event of a Russian attack\u2026 I certainly wouldn't take for granted that the United States would ride to the rescue.\"\nAccording to polling by the French company Institut Elabe, nearly three quarters of French people now think that the United States is not an ally of France. A majority in Britain and a very large majority in Denmark, both historically pro-American countries, now have unfavourable views of the United States as well.\n\"The damage Trump has done to Nato is probably irreparable,\" argues Robert Kagan, a conservative commentator, author and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC who has been a long time critic of Trump.\n\"The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least\".\nAnd yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to get its defence spending in order. In 2016 Barack Obama urged Nato allies to increase theirs, saying: \"Europe has sometimes been complacent about its own defence.\"\nAll of this is great news for Putin. \"The entire system of Euro-Atlantic security is crumbling before our eyes,\" he said last year. \"Europe is being marginalised in global economic development, plunged into the chaos of challenges such as migration, and losing international agency and cultural identity.\"\nIn early March, three days after Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous meeting with Trump and Vance in the White House, a Kremlin spokesman declared \"the fragmentation of the West has begun\".\n\"Look at Russia's objectives in Europe,\" says Armida van Rij, head of the Europe programme at Chatham House. \"Its objectives are to destabilise Europe. It is to weaken Nato, and get the Americans to withdraw their troops from here.\n\"And at the moment you could go 'tick, tick and almost tick'. Because it is destabilising Europe. It is weakening Nato. It hasn't gone as far as to get the US to withdraw troops from Europe, but in a few months time, who knows where we'll be?\"\nOne of the great challenges Europe, in particular, faces from here is the question of how to arm itself adequately. Eighty years of reliance on the might of the United States has left many European democracies exposed. \nBritain, for example, has cut military spending by nearly 70% since the height of the Cold War. (At the end of the Cold War, in the early 1990s, Europe allowed itself a peace dividend and began a decades-long process of reducing defence spending.)\n\"We had a big budget [during the Cold War] and we took a peace dividend,\" says Wallace. \"Now, you could argue that that was warranted.\n\"The problem is we went from a peace dividend to corporate raiding. [Defence] just became the go-to department to take money from. And that is where we just forgot the lessons of our history.\"\nThe prime minister told parliament last month that Britain would increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027. But is that enough?\n\"It isn't enough just to stand still,\" argues Wallace. \"It wouldn't be enough to fix the things we need to make ourselves more deployable, and to plug the gaps if the Americans left.\"\nThen there is the wider question of military recruitment. \"The West is in freefall in its military recruiting, it's not just Britain,\" argues Wallace.\n\"At the moment, young people aren't joining the military. And that's a problem.\"\nBut Germany's new Chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has said Europe must make itself independent of the United States. And \"Europeanising\" NATO will require the build up of an indigenous European military-industrial complex capable of delivering capabilities that currently only the United States has.\nOthers share the view that Europe must become more self reliant militarily - but some are concerned that not all of Europe is on board with this.\n\"Where we are at the moment is that the East Europeans by and large, don't need to get the memo,\" says Ian Bond, deputy director, Centre for European Reform. \"The further west you go, the more problematic it becomes until you get to Spain and Italy.\"\nMr Arnold agrees: \"The view in Europe now is this isn't really a debate anymore, it's a debate of how we do it and maybe how quickly we do it, but we need to do this now.\"\nThere is a short list of \"very important things\" that only the United States currently provides, according to historian Timothy Garton Ash. \n\"These are the so-called strategic enablers,\" he says. \"The satellites, the intelligence, the Patriot air defence batteries, which are the only ones that can take down Russian ballistic missiles. And within three to five years we [countries other than the US] should aim to have our own version of these.\n\"And in this process of transition, from the American-led Nato [the idea is] you will have a Nato that is so Europeanised that its forces, together with national forces and EU capacities, are capable of defending Europe - even if an American president says 'leave us out of this'.\"\nThe question is how to achieve this.\nMs van Rij stresses that, in her view, Europe does need to build a Europe-owned European defence industrial base - but she foresees difficulties.\n\"What's really difficult are the divisions within Europe on how to actually do this and whether to actually do this.\"\nThe European Commission and experts have been trying to figure out how this defence may work for several decades. \"It has traditionally been very difficult because of vested national interests... So this is not going to be easy.\"\nIn the meantime, Trump appears ready to turn the page on the post-Cold War rules-based international order of sovereign states that are free to choose their own destinies and alliances.\nWhat he seems to share with Vladimir Putin is a desire for a world in which the major powers, unconstrained by internationally agreed laws, are free to impose their will on smaller, weaker nations, as Russia has traditionally done in both its Tsarist and Soviet Empires. That would mean a return to the \"spheres of interest\" system that prevailed for 40 years after the Second World War.\nWe don't know exactly what Donald Trump would do were a Nato country to be attacked. But the point is that the guarantee of US help can no longer be taken for granted. That means Europe has to react. Its challenge appears to be to stay united, finally make good on funding its own defence, and avoid being drawn into the \"sphere of influence\" of any of the big powers.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy.

        "article_text": "F1 cars, such as Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari, use 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrid engines\nChristian Horner's phone rang. It was Bernie Ecclestone. Red Bull's team principal picked up, switched to speakerphone and placed it on the table in front of the assembled Formula 1 bosses.\nWe're in the F1 Commission, Horner told Ecclestone. Is there anything you want to say to the room?\nF1's former impresario, addressing the group that decides the sport's rules, said they should go back to V10 engines. Then he hung up.\nThat phone call - described to BBC Sport by several sources in the room at the time - took place in the morning of the day of F1's season launch at the O2 Arena in London in February, where both Horner and governing body the FIA were booed by the 15,000-strong crowd.\nTwo days later, FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem - a man whose three-year tenure has been beset by controversy - posted a message on Instagram.\nBen Sulayem said he \"looked forward\" to the new chassis and engine rules that are  to be introduced in 2026, but that the FIA \"must also lead the way on future technological motorsport trends.\n\"We should consider a range of directions, including the roaring sound of the V10 running on sustainable fuel.\"\nThese developments have kick-started a debate inside F1 about engines. The ground is shifting fast, so what's going on?\nNext year, F1 is going through the biggest regulation change in the sport's history, introducing new rules for both cars and engines.\nOn engines, F1 is sticking with 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, the basic architecture that has been in place since 2014, but changing the balance between electric and combustion power.\nThe amount of total power provided by the hybrid is going up to about 50% from about 20% now. In addition, F1 is introducing sustainable fuels - abandoning fossil fuels in favour of synthetic fuel created from biomass and industrial processes.\nThis is all part of the sport's pledge to become net-zero carbon by 2030.\nThis video can not be played\nF1 in 10 Years: Lando Norris\nEver since hybrid engines were introduced in 2014, some have bemoaned the loss of the louder, more dramatic sound produced by the naturally aspirated engines that preceded them - especially the 3.0-litre V10s last raced in F1 in 2005.\nIn an unavoidable parallel with Ben Sulayem's actions now, Ecclestone was the first person to bring this up, even before the 2014 engines first raced.\nA certain romanticism about the V10 sound has sustained, as has the idea that those engines - with their ear-splitting shriek that could be heard some distance from the track - are more popular with the fanbase than the current hybrids.\nWithin F1, there is no question that some people agree. Lewis Hamilton said at the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend: \"It is no secret that the V6 has never sounded great.\n\"I remember the first time I came to an F1 race in 1996 in Spa and arriving and Michael (Schumacher) coming through Turn One and my rib cage just vibrated. I was so hooked. It was the most amazing thing I felt and heard.\n\"Over the years we've lost that. If we are able to move back to those amazing sounding engines and still able to see the sustainable goals, why not?\"\nFernando Alonso took his 2005 title-winning Renault R25 - with V10 engine - for a demonstration run on track before the 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nIt's not that long since Ben Sulayem was trumpeting his involvement in the introduction of the 2026 engine rules.\nThese were fundamentally settled under the previous FIA president Jean Todt, but there was inevitable wrangling and it got over the line only after Ben Sulayem took office.\nTwo years ago, he said the new engines were \"at the forefront of technological innovation, making the future of F1 more sustainable while maintaining the spectacular racing\".\nSo why the U-turn?\nBen Sulayem has asked his F1 single-seater director Nikolas Tombazis to look into the matter.\nTombazis said that the advent of\u00a0sustainable fuels could allow F1 to make the engines simpler and cheaper.\n\"That's why the president made the comments about V10 engines in '28 - or '29 or whatever - and so on,\" Tombazis said. \"And that is something we are evaluating with the manufacturers.\"\nSenior figures within F1 and the car manufacturers involved in the sport see many problems with the FIA's position.\nOn a macro level, the climate crisis is very real, and the global road-car industry is heading in the direction of electrification - even if Donald Trump's election at the head of a government of climate deniers has given pause for thought in the US.\nManufacturers take part in F1 fundamentally for marketing reasons, and the sport has been made more appealing by the introduction of a budget cap for cars and engines.\nAudi, Ford and General Motors are all entering F1 in 2026 - and Honda are staying rather than withdrawing - specifically because of the new engine rules.\nAudi has already released a statement in response to the latest developments, saying that the new rules \"were a key factor in Audi's decision to enter Formula 1\".\nMercedes says it is open to discussions but would need a hybrid element to be part of any new engine formula for it to remain interested.\nThen there is the micro level.\nWhy a V10? No major road-car manufacturer uses them any more.\nMercedes says a V8 would make more sense if a change was to be made, as at least they are still being developed for road use.\nAnd why abandon turbochargers, when many performance road cars - from Audi RS6s or Mercedes AMG C63s to McLaren and Ferrari hypercars - use them for very good reasons?\nCost? Yes, a V10 might be cheaper than a hybrid. But the manufacturers have already spent an estimated collective $400m on the new engines. They are not about to throw that away.\nAnd a new V10 would require developing, to the tune of hundreds of millions more.\nWeight? Yes, the hybrid engines make the cars heavier, largely because of the batteries needed. But the majority of the weight increase from 550kg or so in 2005 to about 800kg now is accounted for by advances in safety, such as the halo head-protection device.\nOn top of that, in 2013, cars started races with about 160kg of fuel. Now, it's about 100kg and it's expected to be about the same next year. Returning to naturally aspirated engines would mean a huge increase in fuel capacity - and weight.\nSustainability? The new fuels being introduced next year are not net-zero carbon. According to scientific standards, sustainable fuels reduce carbon emissions by a little above 80%.\nThat's a lot. But doubling the amount of fuel used by abandoning hybrid engines would mean a doubling of the carbon emissions produced by fuel.\nThe emissions from the cars themselves are minuscule in the big picture - F1's transport around the world is much more significant. Still, the symbolism matters.\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem are both said to be interested in a return to V10 engines\nIn F1, politics are always involved.\nIt has escaped the attention of few that Ben Sulayem's intervention came after the crowd at the O2 booed when the FIA logo was shown.\nThis is an election year at the FIA, and some believe Ben Sulayem may have raised the idea of V10s because he thinks it will be popular with certain demographics who support him.\nSo far, no candidate has put themselves forwards to oppose him, but there are whispers that there is a credible opponent in the wings.\nAt the same time, word is creeping out in F1 about the progress the various manufacturers are making with their 2026 engines. And it seems that Mercedes are leading the way.\nPeople are already beginning to say that a team will only win in 2026 if it has a Mercedes engine.\nOf course, there is no proof of this, but the whispers are emerging in exactly the same way as similar ones did in 2013 - and they were proved exactly right when the hybrid engines made their debut the following year.\nThe V10 proposal is seen by rival teams as very much a Horner-Ben Sulayem agenda, even if it is said to have some support from Ferrari.\nEven Horner, while saying that \"the concept of a V10 would be very exciting for the sport\" acknowledges that abandoning the rules would be \"a massive departure from what is being worked on very hard for 2026\".\nA U-turn for 2026 now would need support from the teams and manufacturers - and there is not a chance that enough of them would support that to get it through.\nA leading team boss told BBC Sport on condition of anonymity that there have been \"zero discussions\" of this idea in the group of F1 stakeholders.\nIt takes time - years - to agree engine rules.\nIt would probably be two years before a full agreement could be reached. Then the manufacturers would need the same time again to develop and build the engines. Which would take F1 to the end of 2029. Which is only a year before the new rules are due to expire anyway.\nAs one team boss puts it: \"I think this will all peter out, and it will just end up becoming: 'What will 2031 look like?'\"\nThe FIA says: \"There needs to be a consultation between all stakeholders to agree on a way forward, before we fully explore different scenarios.\n\"Whichever direction is chosen, we must support the teams and manufacturers in ensuring cost control on R&D expenditure and take account of environmental and sustainability considerations.\"\nAnd the chances of the end result being a naturally aspirated V10, in the context of all the above?

        "article_text": "There are few US presidential actions more sensitive, more fraught with peril, than when and where to use American military force.\nIf such information were obtained by American adversaries in advance, it could put lives \u2013 and national foreign policy objectives - at risk.\nFortunately for the Trump administration, a group chat with information about an impending US strike in Yemen among senior national security officials on the encrypted chat app Signal did not fall into the wrong hands.\nUnfortunately for the Trump administration, the message thread was observed by an influential political journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg.\nThe Atlantic Magazine editor-in-chief, in an article posted on Monday on his publication's website, says he appears to have been inadvertently added to the chat by White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz.\nMembers of the group seemed to include Vice-President JD Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, among others.\nA National Security Council spokesman told the BBC the text message thread \"appears to be authentic\".\nGoldberg says the group debated policy and discussed operational details about the impending US military strike \u2013 conversations that provided a rare near-real-time look at the inner workings of Trump's senior national security team.\n\"Amazing job,\" Waltz wrote to the group, just minutes after the US strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen took place on Saturday 15 March.\nHe followed up with emojis of a US flag, a fist and fire. Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.\nThese White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.\nThat an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.\nAnd that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.\n\"This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X.\nDemocratic congressman Chris Deluzio said in a press statement that the House Armed Services Committee, on which he sits, must conduct a full investigation and hearing on the matter as soon as possible.\n\"This is an outrageous national security breach, and heads should roll,\" he said.\nCriticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either.\nDon Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was \"unconscionable\".\n\"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,\" he said of Waltz's messaging. \"Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone.\"\nWith Republicans in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump's own party would have to initiate any kind of formal congressional investigation into the matter.\nRepublican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error.\n\"They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said. \"I don't know what else you can say about that.\"\nTrump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.\nThe White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz. \nBy Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.\nIn its afternoon statement, the White House noted that the strikes were \"highly successful and effective\". That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team.\nJD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen.\nWhile the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action.\nHe noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal.\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"\nThe vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\".\n\"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\nThis is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy.\nDick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky.\nThis is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines. Both Trump and Joe Biden were investigated for their possession of classified information after leaving office. Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for alleged violations related to his refusal to turn over material stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence \u2013 a case that was dropped when Trump won re-election last year.\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for communications while US secretary of state became a major issue during her unsuccessful presidential campaign.\nLike this White House group chat, some of those messages provided insight into the inner workings of Clinton's team.\nTheir revelation also proved to be politically damaging. A handful of her stored messages were later deemed to contain \"top secret\" information.\n\"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign \u2013 one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law.\nOn Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" she wrote.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team.Watch: Mike Johnson defends Trump administration after Yemen group chat mishapJD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen.While the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action.He noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal. \"Trump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.The White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz. \"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign \u2013 one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law.On Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal. Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.These White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.That an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.And that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.",

        "article_text": "Dr Alan Borthwick, softly spoken in his blazer and tie, looks every bit the typical historian.\nBut this archivist has spent the past 30 years solving a mystery.\nHow did thousands of historical documents that belong in Scotland's national archives end up across the Atlantic Ocean in Canada?\nThe answer is that they were stolen. By one man. With a particular interest in stamps.\nDr Borthwick explains that \"panic\" first set in when a National Records of Scotland (NRS) employee attended an auction in London in 1994.\nThey discovered that 200 of the items up for sale belonged to NRS.\nThese should have been safely in Scotland's archives, not being offloaded to the highest bidder via a bang of the auctioneer's gavel.\nNRS can date back all their archive users to 1847. After some cross referencing, Dr Borthwick and his team realised that the auction items all linked back to one person \u2013 Prof David Stirling Macmillan.\nProf Macmillan was born in 1925 and was from Girvan, Ayrshire. He served in the Royal Navy during World War Two and studied history at the University of Glasgow.\nHis right to use the national archives had been revoked in 1980 when he was caught removing a document. Staff assumed this was a one-off.\nBut the truth was that Prof Macmillan had been helping himself since 1949.\nThe 200 items that turned up in the London auction were the tip of the iceberg.\nNow National Records of Scotland are revealing the scale of his thefts. And the odd nature of them.\nProf Macmillan wasn't pinching documents that were worth a lot of money, or even those that were particularly historically significant.\nThe archives include letters from Robert Burns and Mary Queen of Scots. But these weren't his targets.\nThe contents of many of the letters he took are mundane, perhaps even boring.\nBut a lifelong interest in stamps and postmarks seem to have led to him taking letters that caught his eye. Including documents dating back to 1637.\nOne example was a letter from a Scot who'd moved to the island of Madeira, off the north west coast of Africa. In 1813 they wrote to a friend with some news and gossip. Not exactly explosive stuff.\nAnd yet Prof Macmillan ripped it out of the book it was stored in and pocketed it.\nWe can't be certain about the motivations involved, but the interesting postmark and wax seal on the document are thought to be what tempted the professor.\nThe thief went to great lengths to cover his tracks.\nHe would remove reference numbers from documents and sometimes replace what he had taken with forgeries.\nIronically, Prof Macmillan was himself a professional archivist. He held that role at the University of Sydney and even placed an appeal for historical papers in the university newspaper.\nThe man who spent years stealing documents stressed they would be \"properly looked after\" and bemoaned the fact the so much of history had been \"destroyed or lost\".\nThe academic moved to Trent University in Canada in 1968 and spent 20 years teaching history, though he still seems to have made annual visits to Scotland's archives. He died in 1987, leaving no immediate family.\nMuch of his collection then found its way into the archives of Trent University, where they remained for some time. They were catalogued and descriptions were put online.\nIn 2012. Dr Alan Borthwick was still trying to track down what had been taken. He realised that thousands of the Trent University items rightly belonged to NRS and other UK institutions.\nDr Borthwick was dispatched to North America to investigate.\nHe says he was amazed by the \"sheer quantity of documents\" he found that had been stolen by Prof Macmillan.\nThe chief executive of NRS, Alison Byrne, echoes this. She described the scale of Prof Macmillan's thefts as \"unprecedented\".\nShe only took up her role six months ago, and was appalled when she was filled in on the situation.\nSecuring the return of these documents was one thing. But finding their rightful home was arguably the bigger task.\nFor decades, Dr Borthwick and his team have been \"piecing together the jigsaw\", undertaking the painstaking process of finding the correct place for all of these stolen items.\nFor context, National Records of Scotland are the custodians of 38 million documents. \nThey have 80 kilometres of shelving \u2013 enough to stretch from Edinburgh to Glasgow.\nTheir archives are all about precision \u2013 every document has an exact home that makes locating it straightforward.\nThe team wanted to get each item that Prof Macmillan had taken brought back to its rightful place.\nFortunately, NRS \"daybooks\" show what he was signing out of the archives. But his attempts to cover his tracks and remove identifying marks complicated the challenge.\nNow National Records of Scotland say they have got almost everything back where it should be, ready to be pored over by a new generation of historians.\nBut, for Dr Borthwick, how does it feel to know that a fellow archivist so egregiously abused the trust that was put in him?\nThe historian labels it \"a kick in the teeth\". He's been trying to undo the damage done by Prof Macmillan for almost all of his working life.\nThat time could have been spent on other historical projects.\nBut Dr Borthwick reflects that there's a \"sense of satisfaction\" in solving the mystery of the missing documents.\nDocuments that, these days, are kept under the watchful eye of CCTV.",

As a kicking unit we wanted to go there and flash our talent, let the scouts know that we are there for a reason and on merit,\" said McNamee.  \n\"I wasn't overly focused on the numbers but more the process of kicking and making sure we came across well.\"\nThe pair know that being in the international class, they have to work just that little bit harder than their American peers to catch the scouts' eyes.\n\"You're definitely an underdog,\" said Bolger. \n\"There's a low expectation but then there is a really high ceiling.

I gauged myself against American lads and that gave me the confidence that what Tadhg was saying was right,\" added the Laois man.\n\"And I have great memories \u2013 two years playing college football in the States was a class experience. I played in front of 35,000 against Oregon State in the opening game of last season in a great atmosphere.\"\nAs Pro Day approaches, McNamee says they have taken much inspiration from Smyth and McAtamney's path to the big time this time last year.\n\"It was amazing to see someone could go from playing gaelic football to competing at the NFL Combine. Once I saw that I knew I had a skill that would transfer well if I was given time to prepare,\" the Ballyboden GAA goalkeeper added.\n\"Charlie was the trailblazer for me. He's incredible and confidence just radiates from him. \n\"He was the youngest in the group last year and to be able to come in and compete as well as he did at the Combine and Pro Day and then get signed... it's unbelievable he was able to do it.\"\nAs for making that same transaction from Gaelic to American football, both McNamee and Bolger have worked hard on mastering a different kicking technique, with both likening it to perfecting a golf swing.\n\"The sweet spot in the ball in Gaelic is lower than on a ball in American football,\" McNamee explained.  \n\"Initially, I started kicking the ball too low which meant it was over-rotating and getting no distance.  So it was adjusting my angle and swing and once I'd found where the sweet spot was I was able to introduce power into it and dive a bit deeper into the foot angle, follow through, aim and finish.  \n\"I don't really think about it now \u2013 it's more natural and I kick that ball like I've been doing it for years.  As my technique's improved, I've added distance and there's more to come.\"\nFor Bolger, it's about doing the hard work in the gym away from the field. \n\"Once I was at college I realised there was more to it than biceps curls and looking in the mirror. At Idaho State, I was in the gym with the heavy weights on my back every day. That has helped with my kicking distance.  \n\"A lot of it is mastering technique too, of course. You have to learn to keep swinging your leg the same and keep your technique.

And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.\nThe tariffs apply to steel and aluminium imported to the US, as well as to some other products from Mexico, Canada and China - prompting announcements of counter-measures from the latter two countries and the European Union. \nTrump has also announced tariffs on cars coming into the US which are due to come into effect on 3 April. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.\nEconomists have warned these tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers. \nThat's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.\nSo which things could become more expensive?\nThe US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade.\nMany US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.\nComponent parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.\nThe new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.\nAnderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.\nThe cost of the higher taxes is likely to be passed on to customers.\nAndrew Foran from TD Economics has said that disrupting trade flows through tariffs \"would come with significant costs\".\nHe argues that the \"uninterrupted free trade\" which has \"existed for decades\" in the car-making sector has lowered prices for consumers.\nPopular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.\nHowever, it's also possible that firms could decide to bring in less foreign beer.\nModelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now. \nThe picture is more complicated when it comes to spirits, which have been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. \nIndustry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\". \nThey argue that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".\nSo given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. \nThe bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in the US, Canada and Mexico.\nThe US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs. \nTrump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".\nHowever, the National Association of Home Builders urged the president to exempt building materials \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".\nThe industry group has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.\n\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.\nImports from the rest of the world could also be affected. \nOn 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production. \nFindings are due towards the end of 2025.\nThe \"most obvious\" household impact of a trade war with Canada would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.\nCanada's billion-dollar industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.\nThe majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.\n\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.\n\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.\nCanada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. \nAccording to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.\nWhile the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%. \nThe US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.\n\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.\nThat means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices. \nAvocados thrive in in the Mexican climate. \nNearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.\nThe US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.\nRelated dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive. \nAdditional reporting by Lucy Acheson",

I am sorry, it's my decision, and I accept that decision,\" said Crisafulli.\nThe government had toyed with plans to redevelop the Gabba - which was built in 1895 and has staged 67 men's Test matches - but those plans were scrapped following a 100-day review into planning for 2032.\nCricket, which is being held in Los Angeles in 2028 and is likely to be retained in 2032, could be played at the Gabba before the arena is torn down. \n\"Wouldn't it be amazing to see the Australian cricket team win gold at an Olympic final? The Gabba's swansong,\" Crisafulli said. \n\"The Gabba is at its end of life. It hasn't been well maintained, and we do need a stadium to host this great show, and there is an opportunity for legacy play.\"\nQueensland Cricket backed the plans, with chief executive Terry Svenson saying the arena had been a \"wonderful venue\" but its challenges were \"well documented\". \nA new 25,000-seater national aquatic centre will be built in Spring Hill near the main stadium, while a new 20,000-seater arena is planned near the main athletes village. \nThe rowing will be held in Queensland's Fitzroy River, which is known to host saltwater crocodiles but the government says the waters are safe.\n\"If it's good enough for central Queensland kids, I reckon it's good enough for Pierre from Paris,\" said Crisafulli. \nThe Brisbane Queensland Tennis Centre will receive significant upgrades in order to host tennis events. \nThe Gabba first staged a Test match in 1931 \nSpeaking to BBC World Service, ABC reporter Arianna Levy said the plans to build a stadium in Victoria Park are controversial because the site holds \"cultural significance\" to aboriginal people. \n\"It really has come as a political backflip.\" said Levy on Tuesday.\n\"It's been really polarising for a lot of the community here in Queensland.\n\"The main stadium in Victoria Park, which will host 63,000 seats, it's one of the few green sites across Brisbane and it holds cultural significance to the indigenous people of Brisbane, the Turrbal people. They call the place the Barrambin. \n\"It was a native camping ground and food-gathering place. It had First Nations people from across Queensland gather all over the place for corroboree, which is the traditional dance for First Nations people. \n\"There were protests today. There were communities that were against the development of the park to turn it into a stadium. We do imagine in the days to come there will be fallout from community groups and stakeholders that feel like this plan is not the best plan going forward.\"\n",

        "article_text": "Launching on Apple TV+, a new film industry satire co-created by and starring Seth Rogen nails the business \u2013 and features Martin Scorsese, Charlize Theron and others as themselves.\nA film studio head and his team of senior executives eagerly take their seats in a private screening room to watch the new Ron Howard movie for the first time. This is work for them, but they're also beside themselves with anticipation. \"I am so excited about watching this film!\" says the boss. It's going to be \"perfect\".\nMany critics have responded similarly to the series featuring this scene, Apple TV+'s film industry satire The Studio, which has generated major buzz before it even begins this week.\u00a0One reviewer has called it \"2025's best new show to date\". Another said it was\u00a0\"the most entertaining and spot-on depiction of Hollywood since Robert Altman's The Player\", hailing its \"stellar scripts and an ensemble of actors who are having an utter blast\". Yet another praises it as\u00a0\"a love letter to the art of filmmaking\". \nThe 10-part comedy stars Seth Rogen as Matt Remick, the beleaguered head of a struggling film\u00a0studio whose efforts to balance commercial viability with artistic integrity invariably cause problems. The\u00a0Studio\u00a0is sharp, funny, stylishly filmed and Rogen is a major draw in his own right, but another reason for the excitement surrounding the show is its extraordinary array of Hollywood A-listers playing themselves. They include, among others, Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Adam Scott, Olivia Wilde, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Anthony Mackie, Charlize Theron, Steve Buscemi, Ice Cube, Zac Efron and Dave Franco.\nEvan Goldberg, who co-created, co-directed and co-wrote the series with his childhood friend and long-time creative partner Rogen, says in the production notes for the show that, except for two who remain nameless, every actor or director they approached to play themselves was up for it: \"People's only real question was, 'What's my joke?' 'What do I get to do?'.\" The stars taking part do have some excellent jokes and several of these big names are sending themselves up mercilessly. If there was an Emmy for \"best sport\", Kravitz would be a shoo-in for her antics in one episode when she accidentally gets high on drugs.\u00a0\nRogen's Remick is an executive who has worked at the fictional Continental\u00a0Studios for 22 years. He's a movie nerd; the sort of cinephile who will bend your ear about the incredible funeral shot in 1960s political epic Soy Cuba or wax lyrical about the \"magical\" properties of real film stock. He relaxes by watching Goodfellas for the millionth time. He yearns to make the next Annie Hall or Rosemary's Baby. He loves being around actors and directors and is desperate for their approval but as a\u00a0studio\u00a0guy \u2013 a suit, a bean-counter \u2013 the creatives only ever want to keep him at arm's length. Instead of hanging out with Hollywood's coolest, he has to take meetings with the Rubik's Cube people and the Jenga people because Continental is focused on making trashy popcorn movies with \"known brands\".\u00a0\nWhen the Continental head is fired after a string of box office bombs, the unpredictable CEO, Griffin Mill (Bryan Cranston), selects Matt to replace her. Mill has secured the movie rights to Kool-Aid, the soft-drink mix. He reasons that if a Barbie film can make a billion dollars for Warner Bros, Matt should be able to make money from a movie about the Kool Aid man, the drink's animated marketing mascot. Matt sets to work in the belief that prestige films and box office hits are not mutually exclusive but in a world where TikTok trends dictate film-making decisions, he's quickly forced to question that ideal.\nHe has a major problem in that he can't square his admiration for cinema legends with the need to make hard-nosed business decisions. He can't bring himself to tell Ron Howard that the last act of his latest movie sucks. He can't break it to Martin Scorsese that the\u00a0studio\u00a0won't be making his script about cult leader Jim Jones.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Studio\u00a0is actually exactly the sort of show that a movie nut like Matt would love watching. There are enough easter eggs and in-jokes to delight the most knowledgeable of film fans. For example, the episode about Olivia Wilde making a neo-noir detective film which one character says \"sounds like a rip-off of Chinatown\" features several references to the Roman Polanski classic. The instalment that revolves around director Sarah Polley's attempt to capture an elaborate \"oner\" \u2013 a long, single shot \u2013 is itself cleverly shot to look like one long take; indeed, much of the series is shot in long takes, giving it a fly-on-the-wall feel. Griffin Mill is also the name of the main character in another Hollywood satire, Robert Altman's aforementioned 1992 film The Player.\u00a0\nIt was while rewatching beloved TV series during lockdown that Rogen had the idea for a series similar in tone and style to the hit 90s sitcom The Larry Sanders Show, which was set behind the scenes of a late-night talk show, but about the film industry rather than television. Rogen and Goldberg and the rest of the writing team (Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory and Frida Perez) drew on their own experiences in the business as fuel for the storylines. According to the production notes, key to Matt's character was Rogen and Goldberg's memory of a\u00a0studio\u00a0executive telling them: \"I got into this business because I love movies, and now my job is to ruin them\" \u2013 a line that has made it into the show almost unchanged.\nAnother classic show Rogen rewatched during lockdown was The Sopranos. Matt Remick does not have a huge amount in common with mob boss Tony Soprano but they do share one thing \u2013 a fear that they've arrived at the party too late. In the opening episode of The Sopranos, Tony, who has been suffering from panic attacks, tells his therapist of his \"work\": \"Lately, I've been feeling that I came in at the end. That the best is over.\" Similarly Matt worries that the golden age of cinema has passed. In episode one, he tells the boss he's replaced, Patty (Catherine O'Hara): \"I'm anxious, I'm stressed out, panicking pretty much all the time.\" The Continental office was built as a temple to cinema but, says Matt, \"it feels much more like tomb\". Matt's film-loving assistant Quinn (Chase Sui Wonders) thinks she's \"30 years too late\" to the industry.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 of the best TV shows to watch in March\n\u2022\u00a0This new WW2 TV drama is 'stunning'\n\u2022\u00a0How Snow White became 2025's most divisive film\nThe decline of cinema in the form of the old-school film\u00a0studios, as the streaming services become ever more successful, is an underlying theme throughout the series. There's a danger that Continental is going to be bought by Amazon. Ted Sarandos, the co-head of Netflix, has a cameo, stealing the limelight at an awards ceremony. An exasperated Scorsese wants Matt to give him back his script so he can go sell it to Apple \"the way I should have done in the first place\".\nOf course, the demise of Hollywood has been predicted almost since the first\u00a0studio\u00a0opened its doors. Legendary screenwriter Ben Hecht recalled walking around Hollywood in 1951 with David Selznick, the movie mogul who made Gone with the Wind, as Selznick insisted that movies were over and done with. \"Hollywood's like Egypt,\" he told Hecht. \"Full of crumbled pyramids. It'll never come back.\" And yet three quarters of a century later, it's still there. Several of The\u00a0Studio's exterior scenes pointedly frame the iconic Hollywood sign in the background of the shot.\nHecht had been lured to Hollywood from New York by his friend Herman Mankiewicz, the screenwriter of Citizen Kane, who telegraphed him to say: \"Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots.\"\nThe\u00a0Studio\u00a0leans into the notion that idiots are over-represented in Tinseltown. Matt's team \u2013 Quinn,\u00a0studio exec Sal Saperstein (Ike Barinholtz), and marketing maven Maya Mason (Kathryn Hahn) \u2013 are all lovable dolts. Griffin Mill is a lunatic of the first order.\nBut Hollywood has always been happy to poke fun at itself. Barton Fink (1991), The Player and Get Shorty (1995) are among the hits that have sent up Tinseltown. HBO's show Entourage satirised the industry and The\u00a0Studio\u00a0comes hard on the heels of another HBO series, The Franchise, about the making of a Marvel Cinematic Universe-style movie. However, The Franchise, although hilarious, was scathing and it was cancelled after just one season. It's difficult to know exactly why it failed to connect with a large enough audience although one reviewer found the show's \"constant cynicism\" very wearing. In contrast, The\u00a0Studio\u00a0is affectionate. It has us rooting for Matt and Continental and maybe even for film-making as an artistic endeavour.\u00a0\nAfter all, as Patty tells Matt: \"One week you're looking your idol in the eye and breaking his heart and the next week you're writing a blank cheque for some entitled nepo baby in a beanie.

The one with the highest revenue, or the greatest social media following? The biggest stadium, or the best average league position? Or perhaps it's a happy medium of all those things.\nMost importantly, it's a debate nobody can win, one we all have a different take on and will all be offended by no matter how convincing someone's argument may be.\nTo bring the most unserious of serious topics to life, BBC Sport recently asked about 250 of its staff across the UK to take on the unanswerable question.\nThere were a lot of arguments. And a lot of unhappy people.\nBut at the end we averaged out the lists and came up with a top 10 below.\nAgree with it?

Their six Premier League titles - including a record four in a row - means their average league position sits at an impressive 1.7.\nAs for the chasing pack, there's barely anything to separate Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea in their respective average finishing positions.\nWest Ham, Everton and Crystal Palace are in having consistently finished mid-table over the years.\nHaving spent one year in the Championship, many might be surprised to see Leicester City inside the top 10.

        "article_text": "Oscar Piastri converted pole position to win the Chinese Grand Prix, as McLaren made it two wins from two races at the start of the season.\nLando Norris finished second to make it a McLaren one-two, with George Russell's Mercedes completing the top three.\nFerrari's Lewis Hamilton won the sprint race on Saturday but he and team-mate Charles Leclerc were both disqualified from the main grand prix.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions after the race in Shanghai.\nHow long do you think Red Bull will give Liam Lawson to get up to speed before contemplating a switch? - Jon\nIt rather looks as if their patience has already run out. Red Bull are to discuss Lawson's future this week, and there is a strong possibility he will be dropped for the next race in Japan.\nIf they go through with it, it will be regarded as a quite remarkable decision, which raises serious questions about the management at Red Bull Racing.\nTo understand why, let's rewind.\nIn May last year, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a two-year contract taking him to the end of 2026.\nThis was despite the fact that the Mexican was struggling as Max Verstappen's team-mate, and that the 2024 season looked to be going the same way as the year before - a bright start from Perez, and then an alarming slump in form.\nHorner could have brought in Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. But he remembered the tension between the Sainz and Verstappen camps when they were team-mates at Toro Rosso in 2015 and decided he did not want go there again.\nRe-signing Perez, Horner's theory went, would give him the confidence to recover his form.\nThe strategy failed spectacularly. Perez's performances fell off a cliff, and the team slumped to third in the constructors' championship despite Verstappen winning a fourth world title by 63 points.\nVerstappen only won twice in the final 14 races of the year because the car lost competitiveness and became difficult to drive. Hence Perez's struggles.\nBut Horner and Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko decided that Perez had had his day and they needed to make a change.\nThey paid him off - to the tune of many millions of dollars - and signed Lawson.\nThey picked the New Zealander over his much more experienced team-mate at the junior Racing Bulls team, Yuki Tsunoda, because they believed he had a mental toughness the Japanese lacked.\nLawson has had a dire start to the season. He qualified 18th at the season-opener in Melbourne, where he crashed out of the race, and last in both the sprint and grand prix in China, failing to make much progress in either event.\nBut Verstappen is also struggling - at least relatively. He is not hiding his belief that the car is the slowest of the top four teams - indeed he implied pretty strongly in China that he believed it may not be as fast as the Racing Bull.\nThe Red Bull is nervous on corner entry, has mid-corner understeer and is snappy on exits. And the team don't seem to know how to fix it.\nVerstappen likes a sharp front end, but he doesn't want the car to behave like this. But he can cope, and get a lap time out of it. Lawson cannot, at least not yet.\nLawson was talking in China as if he already knew the writing was on the wall.\n\"It's just (got) a very small window,\" he said. \"It's hard, you know \u2013 it's hard to drive, to get it in that window. I'd like to say that with time that'll come \u2013 I just don't have time to do that. It's something I need to get on top of.\"\nIf Red Bull drop him after two races, the management will have some serious explaining to do.\nIf signing him was the right decision in December, why is it the wrong decision now, they will be asked. If Tsunoda is the driver replacing him, the question becomes even starker.\nAnd if instead they choose Frenchman Isack Hadjar, who has impressed as Tsunoda's rookie team-mate in the first two grands prix, well, that's surely too early.\nEqually, if the first-order problem is the car - as it seems to be - why blame the driver?\nFor many in F1 there is an aphorism that sums up Red Bull's approach to their second seat: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\nLiam Lawson finished 12th in the Chinese Grand Prix, eight positions and nearly 55 seconds behind Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen\nAre Ferrari at fault for the double disqualification, or was it just unlucky and out of their control? \u2013 Ozan\nFormula 1 lives on the edge. To win, teams have to push their cars as close to the limit of the technical regulations as possible - because that is what everyone is doing.\nThe line between success and failure is so fine. And weight and ride height are two of the key performance differentiators.\nOne kilogram of extra weight in F1 costs approximately 0.035secs a lap. Multiply that by the 56 laps of the Chinese Grand Prix, for example, and it's two seconds of race time. Not a lot, but it could be the difference between winning and not, or one place higher or lower.\nThat's just to explain why cars are run to the edge. And when you run to the edge, mistakes can happen.\nIn the case of Ferrari on Sunday, Charles Leclerc's car was found to be 1kg underweight.\nFerrari ascribed this to the fact that they had switched to a one-stop strategy, so the car finished the race with less rubber on the tyres than had they run the expected two-stop, and that was the difference between being over the minimum weight limit and under.\nOf course, other teams also switched to a one-stop, without ending up underweight. But exactly the same thing happened to Mercedes with George Russell in Belgium last year when he was disqualified from victory.\nAs for Lewis Hamilton, his skid blocks had worn too much. Again, it's the sort of thing that can happen - indeed, it happened to Hamilton when he was at Mercedes in the 2023 US Grand Prix, and Leclerc in the same race.\nAgain, it's about pushing the margins. Generally with these current cars, the lower they can be run, the more downforce they can create, as long as teams can keep the aerodynamics stable.\nBut run them too low, and they risk wearing the floor excessively - and that's what happened.\nThese things are generally not deliberate. They are just what can happen when pushing performance to the edge.\nAside from the McLaren, who has impressed you the most at this very early stage? \u2013 SJM\nRacing Bulls have had a very strong start to the season. Tsunoda qualified fifth in Australia, and his team-mate Hadjar was seventh on the grid and Tsunoda ninth in China.\nThe races have gone a bit wrong so far, but the car looks strong - in China, Verstappen was even implying it was better than the Red Bull.\nRacing Bulls use a fair few Red Bull parts but since Red Bull have started struggling that is not necessarily the boost it was in theory a year or two ago, when the close relationship between the two teams was causing concern among rivals.\nIn the cockpit, Hadjar, notwithstanding his crash on the formation lap in Australia, has made a strong first impression.\nOverall, a very positive start to the year by the second Red Bull team.\nRacing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda both finished the Chinese Grand Prix but outside of the points\nHow was there such a big gap between Lewis Hamilton's sprint pace and qualifying pace? Or how did the other drivers close the gap in such a short space of time? \u2013 Ash\nThere is a combination of reasons. Ferrari hit the ground running in China and landed on a decent set-up for sprint qualifying in the single practice session before it.\nOn top of that, Hamilton put in a brilliant performance on a track where he has always excelled to take pole.\nBut there was an element of underachievement from other teams involved.\nThe McLaren was the fastest car in China and Oscar Piastri was more comfortable in it than Lando Norris. Both made mistakes in sprint qualifying - so they ended up third and sixth on the grid.\nHamilton converted pole into a lead at the first corner and then used the benefit of free air to maximise his opportunity.\nHe drove superbly, but he was protected from Piastri for much of the race by Verstappen, who the Australian did not pass until four laps from the end, by which time Hamilton had built a lead too big to overhaul.\nThe teams can change their set-ups after the sprint and it looks as if, by the time of grand prix qualifying, a more natural order emerged.\nAs Hamilton put it: \"We had a pretty decent car in the sprint, and then we made some changes to try and move forward and improve the car, but it made it quite a bit worse, basically, going into qualifying - and then it was even worse in the race.\"\nAmong those changes seems to have been lifting the car slightly, which Hamilton more or less confirmed after the race: \"I don't know who said we lifted the car, but we made some other changes, mostly, as well as that, but not massively, just small amounts.\"\nThey did not work - team-mate Leclerc was faster than Hamilton in the grand prix even though he had a damaged front wing. And the changes were not enough to stop Hamilton's car wearing the skid blocks too much. Hence his disqualification.\nThrow in Leclerc's disqualification for his car being underweight and it was a bad day at the office for Ferrari.\nWhy do teams put a board out from the pit wall as the drivers go through; surely all information is passed by the radio or telemetry? \u2013 Phil\nPit boards are there to give non-essential information relating to the drivers - primarily laps remaining. The gap to the drivers in front and behind are often also included.\nThey're also there as a back-up in case the radio fails.\nIt is, to a degree, a hangover from the past. But it's also simple and effective and there is no reason to stop doing it and plenty of reasons to continue.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\n'McLaren the class of the field but have hard tightrope to walk'\nObituary: Eddie Jordan, the flamboyant deal-maker of Formula 1\nChinese Grand Prix Review\nEddie Jordan Tribute",

And when you run to the edge, mistakes can happen.In the case of Ferrari on Sunday, Charles Leclerc's car was found to be 1kg underweight.Ferrari ascribed this to the fact that they had switched to a one-stop strategy, so the car finished the race with less rubber on the tyres than had they run the expected two-stop, and that was the difference between being over the minimum weight limit and under.Of course, other teams also switched to a one-stop, without ending up underweight.",

        "article_text": "President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a buoyant mood when I met him in Paris with a panel of three other European journalists. He had interrupted a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and went back there for what he called a \"t\u00eate \u00e0 t\u00eate dinner\" after the interview. \nMacron had not just rolled out the red carpet for him. The Eiffel Tower, behind Zelensky in a picture window as we talked in one of Paris's great museums, was lit up in yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag.\nThe French wanted him to feel as if he was among friends. Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the \"coalition of the willing\", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire.\nZelensky's welcome in Paris was a clear contrast to the dressing down he was given by US President Donald Trump and his vice president JD Vance when he visited the White House last month. \nAfter their verbal attack, Zelensky was unceremoniously turfed out of the White House and not long afterwards Trump ordered the suspension of American military aid and intelligence to Ukraine.\nIt was restored after Zelensky, advised by the British, the French and other European allies, went out of his way to mend his fences with Trump and his administration. \nHe switched to the kind of flattering language Trump demands and agreed to an American plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.  He dropped his insistence on US security guarantees first, to underpin any ceasefire.\nBut even though US military and intelligence assistance is flowing, Trump's ruthless suspension of it, which cost Ukrainian lives, has left a deep sense of unease in Ukraine and among its European allies. \nThe evidence is piling up that Trump's United States is not a reliable ally. It is getting easier to sketch out scenarios in which it might not be an ally at all. \nMost European leaders still try to act publicly as if the 80-year-old alliance with the US is healthy. But the gathering of 30 countries in Paris shows they realise they can no longer rely on the benevolence of the United States. \nAmerican presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s have complained, with good reason, about Europeans getting a free ride from the US security blanket over Europe. Trump has finally pulled it away.\nDuring the interview, Zelensky praised the array of plans that are being formulated in western Europe \u2013 led by the UK, France and Germany \u2013 to spend more on defence. \nHe suggested that in three to five years, \"if everything goes as it is now\", Europe might even catch up with the United States. \nAt best, that is a highly optimistic estimate, less an accurate forecast and more a gesture of appreciation for European allies who unlike the Americans attach very few conditions and strings to support for Ukraine.\nEurope, Zelensky said, \"has discipline and no chaos\". That might be seen as an oblique and unflattering comparison with the twists and turns coming out of the Trump White House.\n\nI asked him about the conditions Russia's President Vladimir Putin has attached to the latest small step in the Trump peace initiative, which is a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea. \nAfter Ukraine and Russia held separate meetings with the Americans in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin issued a statement that required concessions as Russia's price for a ceasefire. \nThe most significant demand was for a state-owned Russian bank to be readmitted to the Swift system for international payments. That would open a door back into mainstream global commerce for Russia. \nThat decision does not depend on Trump, as Swift is based in Belgium. \nThe European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the \"main preconditions\" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was \"the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine\".\nEven Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be \"dragging its feet\" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career. \nHe told the US cable channel Newsmax that \"I've done it over the years\u2026 I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game.\"\n\nI asked Zelensky where the push for a ceasefire stood, given Russia's demands. He called for a resolute response from the Americans.\n\"If America is going to stand strong and not bend to the conditions of the Russians - we stand on our land. \n\"We are defending it; we have shown our resilience to everyone\u2026 And now it's very important that our partners would be resilient and strong, at least at the minimum, as we are.\"\nI asked whether he believed the Americans would, as he put it, stay strong.\n\"I hope so. I hope so. God bless they will. But we'll see.\"\nZelensky has no choice about stating his faith in Trump's America, even though he must have grave doubts. \nTrump's decision to punish Ukraine by cutting off military intelligence about Russia missile launches had an immediate and deadly impact, and Zelensky had to work hard to get Trump to relent. He does not want it to happen again.\nHe was open about why he had to try to stay close to Trump, even as the US president seemed to be prioritising the restoration of relations with Moscow as he repeated Russian propaganda points, not least the lie that Ukraine started the war.\n\"We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important.\"\n\nThat did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war. \nIn an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the \"coalition of the willing\" to support Ukraine. \nThe American said it was a posture and pose, \"a simplistic desire\" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States. \nWhat if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries.\nZelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda.\n\"I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives\u2026 I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives.\"\nZelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan.\n\"He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different.\"\n\nPresident Zelensky, for a man who has lived with immense pressure since Russia's full scale invasion more than three years ago, was remarkably buoyant, clearly pleased by the reception he had in Paris and the efforts that President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer are making to rally European support and to persuade, even cajole,  Trump not to cut intelligence and military support to Ukraine. \nZelensky seemed happy with his new strategy of agreeing to temporary ceasefires to force Putin to show his reluctance to pause the war.\nI asked Zelensky how he was dealing with the pressure. His goal, he said, was for his children to be able \"to walk down the street and not have to hide.\" And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people.\n\"He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears.\"\nZelensky laughed.\n\"And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin.\"\nTrump might be hoping for a deal by Easter. Zelensky is still looking to the long haul.",

        "article_text": "An intriguing sequel to the tale of Merlin has sat unseen within the bindings of an Elizabethan deeds register for nearly 400 years. Researchers have finally been able to reveal it with cutting-edge techniques.\nIt is the only surviving fragment of a lost medieval manuscript telling the tale of Merlin and the early heroic years of King Arthur's court.\nIn it, the magician becomes a blind harpist who later vanishes into thin air. He will then reappear as a balding child who issues edicts to King Arthur wearing no underwear.\nThe shape-shifting Merlin \u2013 whose powers apparently stem from being the son of a woman impregnated by the devil \u2013 asks to bear Arthur's standard (a flag bearing his coat of arms) on the battlefield. The king agrees \u2013 a good decision it turns out \u2013 for Merlin is destined to turn up with a handy secret weapon: a magic, fire-breathing dragon.\u00a0\nFor over 400 years, this fragile remnant of a celebrated medieval story lay undisturbed and unnoticed, repurposed as a book cover by Elizabethans to help protect an archival register of property deeds.\nNow, the 700-year-old fragment of Suite Vulgate du Merlin \u2013 an Old French manuscript so rare there are less than 40 surviving copies in the world \u2013 has been discovered by an archivist in Cambridge University Library, folded and stitched into the binding of the 16th-Century register.\nUsing groundbreaking new technology, researchers at the library were able to digitally capture the most inaccessible parts of the fragile parchment without unfolding or unstitching it. This preserved the manuscript in situ and avoided irreparable damage \u2013 while simultaneously allowing the heavily faded fragment to be virtually unfolded, digitally enhanced and read for the first time in centuries.\nPreviously, it was catalogued as the story of Gawain. \"It wasn't properly inventoried,\" says Irene Fabry-Tehranchi, the French specialist at the library. \"No one had even recorded that it was in French.\"\nWhen she and her colleagues realised the fragment told a story about Merlin and his ability to change shape \"we were really excited,\" she says.\nThe Suite Vulgate du Merlin was originally written around 1230, a time when Arthurian romances were particularly popular among noblewomen, although the fragment is from a lost copy dated to around 1300. \"We don't know who wrote the text,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi. \"We think it was probably a collaborative exercise.\"\nIt is positioned as a sequel to an earlier text, written around 1200, in which Merlin is born a child prodigy gifted with foresight and casts a spell to facilitate the birth of King Arthur, who proves his divine right to rule by pulling the sword from the stone.\n\"The Suite Vulgate du Merlin tells us about Arthur's early reign, his relationship with the knights of the round table and his heroic fight with the Saxons. It really shows Arthur in a positive light \u2013 he's this young hero who marries Guinevere, invents the Round Table and has a good relationship with Merlin, his advisor,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi.\nIt is thanks to the sequel, she says, that the story of the Holy Grail \u2013 and Merlin's place in that story \u2013 could be retold in a coherent way from beginning to end. \"If the sequel was written to facilitate that, it was successful. That became the main way the story was transmitted.\"\nStylistic evidence in the text indicates the fragment was written by an unknown scribe in a northern French dialect understood by English aristocrats. \"These are Celtic and English legends, which had circulated orally across the British Isles. But the language used when they are written down is Old French, because of the Norman Conquest.\"\nBy the 16th Century, however, Old French had fallen out of favour in England. \"There was a linguistic shift to English among readers of Arthurian literature,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi. This may be why the fragment ended up as the book binding of an archival register: \"The text had lost its appeal, so they wanted to reuse it.\"\nThe library wanted to preserve the register, which was created in 1580 to record the property of Huntingfield Manor in Suffolk, as evidence of 16th-Century archival binding practices in England.\nPreviously, it would have been necessary to cut this binding to access the parts of the folded fragment, and the heavily faded areas of the texts would have remained illegible.\nToday, multispectral imaging (MSI), CT scanning and 3D modelling has enabled scholars to not only read the faded and hidden texts of the fragment, but to understand exactly how it was folded and sewn into the register. The Cultural Heritage Imaging Laboratory team at Cambridge University Library has even been able to analyse the different threads used by the Elizabethan bookbinders and the different decoration pigments used by the medieval illuminator,\u00a0 whose job it was to \"illuminate\" manuscripts with decorative illustrations and rich colours.\nDown in the basement of the library, in a small photographic studio dominated by a multispectral camera that cost over \u00a3100,000 ($125,000), the lab's chief photographic technician Am\u00e9lie Deblauwe says: \"The specialist imaging techniques that were employed on the Merlin fragment revealed details that would not be visible to the naked eye.\"\nThe camera takes 49 images of each page using different combinations of light panels emitting different wavelengths of light into both sides of the paper. Starting with invisible ultraviolet light, it moves right through the visible spectrum \u2013 \"all the colours of the rainbow\" \u2013 to invisible infrared light, she says. \"All of these are measured in nanometres. So we very accurately know what we are doing to the page with these lights, we are really in control of what we're bombarding it with.\"\nUsing a range of light colour bands meant that even the tiniest residue of ink, which had chemically degraded over time, could be made to stand out clearly in images. Technicians made the writing more legible by processing the image data using geospatial and open source software. \"That's because different inks and different papers react differently to different lights,\" Deblauwe says. While some lights are absorbed by the parchment and the ink, others are deflected, illuminating different details.\u00a0\nThe camera can even reveal tiny scratches on the parchment by sending light towards the paper at different angles, creating \"surface shadows\". \"We call it 'raking light',\" says Deblauwe.\nAn unexpected discovery came when the images revealed that the parchment was significantly lighter in the middle. \"That was an amazing moment for me,\" says Deblauwe. \"It was a little bit noticeable in the colour image, but it became really apparent in the MSI.\"\nAfter she saw these images, she realised the parchment was also shinier in the middle and had a waxier feel to it. This indicates that a leather strap had probably once been tied around the middle of the book to hold it together more firmly and, over time, rubbed some of the parchment's fibres away. \"Sometimes you have a bit of a lightbulb moment, and that gives you a greater understanding of the history of the item,\" says Deblauwe. \"This is next level study of manuscript material.\"\nOne of the \"trickiest\" challenges the team faced was how to access the text hidden by folds,\u00a0 says Fabry-Tehranchi. The solution was for conservators to carefully handle the parchment while technicians inserted a \"very narrow\" macro probe lens into the darkest crevices of the hidden areas via any part of the parchment that was still accessible.\u00a0\n\"The lens can get very close to an object,\" says chief photographic technician B\u0142a\u017cej W\u0142adys\u0142aw Miku\u0142a. \"We take multiple shots, and we stitch the images together.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The book with 1,300-year-old doodles\n\u2022 A map of the ocean may be in reach\n\u2022 The Shakespeare play lost since 1603\nThe result was hundreds of images of Old French words and letters \u2013 all handwritten by a medieval scribe \u2013 which needed to be put together like a jigsaw. To add a further layer of complexity, some of the images were taken using mirrors to reflect otherwise inaccessible areas of the text, so the images were curved or needed to be rotated or flipped.\nFiguring out where a particular image belonged was a painstaking process, but it was ultimately very satisfying, says Fabry-Tehranchi. Only a few square centimetres of the text remain unseen, due to the placement of the thread, but otherwise the fragment has been forced to give up all its secrets.\u00a0\nUsing a CT scanner, which can distinguish between different materials, the team was even able to digitally remove the thread from the spine of the book in a new process which allowed the stitches and materials used by the Elizabethan bookbinders to be analysed. \"We never knew that we would obtain such a good quality image of the structure of the binding,\" says Fabry-Tehranchi. \"It's amazing.\"\nMiku\u0142a sometimes wonders what these Elizabethans would have made of all his efforts to analyse the fragment. \"They saw it as a piece of rubbish. It could never have crossed their minds what we would do to it.\" He suspects there may be other such manuscripts out there. \"This library is full of treasure that needs to be discovered.\"\n* Digitisation, analysis and edition of the medieval French fragment of the story of Merlin re-discovered at Cambridge University Library, a free talk by Ir\u00e8ne Fabry-Tehranchi, Am\u00e9lie Deblauwe and B\u0142a\u017cej W\u0142adys\u0142aw Miku\u0142a, will take place at 5pm on 26 March during the Cambridge Festival.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

All very England when it comes to qualifiers - as it should be against a country ranked between Burundi and the Dominican Republic on Fifa's list.\nEze scores first England goal as Three Lions beat Latvia \nWho can be 'a real asset'? England player ratings v Latvia\nEngland labour to Latvia win in World Cup qualifying\nReece James (centre) scored a superb free-kick on his first international start since September 2022\nThis is not, it must be stressed, a criticism of Tuchel, whose tenure in its infancy.\nIt is simply a confirmation that providing the sort of thrill ride the German coach wants to serve up for England fans is easier said than done in these types of games with this team, and there is no quick fix to change that.\nIf Tuchel thought he could quickly blow away the cobwebs he believed had gathered on Southgate's England, then his first two games in charge will have been a sobering dose of reality.\nThere has been little, so far, to distinguish Tuchel's team from the one that went before it.\nFor long periods this was a deadly dull England performance. \nTuchel, in some respects, has made a rod for his own back with his deeply unflattering review of the Three Lions' efforts in Germany last summer and his talk of change.\nEngland did do some of the things their new boss demanded. He wants more touches in the opposition box - and that figure more than doubled from his first game against Albania, increasing from 34 on Friday to 69 against Latvia.\nThey put in 36 crosses on a night when they enjoyed 73.5% possession, but the end product was poor. Marcus Rashford improved slightly on his performance against Albania, but Jarrod Bowen could not make the desired impact as a replacement for struggling Phil Foden.\nEngland sent in 21 of those crosses in the first half, the most in a game since they played Poland in October 2013 and delivered 25 - but their only goal game from James' free-kick.\nIn a sign of England's complete domination, they had 569 successful passes in Latvia's half compared to the visitors' 26 in theirs, and must be disappointed such overwhelming statistics resulted in relatively meagre results.\nTuchel wants to give England a fresh identity as they try to cross the psychological barrier from a nearly team to winners, but - as so often in the past - the acid test will only truly come when (it is hardly if) they qualify for the 2026 World Cup.\nQualifying should be a formality from a group that also contains Andorra and Serbia, so the first high-quality opponents England are likely to meet will be when they get to the World Cup. \nIt is a situation they have been in before - and then been found wanting when it matters.\nWho makes your England World Cup starting XI?\n'We will get there' - who were winners & losers for Tuchel's England?\nJude Bellingham was fortunate not to receive a second yellow card for a reckless challenge on Raivis Jurkovskis\nThis a problem for Tuchel to solve and one he will be well aware of.\nBut the 51-year-old will have enjoyed the spectacular strike from James, a player he greatly admires and who was a vital part of his Chelsea team that won the Champions League in 2021.\nKane's second was also right up the head coach's street, with Declan Rice accelerating into the Latvia area, collecting Morgan Rogers' pass and drilling a ball across the face of the six-yard box which left his captain with a simple finish.\nWhat will cheer Tuchel is that he has plenty of raw materials to work with.\nBellingham, for all the impetuosity that could - and should - have seen him sent off on Monday, is a generational talent, while Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly has demonstrated he is a natural at this level.\nThere was more good news from The Hawthorns where another Gunner, Ethan Nwaneri, excelled in a goalscoring performance for England Under-21s - and the return of a third Arsenal player, Bukayo Saka, will offer an added attacking dimension.\nTuchel's task is to find the \"X Factor\", the missing ingredient, to get England's men over the line they have failed to cross since the 1966 World Cup.\nTwo wins from two games is a satisfactory - and totally expected - opening to the Tuchel era, but now he must discover the missing link to enable him to deliver the exciting England side he has promised.\nAnd on the somewhat tedious evidence of his first two games, Tuchel will have plenty to exercise his mind between now and the next international camp in June.",

The one with the highest revenue, or the greatest social media following? The biggest stadium, or the best average league position? Or perhaps it's a happy medium of all those things.\nMost importantly, it's a debate nobody can win, one we all have a different take on and will all be offended by no matter how convincing someone's argument may be.\nTo bring the most unserious of serious topics to life, BBC Sport recently asked about 250 of its staff across the UK to take on the unanswerable question.\nThere were a lot of arguments. And a lot of unhappy people.\nBut at the end we averaged out the lists and came up with a top 10 below.\nAgree with it? Of course you don't.\nNo doubt many of you will feel enraged at where your club has ended up. So please, all we ask is that you remember a) this is an average and there were lots of different versions b) we're not saying we're right c) you can leave your top 10 below and d) it's just a bit of fun.\nManchester United\nLiverpool\nArsenal\nManchester City\nCeltic\nChelsea\nTottenham Hotspur\nRangers\nAston Villa\nNewcastle United\nIn an attempt to be more scientific, we have also taken a look at certain factors in isolation to see which clubs lead the way.\nTraditionally, clubs are deemed big if they win things.\nWhen it comes to major trophies, Glasgow giants Celtic and Rangers lead the way with significantly more silverware than any side in the English game.\nLiverpool are the most successful club in England, with Manchester United a close second - and the Reds look likely to equal United's record 20 top-flight titles this season.\nThey also have more European trophies than any other English side while Arsenal have the leading FA Cup tally.\nManchester City's recent dominance has shot them up the rankings, winning six of the past seven Premier League titles and securing a historic Treble in 2022-23.\nOf course, trophies are subjective and it might be that you think European titles are bigger than domestic ones or vice versa.\nSome of the more traditional among you may disregard social media followings as a bit of a gimmick.\nBut it does give us a good indication of just how big a reach clubs have not just in this country but globally, as well as their ability to engage fans.\nManchester United have the highest combined social media following across the four major platforms, while some clubs fare better on individual platforms.\nManchester City have a lower combined social following than their city rivals but fare better on Tik Tok while Tottenham are sixth overall but have the best Tik Tok following of any club.\nThe traditional 'top six' occupy the top spots but Leicester City's title win in 2015-16 boosted their profile globally and puts them seventh in the ranking.\nIs it really all about the money? If you think it is, Manchester City are the standout candidate.\nAccording to Deloitte's Money League study, City earned the most revenue in 2023-24 of any English club with \u00a3708m, second only in the world to Spanish giants Real Madrid.\nNine Premier League clubs featured in the world's top 20 with a further five in the top 30 as Brighton moved up the rankings after competing in the Europa League for the first time.\nIf big club means big stadium to you then it's Manchester United who sit top of the pile.\nWembley is currently the largest, with a 90,000 capacity but Old Trafford is the biggest club stadium and United have also also announced plans to build an arena bigger than Wembley - a new \u00a32bn 100,000-seater ground close to it.\nEverton's new Bramley Moore Dock stadium will be ranked seventh in the top 10 once it is in use from next season with a capacity of 52,888 while Manchester City are undergoing an expansion that will increase Etihad Stadium's capacity to 61,474.\nThough Queen's Park play their home matches at Hampden Park, which has a capacity in excess of the Stadium of Light, the ground is not fully open for Scottish Championship matches, with an average crowd this season of less than 2,000.\nWhen it comes to football, consistency is key.\nAnd that's exactly what Manchester City have been over the past 10 years. Their six Premier League titles - including a record four in a row - means their average league position sits at an impressive 1.7.\nAs for the chasing pack, there's barely anything to separate Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea in their respective average finishing positions.\nWest Ham, Everton and Crystal Palace are in having consistently finished mid-table over the years.\nHaving spent one year in the Championship, many might be surprised to see Leicester City inside the top 10.

        "article_text": "Jay Springett, a tech strategist and podcast host, joined the social media app Butterflies AI out of curiosity, and ended up staying for more than six months.\nThe idea of Butterflies is to allow human and AI personas to interact.\nMr Springett's online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection.\nHe said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation.\n\"I didn't engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,\" Mr Springett told BBC.\n\"It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn't pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching.\"\nA host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants.\nAccording to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X's daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024.\nAnd it's not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb.\nA report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago.\nBluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.\nOver the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.\nApart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.\nUnlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.\nDon't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.\nIt will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.\nHe ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".\nCelebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.\nIt's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.\n\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".\nA bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.\nThe law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.\nNon-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.\nThey hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services. \nInstead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.\nThreads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.\nUsing this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.\nIt's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.\nBut there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.\n\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.\nAt the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.\nIn the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.\nOne of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.\nInstead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.\n\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.\nMike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.\nHe hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.\n\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

        "article_text": "Oscar Piastri converted pole position to win the Chinese Grand Prix, as McLaren made it two wins from two races at the start of the season.\nLando Norris finished second to make it a McLaren one-two, with George Russell's Mercedes completing the top three.\nFerrari's Lewis Hamilton won the sprint race on Saturday but he and team-mate Charles Leclerc were both disqualified from the main grand prix.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions after the race in Shanghai.\nHow long do you think Red Bull will give Liam Lawson to get up to speed before contemplating a switch? - Jon\nIt rather looks as if their patience has already run out. Red Bull are to discuss Lawson's future this week, and there is a strong possibility he will be dropped for the next race in Japan.\nIf they go through with it, it will be regarded as a quite remarkable decision, which raises serious questions about the management at Red Bull Racing.\nTo understand why, let's rewind.\nIn May last year, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a two-year contract taking him to the end of 2026.\nThis was despite the fact that the Mexican was struggling as Max Verstappen's team-mate, and that the 2024 season looked to be going the same way as the year before - a bright start from Perez, and then an alarming slump in form.\nHorner could have brought in Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. But he remembered the tension between the Sainz and Verstappen camps when they were team-mates at Toro Rosso in 2015 and decided he did not want go there again.\nRe-signing Perez, Horner's theory went, would give him the confidence to recover his form.\nThe strategy failed spectacularly. Perez's performances fell off a cliff, and the team slumped to third in the constructors' championship despite Verstappen winning a fourth world title by 63 points.\nVerstappen only won twice in the final 14 races of the year because the car lost competitiveness and became difficult to drive. Hence Perez's struggles.\nBut Horner and Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko decided that Perez had had his day and they needed to make a change.\nThey paid him off - to the tune of many millions of dollars - and signed Lawson.\nThey picked the New Zealander over his much more experienced team-mate at the junior Racing Bulls team, Yuki Tsunoda, because they believed he had a mental toughness the Japanese lacked.\nLawson has had a dire start to the season. He qualified 18th at the season-opener in Melbourne, where he crashed out of the race, and last in both the sprint and grand prix in China, failing to make much progress in either event.\nBut Verstappen is also struggling - at least relatively. He is not hiding his belief that the car is the slowest of the top four teams - indeed he implied pretty strongly in China that he believed it may not be as fast as the Racing Bull.\nThe Red Bull is nervous on corner entry, has mid-corner understeer and is snappy on exits. And the team don't seem to know how to fix it.\nVerstappen likes a sharp front end, but he doesn't want the car to behave like this. But he can cope, and get a lap time out of it. Lawson cannot, at least not yet.\nLawson was talking in China as if he already knew the writing was on the wall.\n\"It's just (got) a very small window,\" he said. \"It's hard, you know \u2013 it's hard to drive, to get it in that window. I'd like to say that with time that'll come \u2013 I just don't have time to do that. It's something I need to get on top of.\"\nIf Red Bull drop him after two races, the management will have some serious explaining to do.\nIf signing him was the right decision in December, why is it the wrong decision now, they will be asked. If Tsunoda is the driver replacing him, the question becomes even starker.\nAnd if instead they choose Frenchman Isack Hadjar, who has impressed as Tsunoda's rookie team-mate in the first two grands prix, well, that's surely too early.\nEqually, if the first-order problem is the car - as it seems to be - why blame the driver?\nFor many in F1 there is an aphorism that sums up Red Bull's approach to their second seat: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\nLiam Lawson finished 12th in the Chinese Grand Prix, eight positions and nearly 55 seconds behind Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen\nAre Ferrari at fault for the double disqualification, or was it just unlucky and out of their control? \u2013 Ozan\nFormula 1 lives on the edge. To win, teams have to push their cars as close to the limit of the technical regulations as possible - because that is what everyone is doing.\nThe line between success and failure is so fine. And weight and ride height are two of the key performance differentiators.\nOne kilogram of extra weight in F1 costs approximately 0.035secs a lap. Multiply that by the 56 laps of the Chinese Grand Prix, for example, and it's two seconds of race time. Not a lot, but it could be the difference between winning and not, or one place higher or lower.\nThat's just to explain why cars are run to the edge. And when you run to the edge, mistakes can happen.\nIn the case of Ferrari on Sunday, Charles Leclerc's car was found to be 1kg underweight.\nFerrari ascribed this to the fact that they had switched to a one-stop strategy, so the car finished the race with less rubber on the tyres than had they run the expected two-stop, and that was the difference between being over the minimum weight limit and under.\nOf course, other teams also switched to a one-stop, without ending up underweight. But exactly the same thing happened to Mercedes with George Russell in Belgium last year when he was disqualified from victory.\nAs for Lewis Hamilton, his skid blocks had worn too much. Again, it's the sort of thing that can happen - indeed, it happened to Hamilton when he was at Mercedes in the 2023 US Grand Prix, and Leclerc in the same race.\nAgain, it's about pushing the margins. Generally with these current cars, the lower they can be run, the more downforce they can create, as long as teams can keep the aerodynamics stable.\nBut run them too low, and they risk wearing the floor excessively - and that's what happened.\nThese things are generally not deliberate. They are just what can happen when pushing performance to the edge.\nAside from the McLaren, who has impressed you the most at this very early stage? \u2013 SJM\nRacing Bulls have had a very strong start to the season. Tsunoda qualified fifth in Australia, and his team-mate Hadjar was seventh on the grid and Tsunoda ninth in China.\nThe races have gone a bit wrong so far, but the car looks strong - in China, Verstappen was even implying it was better than the Red Bull.\nRacing Bulls use a fair few Red Bull parts but since Red Bull have started struggling that is not necessarily the boost it was in theory a year or two ago, when the close relationship between the two teams was causing concern among rivals.\nIn the cockpit, Hadjar, notwithstanding his crash on the formation lap in Australia, has made a strong first impression.\nOverall, a very positive start to the year by the second Red Bull team.\nRacing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda both finished the Chinese Grand Prix but outside of the points\nHow was there such a big gap between Lewis Hamilton's sprint pace and qualifying pace? Or how did the other drivers close the gap in such a short space of time? \u2013 Ash\nThere is a combination of reasons. Ferrari hit the ground running in China and landed on a decent set-up for sprint qualifying in the single practice session before it.\nOn top of that, Hamilton put in a brilliant performance on a track where he has always excelled to take pole.\nBut there was an element of underachievement from other teams involved.\nThe McLaren was the fastest car in China and Oscar Piastri was more comfortable in it than Lando Norris. Both made mistakes in sprint qualifying - so they ended up third and sixth on the grid.\nHamilton converted pole into a lead at the first corner and then used the benefit of free air to maximise his opportunity.\nHe drove superbly, but he was protected from Piastri for much of the race by Verstappen, who the Australian did not pass until four laps from the end, by which time Hamilton had built a lead too big to overhaul.\nThe teams can change their set-ups after the sprint and it looks as if, by the time of grand prix qualifying, a more natural order emerged.\nAs Hamilton put it: \"We had a pretty decent car in the sprint, and then we made some changes to try and move forward and improve the car, but it made it quite a bit worse, basically, going into qualifying - and then it was even worse in the race.\"\nAmong those changes seems to have been lifting the car slightly, which Hamilton more or less confirmed after the race: \"I don't know who said we lifted the car, but we made some other changes, mostly, as well as that, but not massively, just small amounts.\"\nThey did not work - team-mate Leclerc was faster than Hamilton in the grand prix even though he had a damaged front wing. And the changes were not enough to stop Hamilton's car wearing the skid blocks too much. Hence his disqualification.\nThrow in Leclerc's disqualification for his car being underweight and it was a bad day at the office for Ferrari.\nWhy do teams put a board out from the pit wall as the drivers go through; surely all information is passed by the radio or telemetry? \u2013 Phil\nPit boards are there to give non-essential information relating to the drivers - primarily laps remaining. The gap to the drivers in front and behind are often also included.\nThey're also there as a back-up in case the radio fails.\nIt is, to a degree, a hangover from the past. But it's also simple and effective and there is no reason to stop doing it and plenty of reasons to continue.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\n'McLaren the class of the field but have hard tightrope to walk'\nObituary: Eddie Jordan, the flamboyant deal-maker of Formula 1\nChinese Grand Prix Review\nEddie Jordan Tribute",

A beloved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather.\n\"An enormous thank you to everyone that has been caring and considerate in supporting Peter through these difficult recent times.\"\nBBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew\n\nWhen I was aged 11, my dad took me to a Gillette Cup final at Lord's between Lancashire and Kent, and I saw a fast bowler running in from the Nursery End. I'd never seen anything like it. I turned to my dad and said: \"That's who I want to be.\" It was Peter Lever.\nThere was something about the way he bowled. The energy, the run-up. It lit a spark under me and, from that moment on, I was Peter Lever. My dad wanted me to be an off-spinner, like him, but there was no chance after I'd seen Peter bowl. I copied his action and he was everywhere in my life as I grew up.\nWhen I was about 15 I went to stay with my grandmother in Cheshire and paid to have some coaching in the Lancashire nets at Old Trafford. Because I was reasonably quick, I got promoted to bowl to the first team. I was so nervous. Peter was in the net next door. It was like a dream come true.\nI followed him religiously. For a fast bowler, he was an incredibly gentle character.\nIn 1965, when South Africa visited England and played against Lancashire in a tour match, Peter refused to play against them because of apartheid.\nThen, in the first Test against New Zealand in Auckland in 1975, he had the horrendous experience of hitting the home number 11 Ewen Chatfield with a bouncer. Chatfield almost died. It nearly destroyed Peter.\nA few years later, in a famous game between Derbyshire and Lancashire at Buxton, it snowed and left the pitch as something of a lottery. Peter refused to bowl because he thought it was too dangerous.\nThe bond forged between his former England captain Raymond Illingworth and Peter continued after their playing days. When Raymond was in charge of the England team as the supremo head coach and selector, he made Peter the bowling coach.\nPeter moved with his wife Ros to Devon, immersing himself in the local community. He coached at Lewdown Cricket Club and planted wild flowers around the village.\nIn 2017, Andrew Strauss arranged a 'Club England' dinner at Lord's for everyone, men and women, who had ever played for England. I was asked to host the evening and accepted only on the condition I could sit next to Peter. We were all given special caps to recognise our time playing for England. I presented Peter's to him and he presented mine to me. It was a lovely moment.\nHe had a massive influence on my cricketing life. They say you should never meet your heroes. I'm so lucky that I got to know mine.\nJonathan Agnew and Peter Lever in 2016\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Hovland's victory was his seventh on the PGA Tour\nFamed sport psychologist Bob Rotella constantly reminds his clients that golf is not a pursuit anyone can perfect.\nBut it is a game that still attracts more than its share of perfectionists. Characters such as Viktor Hovland, who dragged himself from apparent golfing oblivion to become the latest winner on the PGA Tour.\nThis out of the blue success was an astonishing turnaround of form and fortune.\n\"It's like you keep drowning and you're running out of air,\" the 27-year-old Norwegian said of his recent travails after beating Justin Thomas in the Valspar Championship last Sunday to land yet another European victory on American soil this year.\nHovland's late surge secures Valspar Championship victory\nEngland's Mansell wins maiden DP Tour title\nEngland's Rhodes holds nerve to claim maiden LET victory\nIt is fair to say Hovland's success was among the least expected in a series of 2025 wins that will surely cheer European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald. This was the Oslo born star's first win since the 2023 Tour Championship.\nThen he was ranked the fourth best player on the world, someone who possessed an unorthodox but highly effective swing and who had solved his problems around the green, seemingly the only aspect holding him back.\nIn short, he looked a complete player, one ready to start winning majors and capable of becoming a dominant figure. The finished article.\nYet, there is no such thing in this game. The pursuit for better never ends and capriciously it brings no guarantees of improvement.\nThere are those who say \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".  Rory McIlroy used that very phrase talking about aspects of his own game in the wake of his recent play-off win at the Players Championship.\nBut Hovland most certainly does not fall into that category.\n\"I find it kind of weird that we're professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, 'oh he's a perfectionist, he's out on the perimeter searching too much',\" he commented.\n\"That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments. So if you're not going to try to get better, what are you doing?\"\nThis from a player who had the world at his feet, only to then make a string of swing changes while emulating the Watford FC approach to hiring and firing coaches.\nIn the 574 days that followed his Tour Championship victory, Hovland slumped from first to 137th on the tour's FedEx Cup standings. He had missed the cut in his previous three outings, including starting the Players with a ruinous 80.\nBut the golfer believed the constant tinkering, the pursuit of perfection, to be entirely justified. \"It's not like I'm inventing stuff,\" he said.\nBut what he did realise was that he needed to go back to feels and methods that had previously worked. \"I have data that can show that what I used to do was objectively better than what I'm doing now.\n\"So why shouldn't I try to go back to what I used to do?\"\nHe reconnected with former coach Grant Waite while still pondering whether it was worth heading to Tampa for the tournament he ultimately won. \"I was not very hopeful with my game leading into this week,\" Hovland admitted.\nBetween them they found an old feel on the range last Tuesday. It had been lost in pursuit for more speed and its rediscovery was a vital building block.\n\"He's really hard on himself,\" Hovland's caddie Shay Knight told PGATour.com. \"But as soon as he finds some little swing cue or thought, he tends to take it on board, and it happens really fast.\n\"And it just seemed to click; I knew something special was going to happen this week with the swing thought.\"\nHovland was far from perfect and still fearful of losing long shots high and right, but he had a foundation to make him competitive. \"Incredibly, I did make it work and was able to win and I think that is something that I'm extremely proud of,\" he smiled.\nThe game remains \"more stressful than it should be\" but he feels reuniting with Waite, a former tour player, will lead to more success.\n\"He's definitely put his heart and soul into looking at all the different golf swings that I've sent him,\" Hovland said.\n\"It's challenging because I have a very unique pattern and it's unconventional and I would say most coaches probably would like to make my swing more conventional and hopefully try to fix the problem.\n\"But that's not really how my golf swing works. And I really trust Grant, because he he sees it and knows what kind of matchups need to be there for it to work.\"\nHovland's win follows two PGA Tour victories for Northern Ireland's McIlroy already this year as well as big wins for Swede Ludvig Aberg, Austria's Sepp Straka and Belgium's Thomas Detry.\nThese results fuel optimism for a successful Ryder Cup defence for Europe at Bethpage in September. But do not get carried away.\nBack in 2023 Americans Scottie Scheffler, Max Homa and Sam Burns were posting victories at this time of year, while Brooks Koepka, Wyndham Clark and Brian Harman landed majors. But the US team were soundly beaten in Rome.\nThere are no guarantees in the sport that Rotella, who has advised a string of major winners, insists is not \"a game of perfect\".  So it should not be a surprise that even Hovland's short-term hopes for next month's Masters are tempered.\n\"Some of the shots that I'm hitting, it's going to make it really difficult for me to be in contention at Augusta,\" he admitted.\n\"You're going to hit so many long irons into par-four holes and you've got to drive it pretty far because the fairways are pretty wide.\n\"It's more of a bomber's paradise versus this place (Copperhead in Tampa) where it's more just about being precise off the tee.\n\"So there's still some things that I need to improve, but luckily we've got two weeks and this is certainly nice to have in the back of my mind leading up to Augusta.\"",

Her strength and conditioning coach Yutaka Nakamura has barely left her side since starting in early December.\nRoman Kelecic, a coach from her teenage days, helped out in Abu Dhabi. Jane O'Donoghue, a friend and former LTA coach, was in Doha and Dubai. Tom Welsh was drafted in from the Loughborough Academy as a short-term hire for Indian Wells, only for Vladimir Platenik to usurp him by arriving in California for a hastily arranged trial.\nAfter only two weeks that trial was ended by Raducanu on the eve of her first-round victory in Miami - and a seat offered once again to O\u2019Donoghue and the broadcaster and coach Mark Petchey.\nHow 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coach\nSecond Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefing\nPetchey coached an 18-year-old Andy Murray for 10 months - during which he won his first ATP title - and trained with Raducanu during the pandemic summer of 2020.\nThose weeks at the National Tennis Centre in London appear to have left quite an impression on Raducanu. There is a mutual respect and rapport between the two.\nO'Donoghue has been a regular confidante for Raducanu, and was the LTA\u2019s national women\u2019s coach until 2019, when she left the sport for pastures new.\nRaducanu trusts them and is able to relax in their company, but they both have day jobs.\nPetchey is in broadcasting - most notably with the Tennis Channel - and O\u2019Donoghue in finance. She is currently on a sabbatical, but there is no suggestion she wants to return to the far less secure world of tennis coaching on a permanent basis.\nBoth could offer input but, as things stand, not the type of support Raducanu said she was seeking when speaking to the BBC at Indian Wells.\n\"Once I have a structure in place and I can fall back on the process again I will feel very set,\" she said this month.\n\"In the Middle East it was very difficult for me because I didn't really have any direction or structure or which tournaments to play and it was very difficult doing it all on my own.\n\"I'm that kind of person who needs a plan and needs preparation. That's what I'm building and that's making me feel more comfortable.\"\nJane O'Donoghue (left) was with Emma Raducanu in Miami\nRaducanu is part of the Great Britain team which will compete in the Billie Jean King Cup qualifying round in early April, and will be able to spend the next two weeks working with the LTA coaching team.\nBut she will need a more lasting plan swiftly.\nHer clay-court season could take in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome before thre French Open, and there will be very little respite in the schedule before the end of October.\nThat plan does not need to revolve around one person.\nMany top players employ more than one coach, usually because it is very hard for any one individual to commit to more than 30 weeks on the road each year.\nJack Draper ended last summer\u2019s partnership with Wayne Ferreira as he preferred the \"one voice\" of James Trotman, but now travels to some events with Alex Ward.\nPerhaps things could have worked out differently with Cavaday if an additional coach had been brought into the team when his health problems first arose in the spring of 2024.\nExposure to different personalities and ways of thinking has always been appealing to Raducanu, but the period with Cavaday offered her stability and calmness.\nThey liked each other, having first established a coaching partnership when Raducanu was a girl. Cavaday was a good sounding board, and there was evidence from her play last spring and summer that the two could flourish in future.\nOther partnerships fizzled out much more quickly.\nPlatenik lasted only two weeks. His coaching acumen is widely admired, but his personality did not seem a good match for Raducanu.\nOne former player compared him to a \"freight train\", saying he was intense and opinionated. Platenik says Raducanu told him she was feeling \u201cstressed\u201d when ending the brief collaboration.\nTorben Beltz looked an excellent choice, given his Grand Slam success with Angelique Kerber, but Raducanu did not feel he had enough to offer.\nDmitry Tursunov ended their partnership because he thought Raducanu needed to listen to just \"one voice\". He referred to \"red flags\" and a feeling there may be further problems down the line.\nHer spell with Sebastian Sachs concluded after operations on both hands and left ankle, which kept her on the sidelines for the second half of 2023.\nThere did not seem much logic in dispensing of the services of Nigel Sears after Wimbledon 2021, but it is hard to argue with the choice of Andrew Richardson, who then steered her to that historic triumph at the US Open.\nHowever, that partnership ended there.\nWould Raducanu go back to a coach she has previously let go? Sears still looks a good bet and has a proven track record of success with Daniela Hantuchova, Ana Ivanovic and Anett Kontaveit.\nHe is no longer working with the Australian Olivia Gadecki, and is a regular at the National Tennis Centre in London, where he works with the LTA's women's team.\nFor all her progress in Miami, Raducanu may have a difficult spring and summer without the right personnel around her.\nDoes she ever throws a covetous glance at Draper's set-up?\nHis team looks a thoroughly professional outfit, and some hard decisions have recently been made.\nPhysio Will Herbert and strength and conditioning coach Steve Kotze are no longer involved. They have been replaced by Shane Annun and Matt Little, who were so integral to Andy Murray's team.\nAnd Trotman remains as head coach. He has been working full-time with the new Indian Wells champion since the end of 2021, in which time Draper has risen from outside the top 250 and into the world's top 10.",

        "article_text": "The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.\nBut there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.\n\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Phillip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.\nIn exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.\nWe're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.\nWater and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.\nPhillip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.\nMore importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.\nSo cheap it made business sense for Phillip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.\nEach machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.\nOccasionally Phillip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.\nAt the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Phillip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.\n\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.\nZengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.\nIt was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.\nBritish-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.\nNow it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.\nAllowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.\n\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.\nThe bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.\nBitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.\nThe town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.\nOnly one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.\nAlthough the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses. \nSo, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.\n\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"\nHe's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.\n\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"\nEmbracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.\nElsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.\nLike many young people, they're glued to their phones.\n\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.\nThe little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.\n\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.\n\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.\n\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"\nNot many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.\nBut soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.\nZengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.\nSoon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.\nPhillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news.

We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.Most of the money needed to build Zengamina Hydro was donated by UK churchesAlthough the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.Gridless' bitcoin mines use excess electricity from renewable energy plantsIt was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.Set ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.But they are also a rare example of a controversial industry creating much more than just digital coins.More Technology of BusinessThe slow but steady advance of driverless vehiclesSubsea fibre cables can 'listen out' for sabotageWhy people are cutting back their online profileBitcoinZambiaAfricaRenewable energyCryptocurrency",

        "article_text": "Ever found yourself speechless in the presence of overwhelming cuteness, like your baby nephew or the cat video you saw on Instagram? There's now a word for it: gigil. \nGigil (pronounced ghee-gill) is part of a list of \"untranslatable\" words, or those that do not have English equivalents, that have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary..\nTaken from the Philippines' Tagalog language, gigil is a \"feeling so intense that it gives us the irresistible urge to tightly clench our hands, grit our teeth, and pinch or squeeze whomever or whatever it is\u202fwe find so adorable\".\nAlamak, a colloquial exclamation used to convey surprise or outrage in Singapore and Malaysia, also made the list.\n\"Wouldn't it be useful for English speakers to have a specific word for sunlight dappling through leaves...

        "article_text": "Most modern structures are built to last 50 years or so, but ingenious ancient engineering has kept this watery city afloat for more than 1,600 years \u2013 using only wood.\nAs any local knows, Venice is an upside-down forest. The city, which turned 1604 years old on March 25, is built on the foundations of millions of short wooden piles, pounded in the ground with their tip facing downwards. These trees \u2013 larch, oak, alder, pine, spruce and elm of a length ranging between 3.5m (11.5ft) to less than 1m (3ft) \u00a0\u2013 have been holding up stone palazzos and tall belltowers for centuries, in a true marvel of engineering leveraging the forces of physics and nature.\nIn most modern structures, reinforced concrete and steel do the work that this inverted forest has been doing for centuries. But despite their strength, few foundations today could last as long as Venice's. \"Concrete or steel piles are designed [with a guarantee to last] 50 years today,\" says Alexander\u00a0Puzrin, professor of geomechanics and geosystems engineering at the ETH university in Zurich, Switzerland. \"Of course, they might last longer, but when we build houses and industrial structures, the standard is 50 years of life.\"\nBuilding to last\nOnly once, early on in his career, Puzrin has been asked to provide a guarantee of 500 years for a construction a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed temple in Israel.\n\"I was kind of shocked because this was unusual,\" he recalls. \"I was really scared, and they wanted me to sign. I called my boss in Tel Aviv, a very experienced, old engineer and I said, 'What are we going to do? They want 500 years.' He answered, '500 years? [pause]. Sign.' None of us is going to be there.\"\nThe Venetian piles technique is fascinating for its geometry, its centuries-old resilience, and for its sheer scale. No-one is exactly sure how many millions of piles there are under the city, but there are 14,000 tightly packed wooden poles in the foundations of the Rialto bridge\u00a0alone, and 10,000 oak trees under the San Marco Basilica, which was built in 832AD.\n\"I was born and raised in Venice,\" says Caterina Francesca Izzo, environmental chemistry and cultural heritage professor at the University of Venice. \"Growing up, like everyone else, I knew that underneath the Venetian buildings, there are the trees of Cadore [the mountain region next to Venice]. But I didn't know how these piles were placed, how they were counted and knocked down, nor the fact that the battipali\u00a0(literally the 'pile hitters') had a very important profession. They even had their own songs. It is fascinating from a technical and technological point of view.\"\u00a0\nThe battipali would hammer down the piles by hand, and they would sing an ancient\u00a0song\u00a0to keep the rhythm \u2013 a haunting and repetitive melody with lyrics that praise Venice, its republican glory, its Catholic faith, and declare death to the enemy of the time, the Turks. On a more lighthearted note, a Venetian expression still in use today, na testa da bater pai (literally 'a head that is good to pound down the piles') is a colourful way of saying that someone is dull or slow-witted.\nThe piles were stuck as deep as possible, until they couldn't be pounded down any further, starting at the outer edge of the structure and moving towards the centre of the foundations, usually driving nine piles per square metre in a spiral shape. The heads were then sawn to obtain a regular surface, which would lay below sea-level.\nTransverse wooden structures \u2013 either zatteroni (boards) or madieri (beams) \u2013 were placed on top. In the case of the bell towers, these beams or boards were up to 50cm (20in) thick. For other buildings, the dimensions were 20cm (8in) or even less. Oak provided the most resilient wood, but it was also the most precious. (Later on, oak would only be used to build ships \u2013 it was too valuable to stick in the mud.) On top of this wooden foundation, workers would place the stone of the building.\nThe Republic of Venice soon began protecting its forests to provide sufficient wood for construction, as well as for ships. \"Venice invented sylviculture,\" explains Nicola Macchioni, research director at the institute for bioeconomy at Italy's National Council for Research, referring to the practice of cultivating trees. \"The first official sylviculture document in Italy is indeed from the Magnificent Community of the Fiemme Valley [to the north-west of Venice], dating from 1111AD. It details rules to exploit the woods without depleting them.\"\nAccording to Macchioni, these conservation practices must have been in use years before they were written down. \"That explains why the Fiemme Valley is still covered by a lush fir forest today.\" Countries such as England, however, were facing wood shortages by the middle of the 16th Century already, he adds.\nVenice is not the only city relying on wooden piles for foundations \u2013 but there are key differences that make it unique. Amsterdam is another city partially built on wooden piles \u2013 here and in many other northern European cities, they go all the way down until they reach the bedrock, and they work like long columns, or like the legs of a table.\n\"Which is fine if the rock is close to the surface,\" says Thomas Leslie, professor of architecture at the University of Illinois. But in many regions, the bedrock is well beyond the reach of a pile. On the shore of Lake Michigan in the US, where Leslie is based, the bedrock could be 100ft (30m) below the surface. \"Finding trees that big is difficult, right? There were stories of Chicago in the 1880s where they tried to drive one tree trunk on top of another, which, as you can imagine ended up not working. Finally, they realised that you could rely on the friction of the soil.\"\nThe principle is based on the idea of reinforcing the soil, by sticking in as many piles as possible, raising substantial friction between piles and soil. \"What's clever about that,\" says Leslie, \"is that you're sort of using the physics\u2026 The beauty of it is that you're using the fluid nature of the soil to provide resistance to hold the buildings up.\" The technical term for this is hydrostatic pressure, which essentially means that the soil \"grips\" the piles if many are inserted densely in one spot, Leslie says.\nIndeed, the Venetian piles work this way \u2013 they are too short to reach bedrock, and instead keep the buildings up thanks to friction. But the history of this way of building goes back further still.\nThe technique was mentioned by 1st-Century Roman engineer and architect Vitruvius; Romans would use submerged piles to build bridges, which again are close to water. Water gates in China were built with friction piles too. The Aztecs used them in Mexico City, until the Spanish came, tore down the ancient city and built their Catholic cathedral on top, Puzrin notes. \"The Aztecs knew how to build in their environment much better than the Spanish later, who have now huge problems with this metropolitan cathedral [where the floor is sinking unevenly].\"\nPuzrin holds a graduate class at ETH that investigates famous geotechnical failures. \"And this is one of these failures. This Mexico City cathedral, and Mexico City in general, is an open-air museum of everything that can go wrong with your foundations.\"\nAfter more than a millennium and a half in the water, Venice's foundations have proved remarkably resilient. They are not, however, immune to damage.\u00a0\nTen years ago, a team from the universities of Padova and Venice (departments ranging from forestry to engineering and cultural heritage) investigated the condition of the city's foundations, starting from the belltower of the Frari Church, built in 1440 on alder piles.\nThe Frari belltower has been sinking 1mm (0.04in) a year since its construction, for a total of 60cm (about 24in). Compared with churches and buildings, belltowers have more weight distributed on a smaller surface and therefore sink deeper and faster, \"like a stiletto heel\", says Macchioni, who was part of the team investigating the city\u2019s foundations.\nCaterina Francesca Izzo was working on the field, core drilling, collecting and analyzing wood samples from underneath churches, belltowers and from the side of the canals, which were being emptied out and cleaned up at the time. She said that they had to be careful while they were working on the bottom of the dry canal, to avoid the wastewater sporadically gushing from the side pipes.\nThe team found that throughout the structures they investigated, the wood was damaged (bad news), but the system of water, mud and wood was keeping it all together (good news).\nThey debunked the common belief that the wood underneath the city doesn't rot because it's in an oxygen-free, or anaerobic, condition \u2013 bacteria do attack wood, even in absence of oxygen. But bacteria action is much slower than the action of fungi and insects, which operate in the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, water fills up the cells that are emptied out by bacteria, allowing wooden piles to maintain their shape. So even if the wooden piles are damaged, the whole system of wood, water and mud is held together under intense pressure, and is kept resilient for centuries.\n\"Is there anything to worry about? Yes and no, but we should still consider continuing this type of research,\" says Izzo. Since the sampling 10 years ago, they hadn't collected new ones, mainly because of the logistics involved.\nIt's not known for how many more hundreds of years the foundations will last, says Macchioni. \"However, [it will last] as long as the environment remains the same. The foundation system works because it is made of wood, soil and water.\" The soil creates an oxygen-free environment, the water both contributes to that and maintains the shape of the cells, and the wood provides friction. Without one of these three elements, the system collapses.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, wood was completely replaced by cement in foundation construction. In recent years, though, a new trend of building with wood has gained increased interest, including the rise of wooden skyscrapers. \"It's kind of the cool material right now, and for really good reasons,\" comments Leslie. Wood is a carbon sink, it's biodegradable and thanks to its ductility, it's considered among the most earthquake-resistant materials.\n\"We can't of course build entire cities on wood nowadays because we are too many on the planet,\" adds Macchioni, but it's undeniable that without artificial materials and without motors, ancient builders just had to be more ingenious. Venice is not the only city with wooden foundations, but it is \"the only one [where the friction technique was used] en masse that is still surviving today and is so insanely beautiful\", adds Puzrin. \"There were people out there who didn't study soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, and yet they produced something we can only dream about producing, which lasted so long. They were amazing, intuitive engineers who did exactly the right thing, taking advantage of all these special conditions.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Callum Hudson-Odoi made the last of his three England appearances in 2019 but is returning to the form that could see him win more\nCallum Hudson-Odoi feels he is almost back at the beginning of his career.\nThe winger's mindset now, as then, is going into every game feeling he can score or assist, being part of the conversation around the England senior team, and once again trying to impress Thomas Tuchel.\nNow 24, the three-cap England international has been a key part of a Nottingham Forest side that has maintained their Premier League form to close in on Champions League qualification. Forest also face a trip to Brighton in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on Saturday.\nSix years ago, Hudson-Odoi was one of the most exciting prospects in English football. He had been the Chelsea academy golden boy, with the club knocking back bids to sign him in the January 2019 transfer window from Bayern Munich. \nHe made his England debut under Gareth Southgate in March, coming on as a substitute in a 5-0 win over the Czech Republic in a Euro 2020 qualifier. He was 18 and became the youngest to play for England in a competitive international match, breaking Duncan Edwards' 64-year-old record. \nBut in April 2019, he ruptured his Achilles tendon in a match against Burnley. The tendon completely detached from the bone and his seven months out of the game was followed by further setbacks.\n\"I had been playing games week in, week out, got my first call up for England and I step off and boom, everything collapses,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It was tough, it was very tough.\n\"At the time, I was just thinking am I going to be the same player I was? Will I be able to sprint or kick a ball again?\"\nMaurizio Sarri was Chelsea's manager at the time of the injury, followed by Frank Lampard. But it was Tuchel who gave Hudson-Odoi his most minutes on the pitch while at Stamford Bridge. \nHowever, it was not all straightforward. Tuchel, now the England manager, gave him a dose of \"tough love\".\nIn a 1-1 draw with Southampton in February 2021, Hudson-Odoi came on at half-time but was then substituted off 31 minutes later, with the German coach telling journalists he was \"not happy with his attitude, energy and counter-pressing\".\n\"Maybe it is even unfair, but it was my feeling,\" Tuchel said.\n\"I took him off. We demand 100%. I feel he is not in the right shape to help us.\n\"He knows what I demand from him and when he doesn't reach this level, it's a hard decision.\"\nFast forward to this season and Hudson-Odoi's form for Forest - he has five goals and two assists - led to speculation about him making Tuchel's first England squad and a return to the national set-up after making his third and, so far, last appearance in November 2019 in a 4-0 win over Kosovo.\nHe missed out on the 26-man squad but speaking before the international break about playing under Tuchel, he said: \"We had our differences at times and that is normal. Every player and coach has their differences.\n\"Like [when Tuchel had me] playing wing-back and I am like why am I here? \n\"But it was to benefit the team and it benefits myself, helping me work on my defensive game. \n\"It's good that we had that moment and we have talked about it. He is an amazing manager and he knows how to get the best out of players. \n\"If the possibility and chance [for England] comes \u2013 I will have to go there and prove myself all over again.\n\"I just control what I can control. It's about enjoying my football once again, smiling and being positive.\"\nHudson-Odoi says he is \"more mature\" having lived through so much since making his professional debut at the age of 17.\nHe insists, though, his motivation about returning to the level which made him the most coveted youngster in the country, comes from within.\n\"I don't want to prove anything to anybody,\" he said. \"It is about proving to myself that I can still be that player I was \u2013 to go back to a level where I knew I was going to score or assist \u2013 and be that confident where I know I am going to impact in every game.\"\nHudson-Odoi is also dreaming of success under Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo. \n\"This season everything has just changed \u2013 from mentality to determination,\" he said.\n\"It's just a big drive from us and we are trying to push each other every day. We know we have the ability to do this.\n\"We know where we are but we have to keep dreaming and believing that as a team.\"\nLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan views\nGet Nottingham Forest news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Back pain is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, but an AI-powered app is being used to help patients in the UK to manage their symptoms. But how does it measure up?\nWhen I hurt my back in October 2024, the cause wasn't immediately clear. Perhaps, something went awry while hoisting one of my young nephews in the air. Or, more likely, I messed my back up while lifting a bed so my wife could slide a rug underneath.\nWhatever the trigger, my overconfidence in my own strength left me with a lower back injury. Days later, the pain began radiating down the sciatic nerve in my left leg. Standing was fine, sitting was torture. In order to sleep, I had to slide a pillow underneath my legs to keep the downward-pulsing shockwaves at bay.\nBy mid-December, I saw a pain medicine specialist in the area of Washington, DC where I live. He ran some movement tests, sent me for X-rays, and wrote me a referral for physical therapy with a diagnosis of \"lumbar radiculopathy\". In the United States, this is a relatively quick process \u2013 I went from pain to starting treatment in about three months. But that's still a very long time for something so common \u2013 and debilitating \u2013 as lower back pain.\nSince early January, I have seen human physical therapists who work wonders. Once a week, I go in, discuss my pain, get a soft-tissue massage, and do well-supervised exercises and stretches. My pain isn't gone, but it's finally under control.\nI specified that these physical therapists are human because, well, I've also been seeing a new physio in the UK. But my new British physio is only partly human. Rather, she's a series of pre-recorded videos made by a real physiotherapist, powered by artificial intelligence that I can access via an app on my phone.\nThe service, provided by a company called Flok Health, is the first artificial intelligence clinic \u2013 of any kind \u2013 to be trialled by the UK's National Health Service (NHS). It's been approved for use by the country\u2019s Care Quality Commission as a registered healthcare provider, and began seeing patients \u2013 just like me \u2013 at the end of 2024.\nThe reason: a lot of people suffer from lower back pain and struggle to get access to the care they need. As of September 2024, nearly 350,000 people in England alone were on waiting lists for treatment for musculoskeletal problems \u2013 the longest of all waitlists for any set of conditions. The UK government reported that 23.4 million work days were lost in 2022 alone due to these untreated problems, implying an enormous economic as well as human cost. Globally, lower back pain is a leading cause of disability and affects an estimated 223 million people worldwide.\u00a0\nFlok's promise is to start seeing patients immediately, relieve the burden on the NHS, and head off patients' back pain before they go untreated and deteriorate. It's a noble mission, but I had one question: Was AI really the answer?\nIn addition to being a trained doctor, Finn Stevenson spent time as a professional rower in Great Britain's Olympic development programme. Anyone who has rowed before \u2013 or even spent time on a rowing machine at a gym \u2013 knows that the sport can be an incredible workout but also brutal on the back if your form isn't perfect. While a professional athlete, Stevenson had access to top doctors and physiotherapists who could treat his ailments immediately. But when he left rowing and his back pain flared up, he realised what it's like for everyone else trying to receive care.\n\"It was quite a big shock in terms of what access to care looked like for 99.5% of people,\" says Stevenson, now Flok's chief executive. \"In theory, I should be pretty well placed to manage this. I had an academic background, I'd had three years of professional physio. If I was struggling, other people probably were too.\"\nStevenson and Ric da Silva, now his co-founder and Flok's chief technology officer, met when they were early employees at a company called CMR Surgical, a British startup where the pair worked on building robotics for soft-tissue surgery.\u00a0\nBut with Flok, they are aiming to provide treatment to people who don't need surgery. They are looking to help people with the easiest and most manageable cases.\u00a0\n\"There are quite a few conditions where that's true, where you don't need a scan, you don't need hands-on manipulation, you don't need medication,\" says da Silva. \"What you need is 10 minutes of stretches a few times a week, and that will solve the problem.\"\nThe idea is that this should then free up clinicians to focus on the patients with more complex problems who really need their help.\nWhen I first open Flok, I'm greeted by Kirsty, my physiotherapist. She appears in a minimalist setting with all of the accoutrements befitting a yoga instructor: black workout outfit, bamboo-coloured exercise mat, contemporary office chair, and a Monstera plant. She asks me questions about myself and my pain, and I respond by clicking multiple-choice options. Each response triggers a follow-up question or instruction as the underlying AI adapts to my answers.\nBut rather than being a live video call, this interaction is a series of pre-recorded video that are stitched together by AI based on my answers.\u00a0\nWhile the artificial intelligence boom of the past few years has been spurred by advances in generative AI from large language models, Flok has a different use for AI. \"We essentially developed a domain specific language for describing clinical reasoning,\" says Stevenson. Because it's not a ChatGPT-like chatbot predicting the next word in a sequence, there isn't a risk of the so-called hallucination problem in AI where an algorithm makes things up \u2013 a major concern about AI in the medical field.\nInstead, this AI is more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where there are more than one billion \"intervention combinations\", says Stevenson. The power of AI makes it possible to deliver this in a seamless way.\nIt's a \"perfect software problem\", says Stevenson. \"Software is an extremely good delivery model if you know what you're trying to deliver, and if you just need to do that in a more scalable way.\"\nFlok is currently expanding its operations. Its service launched first in Scotland at the end of last year and has recently signed contracts to add locations in England, though Stevenson isn't yet able to reveal where. In the next 12 months, Stevenson said he hopes to cover at least half of the UK. And they're also expanding what pain areas they're treating hip and knee osteoarthritis and women's pelvic health.\u00a0\nBut it is also not alone in trying to use AI to tackle musculoskeletal pain. Another AI-based app that helps patients manage pain in the lower back and neck called selfBACK has been undergoing clinical trials in the US as an add-on to more typical care services.\nNot entirely unlike Flok's approach, selfBACK works by analysing what treatments worked well for previous patients with similar conditions, then recommending personalised exercise plans. Studies have indicated that it can help to reduce pain among those who use it. But a recent trial found slow adoption rates \u2013 nearly one-third of trial participants never used the app, and another third only used it a few times. Patients and practitioners concluded that the app should be used to supplement traditional care rather than replace it. Other studies have also cautioned that self-management apps need to be provided in addition to care not as a replacement.\nEven so, research seems to suggest that mobile health apps of this nature are a potentially promising approach to helping patients manage their back pain. But there are also no shortage of questions about AI's integration into healthcare more broadly. Elizabeth A. Stuart, a professor and chair of the biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that AI healthcare tools should undergo the same rigorous evaluations as traditional medical interventions, such as regulatory approvals and peer review.\n\"In some ways, these AI tools are no different from other healthcare interventions that we want to learn about the effects of,\" says Stuart. \"We need to assess how well they work, do they work, who do they work for, just as carefully as we have done for other healthcare interventions.\"\u00a0\nStuart says that while we don't need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to AI, we do need to recognise when these systems keep evolving even after they're deployed. \"With some AI tools, they are sort of self-adapting,\" she says.\nShe contrasts AI tools with the annual flu vaccines, which undergo deliberate assessment processes each year to ensure they're targeted to the latest viral strain. But sometimes AI tools are a black box, \"changing under the hood\" in real-time and it's not always clear how, she says.\u00a0\nPranav Rajpurkar, an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School, says he sees promise in AI applications that help triage care for patients. \"What's counterintuitive is that forced collaboration between AI and clinicians often underperforms compared to a clear division of labor,\" he says. \"When doctors and AI review the same cases side-by-side, their combined accuracy is sometimes barely better than doctors alone. Clean separation of responsibilities side steps these issues.\"\nIn Flok's case, the company employs professional physios who appear in the videos that patients see, but are available to answer patient questions after their AI-enabled video sessions.\nRajpurkar predicts that eventually \"we'll move from narrow AI tools to generalist medical AI systems capable of handling multiple tasks across different domains\". It's an approach he's working on with his own company, a2z Radiology AI, which is developing AI-powered analytics for radiologists.\n\"The systems that succeed won't be those claiming to 'replace doctors', but those that thoughtfully redistribute clinical work to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and human-centered,\" says Rajpurkar.\nIn our first 20-minute session, Kirsty asks me a long list of questions about myself, about my pain, and asks me to stretch in different ways \u2013 following her careful lead on the screen \u2013 in order to decide the best course of treatment. She gives me stretches and exercises to try for the week ahead, with careful instruction not to push too hard or do anything that feels uncomfortable.\u00a0\nThis isn't the experience I have in-person with my team of human physical therapists in the US. They frequently correct my posture and tell me when I'm doing something wrong \u2013 which is often. The big difference here is that Kirsty can't see me. Her pre-recorded videos don't watch my movements and stretches. They rely on me following her instructions correctly and reporting if something is amiss. There's also an option at the end of the session to leave a voice note for a real physiotherapist who will respond to my personal needs or questions \u2013 a real voice behind the curtain.\nMy back felt better after my sessions with Flok, but the app likely isn't for me. I'm clumsy and uncoordinated and need someone watching my form at all times \u2013 if not, I'm likely to hurt myself further. That ability to watch patients and offer feedback on posture could be something AI will enable in the future \u2013 but until then, I'll be sticking with the humans.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

This time, official communication to domestic teams didn't arrive, in some cases, until 20 minutes before the squad was confirmed.\nThe reasons for such secrecy remains unclear, though the approach does lend itself to preventing news leaking before the official announcement.\nPerhaps the most significant change for the players has been Tuchel's move to naming his starting XI on a matchday.\nSouthgate usually named his team the night before a fixture - while many players knew the XI based on the shape and personnel deployed in training.\nBut, for Friday's game against Albania, the players were informed of the team during a noon meeting on the day of the match.\nFor Monday's qualifier against Latvia, sources have indicated the players didn't know the full starting XI until about 16:00 - less than four hours before the game.\nCertain clues from training have also proved red herrings.

Tuchel is determined to build on that existing camaraderie.\nIndeed, the England head coach stressed the importance of relationships in his first address to the team on Monday night.\nIn his opening speech, Tuchel reiterated they have just 24 training sessions together before USA 2026 gets under way.\nTo that end, the former Chelsea boss admitted he would not be making drastic changes to the playing style Southgate had developed.\nBased on the opening training sessions, it quickly became apparent that Tuchel would employ a four-man defence - despite conjecture the German would use a three-at-the-back system he relied on successfully at Chelsea.\nThe overriding message of Tuchel's address, though, was one of triumph and history.\n\"He said the goal was to put another star on the jersey,\" divulged Burn last week.\n\nThis video can not be played\nWhy you shouldn't want Tuchel's England peaking now\nWatch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer\nAn exciting start or lots of work needed?

A swagger. He's spent the past 10 days trying to figure out who those personalities are.\nThe media activities before Friday's win over Albania caused a stir.\nFirstly, a video clip of Reece James explaining why Tuchel was the best manager he'd worked with disappeared from ITV's social media just hours after it went live. \nIt was explained to BBC Sport that the video was removed because of embargo complications.\nThen came Tuchel's frank interview with ITV in which he said England lacked a clear identity under Southgate at Euro 2024, and that they were \"afraid\" to win the tournament.\nThe remarks were met with a mixed reaction, causing consternation among some within football amid a sense they are ill-informed and disrespectful to Southgate, particularly given England reached the final of the tournament.\nOthers have applauded Tuchel for his honesty. Similarly, the England players have been split on the merits of Tuchel's remarks.\nTime will tell whether Tuchel can fulfil his mission by lifting the World Cup in 16 months' time.\nIf he does, he will be doing it his way.",

        "article_text": "Mikaela Mayer (left) is a two-weight world champion having also held titles at super-featherweight\nWBO welterweight champion Mikaela Mayer faces Briton Sandy Ryan in a Las Vegas rematch on Saturday. \nIn her BBC Sport column, American Mayer talks about the events leading up to victory in last September's first fight in New York when Ryan was hit by a can of red paint before leaving for the venue.\nOn Friday, Ryan will address the controversy and rivalry between the pair.\nI was in my room and we were starting to walk to the elevator, waiting for the go-ahead from the team to say we could go down because we were at the same hotel as Sandy Ryan. \nSandy was out there first waiting for her car so we stood by the elevator and my nutritionist said to wait because she hasn't got in the car yet.\nMy nutritionist was looking at her phone and was like, 'oh my god, someone just threw paint on Sandy'. We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy. I have truth on my side.\nMikaela Mayer was speaking to BBC Sport's Bobbie Jackson.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty was called \"a gold digger\" and \"a murderer\". She was slut-shamed and spent 27 days in prison after a hate-filled vicious media campaign in 2020 alleged she had been involved in the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.\nNow, India's federal investigators have told a court that Rajput, a rising star in India's popular Hindi film industry, died by suicide and that neither Chakraborty nor her family had a role in his death.\nIn a statement shared with the BBC, senior lawyer Satish Maneshinde, who fought Chakraborty's case, said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had \"thoroughly investigated every aspect of the case from all angles and closed it\". \nThe findings have been presented in a special court in Mumbai, which will now decide whether to close the case or to order further investigation.\nMr Maneshinde said Chakraborty went through \"untold miseries\" and was jailed \"for no fault of hers\".\n\"The false narrative in the social media and electronic media was totally uncalled for,\" he said, calling on media bosses to \"reflect upon what they did\". \n\"Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.\"\nFeminist lawyer Payal Chawla, meanwhile, described the \"misogynistic narrative surrounding Chakraborty\" as \"deeply troubling\" and said the case \"should serve as a cautionary reminder of the perils of being judgmental\". \nChakraborty herself has offered no comment since news of CBI wanting to close the case broke at the weekend. On Monday, she was seen visiting a temple along with her brother and father - who were also named in a police complaint filed over Rajput's death. \nPerhaps the only sign that the family feel vindicated comes from her brother Showik - who spent three months in prison before being freed on bail. He shared a photo with Rhea and the caption \"Satyamev Jayate\" - Sanskrit for \"truth alone prevails\".\nRajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on 14 June 2020. Mumbai police said the 34-year-old had mental health issues, for which he was under treatment, and appeared to have taken his own life.\nChakraborty, who had been dating Rajput for a year and was living with him, had gone to live with her parents a few days before his death. \n\"Still struggling to face my emotions... an irreparable numbness in my heart\u2026 I will never come to terms with you not being here anymore,\" she later wrote on social media about her grief. \nBut within weeks, the actress found herself at the centre of a firestorm after Rajput's father lodged a police complaint, accusing Chakraborty of stealing his son's money and contributing to his suicide. He also denied that his son had any mental health issues. \nThe Rajput family has not commented on the latest developments regarding his death. \nChakraborty, who consistently denied all the allegations against her, appealed to the government to order a fair probe into the death. \nHowever, the tragedy - which came in the midst of a lockdown while India was struggling with the coronavirus pandemic - became the biggest prime-time story for a nation glued to their television sets. \nAnd Chakraborty became the subject of misogynistic abuse, with trolls calling her a \"witch\", a \"fortune huntress\", a \"mafia moll\" and \"sex bait to trap rich men\". She received rape and death threats.\nSome of India's most high-profile television hosts dedicated their entire shows to discussing the case, describing her as a \"manipulative\" woman who \"performed black magic\" and \"drove Sushant to suicide\". \nA video that went viral at the time showed a prominent news anchor hysterically gesticulating and accusing Chakraborty of being \"a druggie\". Another channel had a female anchor walk in on the live set, claiming she had \"a bagful of documents\" that could prove the actress's guilt. \nThe vicious hate campaign continued until Chakraborty was arrested three months after Rajput's death.\nShe was released a month later and has since tried her hand at motivational speaking and has now reinvented herself as a businesswoman who has launched a clothing line and her own podcast with celebrity interviews. She is also doing a reality TV show.\nChakraborty has also spoken about her ordeal, including how the name-calling and character assassination cost her work and how her family were also hounded. \n\"I tried contacting people in the [Hindi film] industry, asking for roles, any roles. But then I realised that people won't cast you because of all that had happened,\" she told Humans of Bombay last year. \n\"I was very angry for a long time. But it gave me acidity and I suffered from gut issues. So, it became important for me to forgive,\" she said, adding \" I have not forgiven everyone. Some people are on my hit list.\nIt is not clear what action she is contemplating against those who vilified her, but many are now suggesting on social media that she sue them for damages.\nWhile neither the actress or her lawyer have not yet said what they intend to do, columnist Namita Bhandare points out that seeking compensation in India, with its overburdened judiciary and millions of pending court cases, is anything but easy.\n\"A defamation case can go on for a decade and she would possibly get an apology at the end of it. So would she even bother to do that?\"\nAccording to Ms Bhandare, Chakraborty \"became expendable in the pursuit of a juicy story\" since she \"was not a big name and had no powerful people backing her in the film industry\".\nWhat happened, the columnist continued, \"was in keeping with the traditional Indian thinking\" to blame the female partner left behind, and also highlighted the \"dark side of social media, which tends to find a villain and then sets about demolishing their reputation\". \nSome of the videos of prominent news anchors making slanderous comments against Chakraborty have now resurfaced, and are being shared extensively on social media. Many people, including some of the actress's Bollywood colleagues, are demanding that the presenters apologise to her.\n\"You went on a witch-hunt. You caused deep anguish and harassment just for TRPs [a metric used to gauge advertising reach]. Apologise. That's the very least you can do,\" Bollywood actress Dia Mirza said on Instagram.\nJournalist Rohini Singh named specific TV channels and asked if they would apologise to Chakraborty. \n\"If they have any shame, any shred of human decency they should issue a grovelling apology for slandering her, telling outrageous lies, getting her imprisoned only because they were determined to run an agenda,\" she posted on X.\nThe issue was also raised in parliament on Tuesday. Journalist-turned-MP Sagarika Ghosh questioned the character assassination Chakraborty was subjected to.\n\"News channels ran motivated campaigns against her. Today she's proven innocent. But who will give those years back to her when she endured such humiliation at the hand of media?\" she asked.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook",

Ford snapped an inch-perfect cross-kick for Joe Carpenter to score out wide after putting Tom O'Flaherty in with blurringly quick hands.\nAfterwards, Sale boss Alex Sanderson was talking up Ford's potentially last shot at British and Irish Lions selection.\n\"If George plays like that in the next seven games, it would be very hard not to pick him,\" said Sanderson.\n\"You learn best from your peers and particularly in a Lions squad where you've got to bring people together, George is a brilliant character at doing that.\n\"He helps me out all the time with that.

Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.\nThese White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.\nThat an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.\nAnd that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.\n\"This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X.\nDemocratic congressman Chris Deluzio said in a press statement that the House Armed Services Committee, on which he sits, must conduct a full investigation and hearing on the matter as soon as possible.\n\"This is an outrageous national security breach, and heads should roll,\" he said.\nCriticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either.\nDon Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was \"unconscionable\".\n\"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,\" he said of Waltz's messaging. \"Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone.\"\nWith Republicans in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump's own party would have to initiate any kind of formal congressional investigation into the matter.\nRepublican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error.\n\"They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said. \"I don't know what else you can say about that.\"\nTrump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.\nThe White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz. \nBy Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.\nIn its afternoon statement, the White House noted that the strikes were \"highly successful and effective\". That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team.\nJD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen.\nWhile the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action.\nHe noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal.\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"\nThe vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\".\n\"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\nThis is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy.\nDick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky.\nThis is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines. Both Trump and Joe Biden were investigated for their possession of classified information after leaving office. Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for alleged violations related to his refusal to turn over material stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence \u2013 a case that was dropped when Trump won re-election last year.\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for communications while US secretary of state became a major issue during her unsuccessful presidential campaign.\nLike this White House group chat, some of those messages provided insight into the inner workings of Clinton's team.\nTheir revelation also proved to be political damaging. A handful of her stored messages were later deemed to contain \"top secret\" information.\n\"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign \u2013 one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law.\nOn Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" she wrote.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "From the Yorkshire Moors in England to the South African wilderness, star bathing is emerging as a transformative wellness trend \u2013 offering awe, calm and a cosmic reset.\nI lie in an empty Victorian bathtub on heather moorland in the Yorkshire Moors in England's north. Above me, more and more stars appear as the sky slowly darkens from blue to violet to navy. Beside me, in her own bathtub, my star-bathing guide Gemma leads a meditation.\n\"Allow yourself to be awed by the incredible sky view that you're witnessing,\" she says softly. \"Appreciate that we are here, right now, on this beautiful evening. Focus gently on the sky\u2026 and your breath. Just be.\"\u00a0\nI feel cold and self-conscious. I am trying to suspend the part of me that is deeply sceptical because I desperately want an escape from the anxiety that has plagued the past three years of my life. A search for relief has led me to wild swimming, drumming, yoga and now to star-bathing \u2013 an emerging wellness practice that is being offered in hotels and retreats around the world.\nStar bathing is not about identifying constellations, it's about losing yourself in the night sky; and a growing body of research suggests that it can help calm the nervous system, increase happiness and foster a sense of perspective.\nSo here I am, wrapped in blankets, on a weekend of stargazing run by Broughton Sanctuary, a 16th-Century historic house and collection of cottages located at the foothills of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, a designated International Dark Sky Reserve. There is a strong focus on the healing power of nature here \u2013 the 3,000-acre grounds are home to one of the UK's largest rewilding projects \u2013 and star bathing is just one of many activities designed to bring guests closer to the natural world.\nThe meditation ends and silence falls on the moors, broken by the distant hoot of an owl. I look up, trying not to think about the stressful week I've had. As the sky continues to darken, new stars appear as though by magic. My breathing slows. Suddenly I feel something shift. I realise that I am not just looking up at the universe, I am part of the universe. It is impossible not to feel awed by the vastness and beauty of the night sky above me.\nThe psychological benefits of experiencing awe are well documented \u2013 it has been proven to lower heart rate, increase the presence of oxytocin and reduce inflammation \u2013 and it's one of the reasons that stargazing is so good for our mental health.\n\"Experiencing awe regularly is deeply beneficial for our mental wellbeing because it helps us to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves,\" says Mark Westmoquette, an astrophysicist and yoga and meditation teacher who runs mindful stargazing retreats across the UK and Europe. \"As we look up at the night sky and become aware of our place within it, that sense of wonder and awe can really shift our perspective around who and what we are.\"\nWhile the mental health benefits of being in nature are well documented, it's only recently that researchers have begun to study the effects of being in a nocturnal natural environment.\nIn February 2024, a new Night Sky Connectedness Index was published in the\u00a0Journal of Environmental Psychology. It showed that a greater connection to the night sky is positively related to a person's mental health and happiness. The Office of Astronomy for Development, a joint project of the International Astronomical Union and the South African National Research Foundation, is currently researching the potential of using astronomy as a tool to improve vulnerable people's mental wellbeing, with encouraging results.\nAt the end of our star-bathing session, Gemma, me and the other two participants drink hot chocolate and then make our way down the hillside. We can't take our eyes off the sky, which becomes more and more dazzling the longer we look at it.\nWell World\nBBC Travel's\u00a0Well World is a global take on wellness that explores different ways that cultures the world over strive for a healthy lifestyle.\nThe following night, after a day spent exploring the grounds, relaxing in the spa and wild swimming in a freezing cold former reservoir on the estate, I take part in a stargazing session that is part of the annual Dark Skies Festival. After eating a two-course vegetarian meal around a bonfire in the \"fire temple\" \u2013 a sheltered wooden structure set in pretty woodland \u2013 a group of about 20 of us walk to Broughton's kitchen garden where astronomer Chris Higgins is waiting with a powerful telescope.\nHiggins talks us through various constellations and planets, and we take it in turns to look at them through the telescope. I am awestruck by the sight of Venus, which appears like a crescent moon, as well Jupiter with its four moons and its light and dark bands.\nThe group bonds quickly \u2013 our natural reserve seems to disappear as we ooh and aah at the cosmos. It's a freezing night, but no one wants to go inside. It feels like a gift \u2013 this clear, beautiful night \u2013 and we can't stop staring at the sky. After a while, I let go of trying to understand the science and just gaze up, letting the cool light of the stars calm me. I love the idea that while almost everything on our planet has changed since the beginning of humanity, the beauty of the night sky has remained the same. I am staring up at the same view my ancestors marvelled at, and there is something deeply grounding about that.\nI am hooked. When I return home, I start searching for star-bathing retreats. At the top of my wish-list is luxury off-grid retreat centre Bliss & Stars, located two hours from the nearest village in South Africa's Cederberg Wilderness Area. Launched in 2019 by Daria and Heine Rasmussen, it offers three-night star-bathing retreats, featuring guided stargazing sessions, nature immersion, mindfulness, breathwork under the stars and night hikes.\u00a0\nDaria tells me that many visitors have profound experiences gazing at the night sky. \"One guest, numbed by years of trauma, experienced a breakthrough while observing Saturn's rings, describing it as 'awe as exorcism' that rebooted his capacity for joy,\" she says. \"Another guest, a grieving mother, found solace in our wilderness night ventures and naked-eye stargazing, saying: 'It felt like the universe was mourning with me.'\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The seven travel trends that will shape 2025\n\u2022\u00a0Five extraordinary night-time experiences around the world\n\u2022\u00a0Swede dreams: How Sweden is embracing its sleepy side\u00a0\u00a0\nAlso high on my bucket list is Chile's Atacama Desert, which features the world's darkest, clearest skies. Elqui Domos Hotel has been designed specifically for appreciating these pristine night skies \u2013 it features geodesic rooms with retractable roofs to allow guests to look straight up from their bed. Hotel Ranga in Iceland, meanwhile, features a state-of-the-art observatory, and offers the chance to take part in mindful stargazing from outdoor hot tubs fed by geothermally heated water.\nIn the Scottish Highlands, Cairngorm Excursions runs star-bathing parties, bringing people together for a night of stargazing far from any light pollution, with hot drinks, traditional stovies (a Scottish dish made from meat and potatoes), blankets and log seating. This being Scotland, the evenings also feature a gin, whisky and rum sampling experience put on by a local distillery.\nAboriginal Australians are thought to be the world's first astronomers, and a growing number of experiences offer visitors a chance to learn about Indigenous astronomy. Aboriginal-owned Ngurrangga Tours offers an overnight trip in Western Australia's Millstream Chichester National Park with an evening of camping, exploring the wilderness and learning about Indigenous star stories. In Sydney, Fantasea Cruising offers an Aboriginal Sky Dreaming Cruise on the harbour, with an Aboriginal astronomer sharing stories of the Sun, Moon and stars that have been passed down by ancestors.\u00a0\nFor now, I go out into my Bristol garden on clear nights and lie down on a blanket. The sky is nowhere near as dark as it was in Yorkshire, and light pollution obscures many of the stars, but I find that I can still slip into that now familiar sense of peace.\nPerhaps it doesn't matter how many stars I can see.

A search for relief has led me to wild swimming, drumming, yoga and now to star-bathing \u2013 an emerging wellness practice that is being offered in hotels and retreats around the world.Star bathing is not about identifying constellations, it's about losing yourself in the night sky; and a growing body of research suggests that it can help calm the nervous system, increase happiness and foster a sense of perspective.So here I am, wrapped in blankets, on a weekend of stargazing run by Broughton Sanctuary, a 16th-Century historic house and collection of cottages located at the foothills of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, a designated International Dark Sky Reserve.

I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"\nHegseth reciprocated:\n\"I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"\nA group member, only identified as \"SM\" suggested that after the strike, the US should \"make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return\".\n\"If Europe doesn't remunerate, then what?\" he asked.\n\"If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,\" the user continues.\nAccording to Goldberg, the US national security chief posted three emojis after the strike: \"a fist, an American flag, and fire\".\nThe Middle East special envoy, Steve Witkoff, responded with five emojis, Goldberg said: \"two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags\".\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles voiced messages of support, he said. \n\"I will say a prayer for victory,\" Vance said as updates on the strikes were given. \nTwo others members added prayer emojis, Goldberg reported.\nTo Vance's concerns that the action may be seen as going against Trump's message on Europe, the US defence secretary wrote: \n\"VP: I understand your concerns \u2013 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS [Trump].

        "article_text": "When Jeffrey Goldberg published a bombshell story outlining how some of the most senior US officials had mistakenly shared sensitive information with him, he obtained the biggest scoop of the year. The Atlantic editor also became the prime target for every senior Trump administration official in Washington.\nIn the last couple of days, he's been called a \"loser\" and a \"sleazebag\" by President Trump, as well as a liar and \"scum\" by US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, who appeared to have mistakenly added Goldberg to a group chat earlier this month.\nBefore he became a political lightning rod, however, Goldberg watched on his phone as cabinet officials - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard - discussed the sensitive details, timings and targets of an upcoming military operation in Yemen. They did not seem to notice his presence.\nIn an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, he told me it all began when he got a message on his phone, via the publicly available Signal messaging app, which allows users to send each other encrypted messages. It's popular among journalists and government officials. An account under Waltz's name had messaged him, which he assumed was a hoax.\n\"I wish there was a Le Carr\u00e9 quality here, you know,\" he said, referring to the late British spy novelist. \"But he asked me to talk. I said yes. And next thing I know, I'm in this very strange chat group with the national security leadership of the United States.\"\n\nAs the fall-out of the episode has engulfed Washington, Waltz has taken responsibility for mistakenly adding Goldberg to the group chat, suggesting that he meant to invite somebody else.\nHe has insisted that he has never met the editor, saying: \"I wouldn't know him if I bumped into him, if I saw him in a police lineup\". \nBy Goldberg's account, the two have actually met several times, though he declined to go into detail about their relationship.\n\"He can say obviously whatever he wants, but I'm not commenting on my relationship or non-relationship,\" Goldberg told me. \"As a reporter, I'm just not comfortable talking publicly about relationships that I may or may not have with people who are news makers.\"\nStill, one thing is clear: you must already have someone's contact information to reach them on Signal, and so Waltz had Goldberg's phone number. The top security adviser has said he has asked Elon Musk, tech billionaire and the White House's government efficiency czar, to investigate how the mistake happened - a move that was ridiculed by Goldberg.\n\"Really, you're going to put Elon Musk onto the question of how somebody's phone number ends up in someone's phone? I mean you know, most 8-year-olds could figure it out,\" he said.\nThe bigger question? \"Should you, as national security officials, be doing this on Signal on your phone?\" Goldberg said.\nIn his Monday Atlantic story - the first to report his access to the chat - Goldberg withheld the precise details that were shared around the bombing mission that attacked Houthi rebel targets in Yemen on 14 March. But Trump administration officials downplayed the report, calling him a liar and challenging his claims that classified information was shared.\nAnd so two days later, the magazine printed the full text messages, including several from Hegseth that included operational specifics. I asked him if that was a tough decision to make.\n\"Once Donald Trump said there was nothing to see here, essentially, and once Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe said there was no sensitive information, no classified information, et cetera - we felt like, hm, we disagree,\" he said. \"They're saying that, and we're the ones who have the texts, so maybe people should see them.\"\nThere are text messages in the group chat - sent before the first wave of strikes - detailing exactly when F-18 fighter jets would take off, when the first bombs would drop on Houthi targets and when Tomahawk missiles were going be fired. Hegseth has pushed back, saying they were clearly not \"war plans\" and none of it was classified information.\nPresident Trump expressed his support for Hegseth on Wednesday, saying he was \"doing a great job\" and describing Goldberg as a \"sleazebag\". The White House has also attempted to argue that the information shared was not technically war planning. \nGoldberg did not appear swayed by their insults and claims. \n\"If Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, is texting me, telling me the attack was about to be launched on Yemen - telling me what kind of aircraft are going to be used, what kind of weapons are going to be used, and when the bombs are going to fall two hours after the text is received - that seems sensitive information, war-planning information to me,\" he said.\nThis isn't the first time that the veteran editor has been on the receiving end of Trump's ire: in 2020 he published a piece in The Atlantic where senior military officials quoted Trump as having referred to fallen American soldiers as \"suckers\" and \"losers\", something the president and his administration have vigorously denied.\nI asked him how he felt about the vitriolic personal attacks against him, coming from the very highest levels of the government.\n\"This is their move. You never defend, just attack,\" Goldberg said. \"So I'm sitting there, minding my own business. They invite me into this Signal chat and now they're attacking me as a sleaze bag, I don't even get it.\"\n\nTrump has, so far, been defending his national security team and doesn't seem inclined to sack anyone over what he is calling a press \"witch-hunt\". But Goldberg says there's a widespread feeling in the White House that Waltz made a serious error, as well as deeper concern about how the incident is being handled.\n\"If you're a Air Force captain, currently working with the CIA and the State Department, and you mishandled sensitive information the way that they've obviously mishandled sensitive information? You'd be fired, you'd be prosecuted,\" Goldberg said. \nHe said there is now some \"buzz\" among the ranks around the apparently differing accountability standards for leaders in the Trump administration.\nGoldberg didn't stick around in the chat for the fallout. He decided the responsible thing to do was to leave the group. Some journalists have expressed incredulity that he would voluntarily exit. \nBut what happens next will play out in the White House and Congress, where Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have demanded an investigation.\n\"There's a part of me that would love to see what else is happening in there. But there's a lot of different issues here related to law and ethics and all kinds of other issues that I really can't go into, \" Goldberg said. \"Believe me when I say that I made that decision with good advice from various parties.\"\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Oscar Piastri converted pole position to win the Chinese Grand Prix, as McLaren made it two wins from two races at the start of the season.\nLando Norris finished second to make it a McLaren one-two, with George Russell's Mercedes completing the top three.\nFerrari's Lewis Hamilton won the sprint race on Saturday but he and team-mate Charles Leclerc were both disqualified from the main grand prix.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions after the race in Shanghai.\nHow long do you think Red Bull will give Liam Lawson to get up to speed before contemplating a switch? - Jon\nIt rather looks as if their patience has already run out. Red Bull are to discuss Lawson's future this week, and there is a strong possibility he will be dropped for the next race in Japan.\nIf they go through with it, it will be regarded as a quite remarkable decision, which raises serious questions about the management at Red Bull Racing.\nTo understand why, let's rewind.\nIn May last year, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner decided to re-sign Sergio Perez on a two-year contract taking him to the end of 2026.\nThis was despite the fact that the Mexican was struggling as Max Verstappen's team-mate, and that the 2024 season looked to be going the same way as the year before - a bright start from Perez, and then an alarming slump in form.\nHorner could have brought in Carlos Sainz, who was a free agent following Ferrari's decision to sign Lewis Hamilton. But he remembered the tension between the Sainz and Verstappen camps when they were team-mates at Toro Rosso in 2015 and decided he did not want go there again.\nRe-signing Perez, Horner's theory went, would give him the confidence to recover his form.\nThe strategy failed spectacularly. Perez's performances fell off a cliff, and the team slumped to third in the constructors' championship despite Verstappen winning a fourth world title by 63 points.\nVerstappen only won twice in the final 14 races of the year because the car lost competitiveness and became difficult to drive. Hence Perez's struggles.\nBut Horner and Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko decided that Perez had had his day and they needed to make a change.\nThey paid him off - to the tune of many millions of dollars - and signed Lawson.\nThey picked the New Zealander over his much more experienced team-mate at the junior Racing Bulls team, Yuki Tsunoda, because they believed he had a mental toughness the Japanese lacked.\nLawson has had a dire start to the season. He qualified 18th at the season-opener in Melbourne, where he crashed out of the race, and last in both the sprint and grand prix in China, failing to make much progress in either event.\nBut Verstappen is also struggling - at least relatively. He is not hiding his belief that the car is the slowest of the top four teams - indeed he implied pretty strongly in China that he believed it may not be as fast as the Racing Bull.\nThe Red Bull is nervous on corner entry, has mid-corner understeer and is snappy on exits. And the team don't seem to know how to fix it.\nVerstappen likes a sharp front end, but he doesn't want the car to behave like this. But he can cope, and get a lap time out of it. Lawson cannot, at least not yet.\nLawson was talking in China as if he already knew the writing was on the wall.\n\"It's just (got) a very small window,\" he said. \"It's hard, you know \u2013 it's hard to drive, to get it in that window. I'd like to say that with time that'll come \u2013 I just don't have time to do that. It's something I need to get on top of.\"\nIf Red Bull drop him after two races, the management will have some serious explaining to do.\nIf signing him was the right decision in December, why is it the wrong decision now, they will be asked. If Tsunoda is the driver replacing him, the question becomes even starker.\nAnd if instead they choose Frenchman Isack Hadjar, who has impressed as Tsunoda's rookie team-mate in the first two grands prix, well, that's surely too early.\nEqually, if the first-order problem is the car - as it seems to be - why blame the driver?\nFor many in F1 there is an aphorism that sums up Red Bull's approach to their second seat: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\nLiam Lawson finished 12th in the Chinese Grand Prix, eight positions and nearly 55 seconds behind Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen\nAre Ferrari at fault for the double disqualification, or was it just unlucky and out of their control? \u2013 Ozan\nFormula 1 lives on the edge. To win, teams have to push their cars as close to the limit of the technical regulations as possible - because that is what everyone is doing.\nThe line between success and failure is so fine. And weight and ride height are two of the key performance differentiators.\nOne kilogram of extra weight in F1 costs approximately 0.035secs a lap. Multiply that by the 56 laps of the Chinese Grand Prix, for example, and it's two seconds of race time. Not a lot, but it could be the difference between winning and not, or one place higher or lower.\nThat's just to explain why cars are run to the edge. And when you run to the edge, mistakes can happen.\nIn the case of Ferrari on Sunday, Charles Leclerc's car was found to be 1kg underweight.\nFerrari ascribed this to the fact that they had switched to a one-stop strategy, so the car finished the race with less rubber on the tyres than had they run the expected two-stop, and that was the difference between being over the minimum weight limit and under.\nOf course, other teams also switched to a one-stop, without ending up underweight. But exactly the same thing happened to Mercedes with George Russell in Belgium last year when he was disqualified from victory.\nAs for Lewis Hamilton, his skid blocks had worn too much. Again, it's the sort of thing that can happen - indeed, it happened to Hamilton when he was at Mercedes in the 2023 US Grand Prix, and Leclerc in the same race.\nAgain, it's about pushing the margins. Generally with these current cars, the lower they can be run, the more downforce they can create, as long as teams can keep the aerodynamics stable.\nBut run them too low, and they risk wearing the floor excessively - and that's what happened.\nThese things are generally not deliberate. They are just what can happen when pushing performance to the edge.\nAside from the McLaren, who has impressed you the most at this very early stage? \u2013 SJM\nRacing Bulls have had a very strong start to the season. Tsunoda qualified fifth in Australia, and his team-mate Hadjar was seventh on the grid and Tsunoda ninth in China.\nThe races have gone a bit wrong so far, but the car looks strong - in China, Verstappen was even implying it was better than the Red Bull.\nRacing Bulls use a fair few Red Bull parts but since Red Bull have started struggling that is not necessarily the boost it was in theory a year or two ago, when the close relationship between the two teams was causing concern among rivals.\nIn the cockpit, Hadjar, notwithstanding his crash on the formation lap in Australia, has made a strong first impression.\nOverall, a very positive start to the year by the second Red Bull team.\nRacing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Yuki Tsunoda both finished the Chinese Grand Prix but outside of the points\nHow was there such a big gap between Lewis Hamilton's sprint pace and qualifying pace? Or how did the other drivers close the gap in such a short space of time? \u2013 Ash\nThere is a combination of reasons. Ferrari hit the ground running in China and landed on a decent set-up for sprint qualifying in the single practice session before it.\nOn top of that, Hamilton put in a brilliant performance on a track where he has always excelled to take pole.\nBut there was an element of underachievement from other teams involved.\nThe McLaren was the fastest car in China and Oscar Piastri was more comfortable in it than Lando Norris. Both made mistakes in sprint qualifying - so they ended up third and sixth on the grid.\nHamilton converted pole into a lead at the first corner and then used the benefit of free air to maximise his opportunity.\nHe drove superbly, but he was protected from Piastri for much of the race by Verstappen, who the Australian did not pass until four laps from the end, by which time Hamilton had built a lead too big to overhaul.\nThe teams can change their set-ups after the sprint and it looks as if, by the time of grand prix qualifying, a more natural order emerged.\nAs Hamilton put it: \"We had a pretty decent car in the sprint, and then we made some changes to try and move forward and improve the car, but it made it quite a bit worse, basically, going into qualifying - and then it was even worse in the race.\"\nAmong those changes seems to have been lifting the car slightly, which Hamilton more or less confirmed after the race: \"I don't know who said we lifted the car, but we made some other changes, mostly, as well as that, but not massively, just small amounts.\"\nThey did not work - team-mate Leclerc was faster than Hamilton in the grand prix even though he had a damaged front wing. And the changes were not enough to stop Hamilton's car wearing the skid blocks too much. Hence his disqualification.\nThrow in Leclerc's disqualification for his car being underweight and it was a bad day at the office for Ferrari.\nWhy do teams put a board out from the pit wall as the drivers go through; surely all information is passed by the radio or telemetry? \u2013 Phil\nPit boards are there to give non-essential information relating to the drivers - primarily laps remaining. The gap to the drivers in front and behind are often also included.\nThey're also there as a back-up in case the radio fails.\nIt is, to a degree, a hangover from the past. But it's also simple and effective and there is no reason to stop doing it and plenty of reasons to continue.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\n'McLaren the class of the field but have hard tightrope to walk'\nObituary: Eddie Jordan, the flamboyant deal-maker of Formula 1\nChinese Grand Prix Review\nEddie Jordan Tribute",

This time, official communication to domestic teams didn't arrive, in some cases, until 20 minutes before the squad was confirmed.\nThe reasons for such secrecy remains unclear, though the approach does lend itself to preventing news leaking before the official announcement.\nPerhaps the most significant change for the players has been Tuchel's move to naming his starting XI on a matchday.\nSouthgate usually named his team the night before a fixture - while many players knew the XI based on the shape and personnel deployed in training.\nBut, for Friday's game against Albania, the players were informed of the team during a noon meeting on the day of the match.\nFor Monday's qualifier against Latvia, sources have indicated the players didn't know the full starting XI until about 16:00 - less than four hours before the game.\nCertain clues from training have also proved red herrings.

Tuchel is determined to build on that existing camaraderie.\nIndeed, the England head coach stressed the importance of relationships in his first address to the team on Monday night.\nIn his opening speech, Tuchel reiterated they have just 24 training sessions together before USA 2026 gets under way.\nTo that end, the former Chelsea boss admitted he would not be making drastic changes to the playing style Southgate had developed.\nBased on the opening training sessions, it quickly became apparent that Tuchel would employ a four-man defence - despite conjecture the German would use a three-at-the-back system he relied on successfully at Chelsea.\nThe overriding message of Tuchel's address, though, was one of triumph and history.\n\"He said the goal was to put another star on the jersey,\" divulged Burn last week.\n\nThis video can not be played\nWhy you shouldn't want Tuchel's England peaking now\nWatch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer\nAn exciting start or lots of work needed?

Similarly, the England players have been split on the merits of Tuchel's remarks.\nTime will tell whether Tuchel can fulfil his mission by lifting the World Cup in 16 months' time.\nIf he does, he will be doing it his way.",

        "article_text": "For the past 48 hours, top White House officials have faced questions from lawmakers and the press about how a journalist came to join a sensitive group chat for an upcoming military operation - and why President Donald Trump's national security team was sharing sensitive information in an unsecure manner.\nThe Atlantic first reported details of the group chat on the platform Signal after its editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to it. He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\nThe Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March air raids. \nWhile the thread appears to have contained sensitive information, there is still much that remains unknown. Here are four lingering questions regarding so-called \"Signal-gate\".\nThe Trump administration maintains the information shared in the chat was not classified.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that \"no war plans\" were discussed on the chat. Instead, she characterised the information shared as  \"sensitive policy discussions\".\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that the Signal chat was \"candid and sensitive\", though \"no classified information was shared\".\nBut under questioning, she and CIA Director John Ratcliffe appeared uncertain about the classification of the attack plan. They later emphasised that Hegseth had the power to classify and declassify the type of details that were shared. \nHegseth has denied sharing classified material, but experts are sceptical that this type of sensitive information would not carry that kind of designation.\nJamil Jaffer, executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University, said that Hegseth did not send \"an operational plan for World War Three, or for the Pacific region\".\n\"But at the same time,\" Mr Jaffer said, \"these are operational details that could, if released publicly, put American lives at risk or jeopardise the success of the operation.\"\nIn his original article, Mr Goldberg reports that on 11 March he initially \"received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz\", Trump's national security adviser.\nTwo days later, he writes that he received a notice that he was to be included in a Signal group titled the \"Houthi PC small group.\"\nMr Goldberg reports that the group received a message from Waltz, which also noted one of his deputies was \"pulling together\" a team of top staffers relevant to the discussion. \nOn Tuesday, Trump suggested that a \"lower level\" staffer for Waltz added Mr Goldberg to the chat.\nHowever, Waltz himself told Fox News' Laura Ingraham: \"I take full responsibility. I built the - I built the group.\"\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in the group, said on Wednesday that someone had made a \"mistake\" in adding Mr Goldberg.\nIt remains to be seen whether the Republican-controlled Congress will launch oversight investigations.\nRepublican lawmakers have emphatically supported the Trump administration's agenda to this point, so it seems improbable that they would support investigations into the Signal chat.\nDemocrats in the House are reportedly trying to force a vote on a \"Resolution of Inquiry\" that would require the Trump administration to hand over records related to the incident, according to Reuters, but they do not have a majority. \nWhile some Republicans have raised concerns over the leak, few have appeared eager to cross the president. \nThe use of Signal to discuss the Houthi strikes posed broader questions about how Trump's top staffers are sharing and discussing sensitive information.\nGabbard testified on Wednesday that Signal came \"pre-installed on government devices\".\nShe cited guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which mentioned Signal as an example of a messaging service with end-to-end encryption.\nRatcliffe earlier testified to Congress that Signal had been installed on his devices when he took over the CIA.\nBut it remains uncertain if security officials had provided guidance about using Signal for discussing military operations like the strikes against the Houthis.\n\"Whether these circumstances were approved or not is still not clear,\" Mr Jaffer said.\nCBS News, the BBC's US partner, has reported that the US National Security Agency had warned employees against using Signal due to \"a vulnerability\" that they had identified.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

The two sides also committed to negotiating the first phase of a trade agreement by autumn 2025. \nThe Trump administration has repeatedly accused India of being a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties in the past. \nIndia has recently lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products, but the balance of trade is still stacked heavily in its favour, with Delhi enjoying a $45bn trade surplus. \nIndia's average tariffs of around 12% are also significantly higher than the US's 2%.\nOfficials have not spoken publicly about the contours of the trade talks, but Reuters has reported that India could be considering slashing tariffs on more than half of US imports worth $23bn in the first phase of a trade deal to avoid Trump's reciprocal action. \nTrump had previously said he wanted to charge countries tit-for-tat tariffs whereby the US would impose exactly the same charges that other countries imposed on it.\nBut on Monday, he suggested the White House might be \"nicer than that\". \n\"We may take less than what they're charging, because they've charged us so much, I don't think they could take it,\" he said, while also acknowledging that some countries might be spared from the measures.",

        "article_text": "On 3 May Australians will head to the polls to vote in their first federal election since 2022. \nThe results will determine who the next prime minister will be, as well as the make-up of the nation's parliament.\nAustralia famously has a unique electoral system - and some quirky polling day traditions. Voting is mandatory for all citizens over 18, the country uses preferential voting, and picking up a \"democracy sausage\" is a polling day custom.\nAlmost 18 million people are registered to vote in this election - roughly 98% of those who are eligible. \nUnlike the First Past the Post system - used in the UK and most US states - which elects candidates based on who has received the greatest number of votes in a single count, regardless of whether they've secured an absolute majority - voters in Australia rank candidates in order of preference. \nIf no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are then redistributed, and that process repeated until someone secures a majority.\nIn races for the House of Representatives, voters are required to mark a preference down for every single candidate listed on the ballot. \nHowever, in Senate races, voters only need to mark down a designated number of preferences. \nIt is the leader of the party that receives the most seats in the House who then becomes prime minister. There is no separate leadership ballot. \nAll of the seats in Australia's House of Representatives - that's 150 in this election -will be up for grabs, as will 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate. \nAustralia has two major parties: the left-leaning Australian Labor Party and the conservative Liberal-National coalition. \nOne party needs to win at least 76 seats in the House to form a majority government.\nIf it cannot do that, it must try to win support from minor parties or independent MPs. \nIn both state and federal elections, the vote share for minor parties and independents has been steadily increasing in Australia for decades. \nThat reached record levels in the 2022 federal election, with one in three Australians casting votes for candidates outside the two major parties.\nLabor formed a majority government after winning the 2022 election, which delivered the biggest loss for the Liberal Party since its inception. \nAs it stands, Labor has 78 seats in the House of Representatives, while the coalition has 57, with minor parties and independents splitting the remainder.\nBut with one House seat abolished, if Labor loses just two seats at this election it will be stripped of its majority in parliament.\nIn order to form a government in its own right, the coalition needs to win 19 seats, likely including many of those it lost to independent candidates during the 2022 vote. \nAnthony Albanese has been the prime minister since the last election, and a stalwart of parliament for almost 30 years.\nWhile he enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power in 2022, he has in recent times come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs and both antisemitism and Islamophobia.\nAlbanese is being challenged by Peter Dutton, who became head of the Liberal-National coalition after their 2022 defeat. He is contesting his first election as opposition leader. \nKnown as a staunch conservative, Dutton has years of experience in important ministerial portfolios - like defence and home affairs - but has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues.\nBoth the polling and the political messaging around this year's election indicate that cost of living is the biggest concern for many voters. \nSince the 2022 election, inflation - which is now slowing - has pushed up the prices of everyday essentials such as food and utilities, leaving many households feeling stretched. \nThe Albanese government has implemented a string of policies that it says are aimed at providing relief, such as keeping the cost of medications down, and offering tax cuts, energy rebates and rental assistance to those eligible.  \nHowever, Australia has raised interest rates 12 times since Albanese was elected in May 2022 - something that is done independently of government but seen to reflect their economic management - and that has put additional pressure on borrowers and those with mortgages across the country.\nHousing affordability will also be a key issue this election cycle, with several Australian cities among the most expensive in the world for homebuyers.\nHistorically, Australians are used to getting a result and knowing who will form government on election night. \nHowever, it is usually not the Australian Election Commission - the official body tasked with manually counting the votes - that declares this. \nInstead, the AEC provides what's known as an \"indicative count\" throughout the day, which media commentators, election experts and sometimes even the parties and candidates themselves then base their calls on.\nThe AEC does not formally declare a seat until it is confident the result will not change based on the number of uncounted votes, which can sometimes take days.

They're Bosnian Mountain Horses, descendants of domesticated horses that were released into the wild due to various reasons, from war to industrialisation, and have since been saved from extinction.\n\"Horses like this were once the backbone of the agricultural industry here,\" BBC Travel Show host Rajan Datar said in a recent episode on the region. \"But once tractors and modern machinery arrived, many farmers set their horses free to fend for themselves in the wild.\"\nBecause of their domesticated roots, the horses are less wary of humans than true wild horses, which has made them a draw for tourists but also\u00a0a source of tension. In winter, they can often be found licking salt from roads in the winter, becoming a danger both to drivers and themselves. They have also been known to raid local farms for food, destroying crops and stealing water from livestock. Many locals see them as a nuisance, and some farmers have even gone so far as to kill horses found on their land. A 2009 decision to protect the herds was rescinded in 2017 due to the overwhelming cost of the damage claims.\nYet, in recent years, attitudes have begun to shift. As tourism to the country has increased in the past two decades, so has visitor interest in the animals. Their nomadic nature means that local guides are necessary to view the horses, and a host of local tourism businesses have cropped up to meet this demand, creating a significant economic impact in this rural region.\nLocal community organisations, such as the Environmental Association of Borova Glava, have also stepped in to help care for the animals and mitigate conflicts. For volunteers like Zeljko Kristo, a spokesperson for the organisation, the horses also serve as a symbol of how the country has healed from the war, which raged from 1992 to 1995 following the breakup of Yugoslavia.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Will you be going on holiday to\u2026 Greenland next year?\n\u2022 Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\n\u2022 Are you really helping when you join an 'expedition tour'?\n\"Besides humans, horses also found themselves in an awkward situation because [of the war],\" he explained. \"Looking back, years have passed, and we managed to save them \u2013 but at the same time, we saved ourselves.\"\nFor travellers interested in seeing the horses, Livno is the best place to start. The animals are commonly found roaming the hills and valleys around this part of the country, but their movements can be unpredictable. To increase the chance of seeing them, it's highly recommended that visitors hire a guide, who will be more knowledgeable about the horses' movements and habits. Local tour companies also provide transportation from town to the more remote areas where the herds can be found. What's more, many of these businesses donate some of the proceeds from their tours to the care of the animals, ensuring they can continue to roam these wild landscapes for years to come.\n\u00a0--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "At a secret location away from prying eyes, Ukrainian engineers test a long-range drone called Raybird.  \nThe machine, which looks like a mini plane with wings, is placed on a launchpad, stretched like an arrow on a crossbow and then shot into the air.\nRaybird can fly non-stop for more than 20 hours and cover a distance of more than 1,000km (620 miles). It carries out reconnaissance missions, and can also destroy targets both on the frontline and deep inside Russia.\nAmong their targets are oil refineries and fuel depots.\nBut after Russia and Ukraine reached separate agreements with the US on a partial ceasefire, missions like these should stop.\nAs well as agreeing to a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea following talks this week in Saudi Arabia, the two countries committed to stop attacking each other's energy infrastructure \u2013 something that had theoretically already been agreed.\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine would implement these agreements immediately.\nHowever, Oleksiy from Skyeton, the company that develops the Raybird, doubts that Moscow would adhere to the ceasefire.\n\"[Russians punch you in the face, then the next day they make an agreement but ask to tie up your hands. So the possibility that they will continue fighting remains,\" explains Oleksiy.\nYet, this deal will also bring relief to Russia.\nIt's estimated that this year alone, Ukraine carried out more than 30 attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure using drones and other weapons. \nThey've recently hit some of the country's largest oil facilities, like the Ufa oil refinery about 1,500km (932 miles) from the front line and Tuapse plant in Krasnodar region.\nRussia's oil refining capacity has dropped by about 10% as a result of drone attacks, according to Reuters.\nAnd Moscow's recent decision to extend the ban on petroleum exports shows that they're feeling the pain.\nUkraine's arsenal to carry out deep strikes is only growing. President Zelensky recently announced that Ukrainian engineers have designed a drone that has a range of 3,000 km (1,860 miles). That means it could reach not only Moscow, but even locations in Siberia.\nKyiv also claims that it has developed turbojet powered \"missile-drones\". They fly at a much higher speed and so are harder to intercept.\nZelensky said Ukraine has successfully tested its first domestically made ballistic weapon and upgraded its cruise missile Neptune to hit ground as well as naval targets. This missile was reportedly used to attack the Russian air base in the southern city of Engels last week, although Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny these reports.\nThe energy ceasefire deal is certainly good news for Ukraine too. Russia has been relentlessly targeting its power plants and stations across the country. At one point last year, Ukraine's energy generation capacity dropped to a third of its pre-war level.\nLast month, when temperatures dropped below zero, Russian drones hit a thermal power plant in Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine. A few days later, another massive aerial attack left more than 250,000 residents of Odesa without power and heating.\nAnd lately, there has been a growing number of attacks on Ukraine's gas infrastructure. Among regular targets are underground gas storage facilities in western Ukraine and production facilities in the central and eastern parts of the country.\nMoscow's aim is to reduce gas production in Ukraine, which is key to the country's energy security, says Artem Petrenko, executive director of the Association of Gas Producers of Ukraine.\nAt the end of March, Gas storage facilities in Ukraine were only around 4% full, according to one monitoring group.\nAnd if Russia continues its strikes, filling up those storage facilities will be extremely challenging, potentially leading to massive problems next winter.\nBack at the testing ground, after several laps, the Raybird opens its parachutes and successfully lands in the field. \nOleksiy is satisfied with the results. He says that although it's good to have a ceasefire, they still cannot afford to pause their work and the development of new weapons.\n\"Our enemy just wants to have a break, gather its strength and attack again,\" he says. \"We must be ready for that.\"",

They've recently hit some of the country's largest oil facilities, like the Ufa oil refinery about 1,500km (932 miles) from the front line and Tuapse plant in Krasnodar region.Russia's oil refining capacity has dropped by about 10% as a result of drone attacks, according to Reuters.And Moscow's recent decision to extend the ban on petroleum exports shows that they're feeling the pain.Ukraine's arsenal to carry out deep strikes is only growing. Among regular targets are underground gas storage facilities in western Ukraine and production facilities in the central and eastern parts of the country.IGOR TKACHENKO/EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockRussia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022Moscow's aim is to reduce gas production in Ukraine, which is key to the country's energy security, says Artem Petrenko, executive director of the Association of Gas Producers of Ukraine.At the end of March, Gas storage facilities in Ukraine were only around 4% full, according to one monitoring group.And if Russia continues its strikes, filling up those storage facilities will be extremely challenging, potentially leading to massive problems next winter.Back at the testing ground, after several laps, the Raybird opens its parachutes and successfully lands in the field.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMeet the man who convinced Nike to take a gamble on Michael Jordan\nThere were 15 seconds left on the clock when a 19-year-old college basketball player launched a 16-foot winning shot that would change sports marketing forever.  \nWatching that day was marketing executive and grassroots promoter Sonny Vaccaro. He was so impressed by what he saw that two years later he would bet his job at sports manufacturer Nike on backing this relatively untested player.\nThat player was Michael Jordan.\nBut not the Jordan we know now. At the point Vaccaro witnessed him score the shot that won the 1982 NCAA championship for North Carolina Tar Heels, Jordan was                 just a freshman.\nWhen, two years later, Vaccaro urged his bosses to spend their whole yearly basketball endorsement budget on him, Jordan was only 21 and had never competed in the NBA. And no-one was talking about his footwear.\nVaccaro says his conviction in the youngster's potential was forged the moment he watched him take that shot at the Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans.\n\"That shot changed the world because of what Michael Jordan became,\" the 85-year-old told BBC Sport. \n\"When he took the shot, it convinced me that he would take any shot in the world.\"\nBut it was Vaccaro who had to take a shot first. \nIn his memoir, Legends and Soles, he describes how he had to convince his bosses to take a chance on an up-and-coming star, while competitors such as Converse were endorsing household names including Earvin 'Magic' Johnson.\nBy that time, Vaccaro had established himself as a basketball insider with an extensive knowledge of young players. In 1964, aged 24, he established The Dapper Dan Roundball Classic - the first national high school all-star basketball game.\nThe tournament ran under different guises until 2007, showcasing future NBA stars including Moses Malone, LeBron James, Kevin Garnett, Kevin Love, Kobe Bryant, Patrick Ewing and Shaquille O'Neal.\nHe also founded the ABCD basketball summer camp in 1984 - an invitational that gathered the country's highest-ranked high school players.\nNevertheless, Vaccaro told BBC Sport former Nike boss Phil Knight was not satisfied with the Jordan proposal \"until the last minute\".\nTheir gamble turned the company's fortunes around, transformed the way basketball was viewed globally and left an indelible print on sneaker culture worldwide. The story was popularised in 2023 film Air, in which Vaccaro is played by Matt Damon.\nIn his book, as well as detailing the Jordan deal, he describes how he was able to spot the potential in future stars including Bryant, Tracy McGrady and James, whom he narrowly missed out on signing to an endorsement in 2003.\nNike's offer to Jordan in 1984 included a guaranteed $250,000 a year for five years, plus a stake in his own line of merchandise. It would make the 21-year-old, who was the third pick in the NBA draft that year, one of the richest athletes in the world.\nAfter signing that deal, Jordan went on to become arguably the greatest NBA player of all time, winning six championships, six Finals MVPs, five regular-season MVPs and a record 10 scoring titles.\nHis partnership with Nike also catapulted the franchise from a company that mainly dealt in running shoes into a global behemoth worth just under $30bn, external (\u00a323bn), with a monopoly over the NBA.\n\"My personal opinion is that if there is no Michael Jordan, you wouldn't even be talking about a Nike shoe company,\" Vaccaro said. \n\"That's the one deal that changed America's view of basketball players and endorsements. He was magnetic.\n\"Other people had endorsements with companies and they'd hold up a shoe and say: 'Wear this, I wear this.' Michael didn't have to hold up the shoe. He took the shot and then wore the shoe.\"\nThe Air Jordan shoe, designed by Peter Moore, first retailed in 1985. By 1986, $100m, external worth of Air Jordan shoes and products had been sold.\nA pair of championship trainers worn by Jordan sold for $8m (\u00a36.3m) at auction last year.\nThis video can not be played\nHow a young Kobe Bryant grabbed Vaccaro's attention in 1994\nIn 1993, Vaccaro joined Adidas America. For the next decade, he battled with his former employer for the signatures of the nation's hottest up-and-coming NBA stars.\nOne of the coups Vaccaro managed during his time with the German sportswear company was to sign 18-year-old Bryant to a $5m, five-year deal in 1996, a month before he entered the NBA straight from high school.\nThe marketer first encountered the future five-time NBA champion when he was invited to play at one of Vaccaro's ABCD camps in 1994.\n\"It took Kobe all of a week to blast to the top of my 'gifted' list,\" he writes. \"Competing against the top 160 American players, along with a handful of prospects from places like China, France, Australia, Canada and Russia, Kobe was intimidated by no-one.\"\nWhat left a lasting impression on Vaccaro was the fact Bryant approached him at the end of the week to apologise for not having won the MVP award, despite only being 16.\n\"I knew that this kid had that hidden thing - drive, an ambition and a belief in himself,\" he told BBC Sport. \"He was the most confident, outward person I've ever been around in my life.\"\nBryant returned to Vaccaro's summer camp the following year and won the MVP award.\nIn 1997, Vaccaro signed McGrady, just as he was about to enter the NBA draft from high school as the ninth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors.\nMcGrady, who would go on to become a seven-time NBA All-Star, had made an impression on the sports marketer at the 1996 ABCD camp. However, he almost was not included after his school coach kicked him off the team and advised Vaccaro not to deal with the youngster.\n\"We invited Tracy because of all the backlash,\" Vaccaro said. \"Those five days at camp changed the whole world. He was voted the number one player in camp. No-one knew his name!\"\nThe story of Vaccaro's life seems to hinge on a number of these serendipitous moments.\n\"What if those people in Pittsburgh were to say no to me and the Dapper Dan in 1964?\" he said. \"One no and this life is over. You'd be looking for someone else to interview.\"",

        "article_text": "A discussion by high-ranking US security officials about US air strikes on Yemen has been published in full by the Atlantic magazine.\nThe group chat on the Signal app mistakenly included the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.\nAfter holding back some excerpts of the chat in an earlier article, he decided on Wednesday to publish almost the entire exchange after senior officials insisted there was no classified information shared in the group. \nThose statements \"have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions\", Goldberg wrote. \nThe messages, however, need some unpicking. Here are three of them with some analysis.\nThese messages provide details of the US military's plan for the Yemen strikes - described as a \"package\", a military term which refers to a set of aircraft, weapons systems and intelligence gathering devices that will participate in an operation. \n\"The idea this wasn't classified information at the time is inconceivable,\" Glenn Gerstell, the former general counsel of the National Security Agency (NSA), told the BBC. \nHe added that it may have been declassified afterwards but any imminent military action involving American troops would have been classified at the time it was shared.\n\nThe messages from Hegseth note what time F-18 fighter aircraft are scheduled to launch, as well as when strikes will take place and in what timeframe \"trigger-based\" attacks could occur. \nIn this context, \"trigger\" refers to a set of parameters that have to be acknowledged before weapons are deployed. It could be a visual reference point, like a mobile phone lighting up. \nThis information is considered highly sensitive. \nPhilip Ingram, a former military intelligence officer with the British Army, told the BBC that similar information \"falls firmly into the bracket of what would have been classified top secret\".\n\"You can practically plot where the aircraft are going to come from,\" he added. \nIn the wake of the chat's revelations, the White House and other US officials have argued that this information does not constitute a \"war plan\". \nIn a post on X, Hegseth said: \"The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods.\"\nIn this part of the group chat, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz provides an update on the strike - which in military parlance is called a battle damage assessment, or BDA. \nWaltz notes that the target building has collapsed, and that the US military had earlier had positive identification of the target - a Houthi \"missile guy\" - walking into the building, which was believed to be his girlfriend's residence. \n\nIn his message, Waltz congratulates Pete - referring to Hegseth, as well as the IC, shorthand for \"intelligence community\" and Kurilla, a reference to Michael Kurilla, a US Army General who oversees Central Command, a regional combatant command with responsibility over the Middle East and parts of Central and South Asia. \nThe messages do not reveal how the target's whereabouts or movements were tracked. \nA military expert contacted by the BBC - but who wished to remain nameless - suggested that a combination of aerial platforms, technological tracking capabilities or human intelligence on the ground could have been used, or a combination of various sources. \nAt least 53 people were killed in the initial wave of US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, which struck more than 30 targets  including training facilities, drone infrastructure, as well as weapons manufacturing and storage sites and command and control centres, including one in which the Pentagon said several unmanned aerial vehicle experts were located. \nIt is unclear which of the targets Waltz was referring to in the group chat. \nAnother potentially sensitive message comes from Joe Kent, a former special operations soldier and failed congressional candidate who was nominated by Trump to be the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center. \nIn his message, Kent refers to Israel carrying out their own strikes. \nThe Israeli military has repeatedly struck Houthi targets in Yemen since the beginning of the war in Gaza, in retaliation for Houthi missile and drone attacks on Israeli targets conducted in support of Hamas. \nThe most recent attacks took place on 19 and 26 December of last year. \nAccording to Kent, the Israeli government would seek to \"replenish\" any weapons stocks used in further raids, although he believes that to be a \"minor factor\". \nA slightly more sensitive message follows from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who notes that the US is  \"mobilising assets\" to help a strike, but that a delay would \"not negatively impact\" the agency's work in Yemen. \n\"Additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership,\" he wrote.\nAssets, in this context, could refer to CIA-run spies on the ground in Yemen, or technological means such as surveillance drone flights. \nMick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence and ex-CIA paramilitary officer, said that Ratcliffe's message was very sensitive. \n\"Essentially, we don't want to share where the CIA is focused,\" he added. \nRatcliffe told a House hearing on Wednesday that he did not transmit classified information.\n(With additional reporting from Nomia Iqbal and Ruth Comerford)",

        "article_text": "Like most of us, guitarist Raymond Meade had a slow and quiet summer in 2021.\nThe pandemic had put a stop to live touring with Ocean Colour Scene, with whom he had played since 2016.\nAnd without recording studios, he was unable to continue with his successful solo career.\nBut there was a further barrier for the bassist, who has been playing since he was in school.\n\"I'd started to get these really intense pins and needles in my hands. It was like throwing a snowball and then running your hands under hot water afterwards. It's really painful and hot.\"\n\"And then it spread to my feet.\"\nIn August that year, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) which affects the central nervous system.\n\"It was almost a relief to have the diagnosis because it allowed me to make the necessary adjustments and get on with my life.\"\nBut he was also concerned that his professional career might be over.\n\"The day they told me I had MS, I thought I was done. I wasn't even 40 at that point and I thought I'd have to sell my guitars and find some other way to make a living.\n\"But the neurologist said, 'Give it time'.\"\nWithin two months, he was on a new treatment, and ready to leave hospital.\nOcean Colour Scene had just announced their first tour in almost two years \u2013 and Meade was keen to be part of it.\n\"My hands didn't work. I couldn't tie my laces. I couldn't do a zip up - I was dropping everything. \n\"To have something to aim for was important.\"\nHe called the other band members - Simon Fowler, Steve Cradock and Oscar Harrison - and told them what had happened.\n\"I said I was aware that I might not get back to the level of being able to perform live, but they just said 'Get fit, see you in December'.\"\nThe gig in the band's home city of Birmingham was an emotional one, for them and the audience.\nBut Meade was just focused on getting through the set.\n\"I had a stool hidden behind an amp and I thought if I can get through this without sitting down, I'll be doing ok.\nIn the end I didn't need it. And there was this outpouring of emotion. It was such a terrible time and it was a release to get back to playing live music.\"\n\"We all had a hug when we came off stage.\"\nHaving returned to live touring, Meade had another challenge to face. Making his own music.\n\"I couldn't hold a pen \u2013 which means I can't do my crossword either. My head was just scrambled with too much information. I made the mistake of googling MS and I was just swamped with information. \n\"The thing to remember is that no one - with my brain - has ever had this before so I needed to find out what's right for me.\"\nHe started to train his brain with games like chess, and slowly the songwriting abilities returned.\nThe result is his first new single since his diagnosis, Holy Water, which has been released on Alan McGee's new label Creation Youth.\nFor a boy who grew up in the southside of Glasgow, idolising Oasis, and later ran Liam Gallagher's clothes label Pretty Green, it was a dream moment.\n\"I used to send him demo cassettes. It's a full circle moment. And to be writing again and to have that music released by Alan McGee meant everything.\"\n\"I'd never thought I'd get back to playing with the band and writing my own music, being able to record it and being at a level that Alan McGee finds it worthy of releasing.\"\nThis week he and the rest of Ocean Colour Scene kick off their latest tour in Leeds. The band whose hits include The Riverboat Song and The Day We Caught the Train will play two dates at Glasgow's 02 Academy on 15 and 16 April.\nAnother dream come true for the boy who saw the band as a teenager at the Glasgow Barrowlands.\nAnd he's planning it carefully.\n\"My neurologist said you need to think when you wake up that you have an allocation of energy tokens and be careful how you use them. I'm an expert napper. If I'm doing something in the evening, I lay off in the day to balance the fatigue. It's manageable.\"\n\"I found out that the actress Jamie Linn Sigler from the Sopranos had MS all the way through the show. It didn't stop her. I get fans coming up all the time to say their mum, or their uncle has MS.\n\"I want to be an example that it's not the end if you get it. It's manageable. Lean on the MS nurses. You can carry on with your life. You can still be you.\"",

        "article_text": "From the Yorkshire Moors in England to the South African wilderness, star bathing is emerging as a transformative wellness trend \u2013 offering awe, calm and a cosmic reset.\nI lie in an empty Victorian bathtub on heather moorland in the Yorkshire Moors in England's north. Above me, more and more stars appear as the sky slowly darkens from blue to violet to navy. Beside me, in her own bathtub, my star-bathing guide Gemma leads a meditation.\n\"Allow yourself to be awed by the incredible sky view that you're witnessing,\" she says softly. \"Appreciate that we are here, right now, on this beautiful evening. Focus gently on the sky\u2026 and your breath. Just be.\"\u00a0\nI feel cold and self-conscious. I am trying to suspend the part of me that is deeply sceptical because I desperately want an escape from the anxiety that has plagued the past three years of my life. A search for relief has led me to wild swimming, drumming, yoga and now to star-bathing \u2013 an emerging wellness practice that is being offered in hotels and retreats around the world.\nStar bathing is not about identifying constellations, it's about losing yourself in the night sky; and a growing body of research suggests that it can help calm the nervous system, increase happiness and foster a sense of perspective.\nSo here I am, wrapped in blankets, on a weekend of stargazing run by Broughton Sanctuary, a 16th-Century historic house and collection of cottages located at the foothills of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, a designated International Dark Sky Reserve. There is a strong focus on the healing power of nature here \u2013 the 3,000-acre grounds are home to one of the UK's largest rewilding projects \u2013 and star bathing is just one of many activities designed to bring guests closer to the natural world.\nThe meditation ends and silence falls on the moors, broken by the distant hoot of an owl. I look up, trying not to think about the stressful week I've had. As the sky continues to darken, new stars appear as though by magic. My breathing slows. Suddenly I feel something shift. I realise that I am not just looking up at the universe, I am part of the universe. It is impossible not to feel awed by the vastness and beauty of the night sky above me.\nThe psychological benefits of experiencing awe are well documented \u2013 it has been proven to lower heart rate, increase the presence of oxytocin and reduce inflammation \u2013 and it's one of the reasons that stargazing is so good for our mental health.\n\"Experiencing awe regularly is deeply beneficial for our mental wellbeing because it helps us to feel connected to something bigger than ourselves,\" says Mark Westmoquette, an astrophysicist and yoga and meditation teacher who runs mindful stargazing retreats across the UK and Europe. \"As we look up at the night sky and become aware of our place within it, that sense of wonder and awe can really shift our perspective around who and what we are.\"\nWhile the mental health benefits of being in nature are well documented, it's only recently that researchers have begun to study the effects of being in a nocturnal natural environment.\nIn February 2024, a new Night Sky Connectedness Index was published in the\u00a0Journal of Environmental Psychology. It showed that a greater connection to the night sky is positively related to a person's mental health and happiness. The Office of Astronomy for Development, a joint project of the International Astronomical Union and the South African National Research Foundation, is currently researching the potential of using astronomy as a tool to improve vulnerable people's mental wellbeing, with encouraging results.\nAt the end of our star-bathing session, Gemma, me and the other two participants drink hot chocolate and then make our way down the hillside. We can't take our eyes off the sky, which becomes more and more dazzling the longer we look at it.\nWell World\nBBC Travel's\u00a0Well World is a global take on wellness that explores different ways that cultures the world over strive for a healthy lifestyle.\nThe following night, after a day spent exploring the grounds, relaxing in the spa and wild swimming in a freezing cold former reservoir on the estate, I take part in a stargazing session that is part of the annual Dark Skies Festival. After eating a two-course vegetarian meal around a bonfire in the \"fire temple\" \u2013 a sheltered wooden structure set in pretty woodland \u2013 a group of about 20 of us walk to Broughton's kitchen garden where astronomer Chris Higgins is waiting with a powerful telescope.\nHiggins talks us through various constellations and planets, and we take it in turns to look at them through the telescope. I am awestruck by the sight of Venus, which appears like a crescent moon, as well Jupiter with its four moons and its light and dark bands.\nThe group bonds quickly \u2013 our natural reserve seems to disappear as we ooh and aah at the cosmos. It's a freezing night, but no one wants to go inside. It feels like a gift \u2013 this clear, beautiful night \u2013 and we can't stop staring at the sky. After a while, I let go of trying to understand the science and just gaze up, letting the cool light of the stars calm me. I love the idea that while almost everything on our planet has changed since the beginning of humanity, the beauty of the night sky has remained the same. I am staring up at the same view my ancestors marvelled at, and there is something deeply grounding about that.\nI am hooked. When I return home, I start searching for star-bathing retreats. At the top of my wish-list is luxury off-grid retreat centre Bliss & Stars, located two hours from the nearest village in South Africa's Cederberg Wilderness Area. Launched in 2019 by Daria and Heine Rasmussen, it offers three-night star-bathing retreats, featuring guided stargazing sessions, nature immersion, mindfulness, breathwork under the stars and night hikes.\u00a0\nDaria tells me that many visitors have profound experiences gazing at the night sky. \"One guest, numbed by years of trauma, experienced a breakthrough while observing Saturn's rings, describing it as 'awe as exorcism' that rebooted his capacity for joy,\" she says. \"Another guest, a grieving mother, found solace in our wilderness night ventures and naked-eye stargazing, saying: 'It felt like the universe was mourning with me.'\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The seven travel trends that will shape 2025\n\u2022\u00a0Five extraordinary night-time experiences around the world\n\u2022\u00a0Swede dreams: How Sweden is embracing its sleepy side\u00a0\u00a0\nAlso high on my bucket list is Chile's Atacama Desert, which features the world's darkest, clearest skies. Elqui Domos Hotel has been designed specifically for appreciating these pristine night skies \u2013 it features geodesic rooms with retractable roofs to allow guests to look straight up from their bed. Hotel Ranga in Iceland, meanwhile, features a state-of-the-art observatory, and offers the chance to take part in mindful stargazing from outdoor hot tubs fed by geothermally heated water.\nIn the Scottish Highlands, Cairngorm Excursions runs star-bathing parties, bringing people together for a night of stargazing far from any light pollution, with hot drinks, traditional stovies (a Scottish dish made from meat and potatoes), blankets and log seating. This being Scotland, the evenings also feature a gin, whisky and rum sampling experience put on by a local distillery.\nAboriginal Australians are thought to be the world's first astronomers, and a growing number of experiences offer visitors a chance to learn about Indigenous astronomy. Aboriginal-owned Ngurrangga Tours offers an overnight trip in Western Australia's Millstream Chichester National Park with an evening of camping, exploring the wilderness and learning about Indigenous star stories. In Sydney, Fantasea Cruising offers an Aboriginal Sky Dreaming Cruise on the harbour, with an Aboriginal astronomer sharing stories of the Sun, Moon and stars that have been passed down by ancestors.\u00a0\nFor now, I go out into my Bristol garden on clear nights and lie down on a blanket. The sky is nowhere near as dark as it was in Yorkshire, and light pollution obscures many of the stars, but I find that I can still slip into that now familiar sense of peace.\nPerhaps it doesn't matter how many stars I can see. As Westmoquette says: \"Even if you can only see one star \u2013 that light's been travelling across the universe for hundreds and hundreds of years to hit your eyeball at that precise moment. Against all the odds, you're seeing that ray of light. That means something.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "How has Thomas Tuchel changed things with England?\nChanging training times, more direct forms of communication and encouraging a swagger - Thomas Tuchel has already started doing things his way.\nThe Three Lions' new German boss guided England to routine victories over Albania and Latvia in World Cup qualifying as life after Gareth Southgate began successfully.\nBut what changes from the Southgate era have been implemented, and are now at the heart of shaping what Tuchel hopes is England's journey to World Cup glory?\nHere we explore some of these changes inside the England camp.\n'We will get there' - who were winners & losers for Tuchel's England?\n'England show Tuchel's search for thrills will be no quick fix'\nTraining has been moved to late afternoon in a key technical diversion from Southgate's regime.\nUnder Southgate, who was England manager for eight years, players would generally train after breakfast but Tuchel is scheduling his sessions for post-lunch, with training held towards late afternoon.\nThe hope is the change in approach will allow England's players and staff to have a longer period during the day to prepare for their sessions.\nLater training is a concept coaches have utilised with increasing regularity in recent years, with a view to improving performance amid a view that holding sessions closer to matchday kick-off times can benefit players during the actual 90 minutes.\nThere are also said to be benefits to training intensity linked to body temperature, oxygen consumption and sleep recovery with later sessions.\nCertain sessions ran into early evening, meaning training under portable floodlights.\nThis video can not be played\nIt's a good start - with room to improve - Tuchel\nTuchel has been maintaining communication with players outside of the international window.\nSouthgate also used to stay within earshot of his players, but by all accounts Tuchel's dedication to staying connected has gone above and beyond his predecessor.\nHe also kept in touch with players who ultimately didn't make his squad, to explain the reasons why and what was required moving forward for them to earn a recall.\nIt's the sort of transparency players have appreciated, although such honesty can often be difficult for certain footballers to hear.\nIt is understood Tuchel has even offered certain players career advice for the summer transfer window, as to whether a fresh start at a new club would benefit their international hopes.\nWhere Southgate, certainly towards the end of his reign, would break the news to new or unexpected call-ups on the day of a squad announcement, Tuchel confirmed with some players that they would be called up the evening before the big reveal.\nAll players who were on Tuchel's radar received a text in the days leading up to the squad announcement informing them that they could be called up.\nMost of the 26 players actually confirmed in Tuchel's squad all received messages at about 07:30 GMT, before the 09:00 announcement on 14 March.\nClubs would usually be told hours in advance if their players had been selected. This time, official communication to domestic teams didn't arrive, in some cases, until 20 minutes before the squad was confirmed.\nThe reasons for such secrecy remains unclear, though the approach does lend itself to preventing news leaking before the official announcement.\nPerhaps the most significant change for the players has been Tuchel's move to naming his starting XI on a matchday.\nSouthgate usually named his team the night before a fixture - while many players knew the XI based on the shape and personnel deployed in training.\nBut, for Friday's game against Albania, the players were informed of the team during a noon meeting on the day of the match.\nFor Monday's qualifier against Latvia, sources have indicated the players didn't know the full starting XI until about 16:00 - less than four hours before the game.\nCertain clues from training have also proved red herrings. For example, Morgan Rogers and Anthony Gordon featured heavily in shape training the day before the Albania game, causing many in camp to believe the pair would start the game.\nYet both started on the bench - though Rogers was named in the XI against Latvia.\nNot that the uncertainty over team selection appears to have hindered the players.\nSix points, five goals and two clean sheets represents an encouraging start for Tuchel.\nJordan Henderson and Dan Burn, two of Tuchel's most unexpected selections, were among the first through the door when the squad convened last Monday afternoon.\nThe players arrived to a flurry of broadcast activity, which has proved so popular with England's social media output.\nAt the club's Hilton hotel base at St George's Park, Tuchel has placed a keen emphasis on having various communal areas for his players to relax together.\nPlaying video games, of which Rice is said to be the squad standard-bearer, remains a popular pastime.\nSouthgate put a major emphasis on his players building a bond. Tuchel is determined to build on that existing camaraderie.\nIndeed, the England head coach stressed the importance of relationships in his first address to the team on Monday night.\nIn his opening speech, Tuchel reiterated they have just 24 training sessions together before USA 2026 gets under way.\nTo that end, the former Chelsea boss admitted he would not be making drastic changes to the playing style Southgate had developed.\nBased on the opening training sessions, it quickly became apparent that Tuchel would employ a four-man defence - despite conjecture the German would use a three-at-the-back system he relied on successfully at Chelsea.\nThe overriding message of Tuchel's address, though, was one of triumph and history.\n\"He said the goal was to put another star on the jersey,\" divulged Burn last week.\n\nThis video can not be played\nWhy you shouldn't want Tuchel's England peaking now\nWatch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer\nAn exciting start or lots of work needed? Reaction and your thoughts on England under Tuchel\nWho can be 'a real asset'? England player ratings v Latvia\nSome things never change. Moving forward Tuchel views Harry Kane, Declan Rice and John Stones as the core spine of his team.\nAll three players were made aware of their importance well in advance of the German's first squad selection.\nIt will take injury or something drastic for the trio not to be named in England's starting XI at next year's World Cup finals, which they are expected to comfortably reach.\nYou can add Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka to names of almost guaranteed starters.\nIn camp, Tuchel has held one-to-one meetings with certain players with a view to discovering what makes them tick, but also to understand more who the leaders in his team are.\nTuchel likes big personalities, bordering on arrogance. A swagger. He's spent the past 10 days trying to figure out who those personalities are.\nThe media activities before Friday's win over Albania caused a stir.\nFirstly, a video clip of Reece James explaining why Tuchel was the best manager he'd worked with disappeared from ITV's social media just hours after it went live. \nIt was explained to BBC Sport that the video was removed because of embargo complications.\nThen came Tuchel's frank interview with ITV in which he said England lacked a clear identity under Southgate at Euro 2024, and that they were \"afraid\" to win the tournament.\nThe remarks were met with a mixed reaction, causing consternation among some within football amid a sense they are ill-informed and disrespectful to Southgate, particularly given England reached the final of the tournament.\nOthers have applauded Tuchel for his honesty.

        "summary": "'We will get there' - who were winners & losers for Tuchel's England?Published1 day ago'England show Tuchel's search for thrills will be no quick fix'Published1 day agoTraining switched to afternoonTraining has been moved to late afternoon in a key technical diversion from Southgate's regime.Under Southgate, who was England manager for eight years, players would generally train after breakfast but Tuchel is scheduling his sessions for post-lunch, with training held towards late afternoon.The hope is the change in approach will allow England's players and staff to have a longer period during the day to prepare for their sessions.Later training is a concept coaches have utilised with increasing regularity in recent years, with a view to improving performance amid a view that holding sessions closer to matchday kick-off times can benefit players during the actual 90 minutes.There are also said to be benefits to training intensity linked to body temperature, oxygen consumption and sleep recovery with later sessions.Certain sessions ran into early evening, meaning training under portable floodlights.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, It's a good start - with room to improve - TuchelTuchel dedicated to keeping in touchTuchel has been maintaining communication with players outside of the international window.Southgate also used to stay within earshot of his players, but by all accounts Tuchel's dedication to staying connected has gone above and beyond his predecessor.He also kept in touch with players who ultimately didn't make his squad, to explain the reasons why and what was required moving forward for them to earn a recall.It's the sort of transparency players have appreciated, although such honesty can often be difficult for certain footballers to hear.It is understood Tuchel has even offered certain players career advice for the summer transfer window, as to whether a fresh start at a new club would benefit their international hopes.Late squad and team announcementsWhere Southgate, certainly towards the end of his reign, would break the news to new or unexpected call-ups on the day of a squad announcement, Tuchel confirmed with some players that they would be called up the evening before the big reveal.All players who were on Tuchel's radar received a text in the days leading up to the squad announcement informing them that they could be called up.Most of the 26 players actually confirmed in Tuchel's squad all received messages at about 07:30 GMT, before the 09:00 announcement on 14 March.Clubs would usually be told hours in advance if their players had been selected. 'Tuchel wants swagger' - what has changed under new England bossImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, How has Thomas Tuchel changed things with England?Sami MokbelSenior football correspondentPublished25 March 2025537 CommentsChanging training times, more direct forms of communication and encouraging a swagger - Thomas Tuchel has already started doing things his way.The Three Lions' new German boss guided England to routine victories over Albania and Latvia in World Cup qualifying as life after Gareth Southgate began successfully.But what changes from the Southgate era have been implemented, and are now at the heart of shaping what Tuchel hopes is England's journey to World Cup glory?Here we explore some of these changes inside the England camp. For example, Morgan Rogers and Anthony Gordon featured heavily in shape training the day before the Albania game, causing many in camp to believe the pair would start the game.Yet both started on the bench - though Rogers was named in the XI against Latvia.Not that the uncertainty over team selection appears to have hindered the players.Six points, five goals and two clean sheets represents an encouraging start for Tuchel.An opening speech on 'triumph and history'Jordan Henderson and Dan Burn, two of Tuchel's most unexpected selections, were among the first through the door when the squad convened last Monday afternoon.The players arrived to a flurry of broadcast activity, which has proved so popular with England's social media output.At the club's Hilton hotel base at St George's Park, Tuchel has placed a keen emphasis on having various communal areas for his players to relax together.Playing video games, of which Rice is said to be the squad standard-bearer, remains a popular pastime.Southgate put a major emphasis on his players building a bond. This time, official communication to domestic teams didn't arrive, in some cases, until 20 minutes before the squad was confirmed.The reasons for such secrecy remains unclear, though the approach does lend itself to preventing news leaking before the official announcement.Perhaps the most significant change for the players has been Tuchel's move to naming his starting XI on a matchday.Southgate usually named his team the night before a fixture - while many players knew the XI based on the shape and personnel deployed in training.But, for Friday's game against Albania, the players were informed of the team during a noon meeting on the day of the match.For Monday's qualifier against Latvia, sources have indicated the players didn't know the full starting XI until about 16:00 - less than four hours before the game.Certain clues from training have also proved red herrings. Moving forward Tuchel views Harry Kane, Declan Rice and John Stones as the core spine of his team.All three players were made aware of their importance well in advance of the German's first squad selection.It will take injury or something drastic for the trio not to be named in England's starting XI at next year's World Cup finals, which they are expected to comfortably reach.You can add Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka to names of almost guaranteed starters.In camp, Tuchel has held one-to-one meetings with certain players with a view to discovering what makes them tick, but also to understand more who the leaders in his team are.Tuchel likes big personalities, bordering on arrogance.",

        "article_text": "For the past 48 hours, top White House officials have faced questions from lawmakers and the press about how a journalist came to join a sensitive group chat for an upcoming military operation - and why President Donald Trump's national security team was sharing sensitive information in an unsecure manner.\nThe Atlantic first reported details of the group chat on the platform Signal after its editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to it. He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\nA National Security Council spokesman later confirmed that the portions of the chat that Mr Goldberg initially shared \"appears to be authentic\".\nThe Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March strike on Yemen after Mr Goldberg and the publication faced pushback from the Trump administration. \nWhile the thread appears to have contained sensitive information, there is still much that remains unknown. Here are six lingering questions regarding so-called \"Signal-gate\".\nThe Trump administration maintains the information shared in the chat was not classified.\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that the Signal chat was \"candid and sensitive\" but \"no classified information was shared\".\nBut under questioning, she and CIA Director John Ratcliffe appeared uncertain about the classification of the attack plan. They later emphasised that Hegseth had the power to classify and declassify the type of details that were shared. \nHegseth has denied sharing classified material, but experts are sceptical that this type of sensitive information would not carry that kind of designation.\n\"The idea this wasn't classified information at the time is inconceivable,\" Glenn Gerstell, former general counsel of the National Security Agency, told the BBC. \"I don't know if they declassified it afterwards but any imminent military action involving American troops would have been classified at the time.\"\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that \"no war plans\" were discussed on the chat. Instead, she characterised the information shared as  \"sensitive policy discussions\".\nJamil Jaffer, executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University, said that Hegseth did not send \"an operational plan for World War Three, or for the Pacific region\".\n\"But at the same time,\" Mr Jaffer said, \"these are operational details that could, if released publicly, put American lives at risk or jeopardise the success of the operation.\"\nIn his original article, Mr Goldberg reports that on 11 March he initially \"received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz\", Trump's national security adviser.\nTwo days later, he writes that he received a notice that he was to be included in a Signal group titled the \"Houthi PC small group.\"\nMr Goldberg reports that the group received a message from Waltz, which also noted one of his deputies was \"pulling together\" a team of top staffers relevant to the discussion. \nOn Tuesday, Trump suggested that a \"lower level\" staffer for Waltz added Mr Goldberg to the chat.\nHowever, Waltz himself told Fox News' Laura Ingraham: \"I take full responsibility. I built the - I built the group.\"\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in the group, said on Wednesday that someone had made a \"mistake\" in adding Mr Goldberg.\nIt remains to be seen whether Congress will launch oversight investigations, which it has the power to pursue.\nTrump is a Republican, and both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate - are controlled by his party.\nThat means committees who have oversight of the executive branch, military, and intelligence community are run by Republicans.\nRepublican lawmakers have emphatically supported the Trump administration's agenda to this point, so it seems improbable that they would support investigations into the Signal chat.\nDemocrats in the House are reportedly trying to force a vote on a \"Resolution of Inquiry\" that would require the Trump administration to hand over records related to the incident, according to Reuters, but they do not have a majority. \nWhile some Republicans have raised concerns over the leak, few have appeared eager to cross the president. \nDemocratic lawmakers are calling for resignations, but at the moment, none of the officials involved in the Signal chat have stepped down.\nHegseth and Waltz have faced the most calls to resign, and some cabinet officials have said that their process will go under review. \n\"I think there'll be reforms and changes made,\" Rubio told reporters on Wednesday.\nStill, it is unclear if the president will ask any members of his team to step down. So far, the White House has launched a full-court defence of the Signal chat and the officials who participated.\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that Waltz \"took responsibility\", but has previously maintained that he has not lost confidence in his national security adviser.\nHegseth also appears safe from Trump's ire for now.\n\"Hegseth is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this,\" the president said. \nThe use of Signal to discuss the Houthi strikes posed broader questions about how Trump's top staffers are sharing and discussing sensitive information.\nGabbard testified on Wednesday that Signal came \"pre-installed on government devices\".\nShe cited guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which mentioned Signal as an example of a messaging service with end-to-end encryption.\nRatcliffe earlier testified to Congress that Signal had been installed on his devices when he took over the CIA.\nBut it remains uncertain if security officials had provided guidance about using Signal for discussing military operations like the strikes against the Houthis.\n\"Whether these circumstances were approved or not is still not clear,\" Mr Jaffer said.\nCBS News, the BBC's US partner, has reported, however, that the US National Security Agency had warned employees against using Signal due to \"a vulnerability\" that they had identified.\n\"The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" warned the NSA bulletin that was shared a month before the Houthi Strike chat. \nThe group chat appears to suggest that the officials' discussion was one that had continued from the White House Situation Room, one of the most secure venues in the US government. \nThis is unusual. Oftentimes further discussion or the inclusion of team members who cannot attend in person is done via secure rooms called sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIFs. \nTop-ranking national security officials have these SCIFs installed in their offices and homes to ensure the protection of sensitive information and discussions. \nThat can add a layer of complexity to planning and coordination, however, which may have led to lax security system standards. \n\"Whatever they have might not be effective enough,\" Mr Jaffer said. \"Or there's so many restrictions on it, that it forces senior officials into workarounds that themselves might create vulnerabilities.\"",

        "article_text": "The detention of South Sudan's First Vice-President Riek Machar has effectively collapsed the 2018 peace deal that ended the country's five-year civil war, his party has said. \nAn armed convoy led by top security officials, including the defence minister, entered Machar's residence in the capital, Juba, and disarmed his bodyguards late on Wednesday, said the Sudan People's Liberation Movement In Opposition (SPLM/IO). \nMachar was detained alongside his wife Angelina Teny, who is also the country's interior minister, the party added. \nThe US has urged the authorities to free Machar, while the UN, African Union and neighbouring countries have all expressed their concern.\n\nThe UN Mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, warned that the world's newest nation risked losing the \"hard-won gains of the past seven years\" if it returned to \"a state of war\". \n\"Tonight, the country's leaders stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict,\" the mission said in a statement on Wednesday. \nThe government is yet to comment on Machar's reported house-arrest.\nBut addressing religious leaders on Wednesday, President Salva Kiir said \"he will never return the country to war\". \nTensions have been building between Machar and the president for several weeks. \nThe two leaders agreed in August 2018 to end the civil war between their forces that killed nearly 400,000 people. But over the last seven years their relationship has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.\nEarlier this week, the UN said that barrel bombs believed to contain a highly flammable liquid had been used in airstrikes during fighting between the army and a rebel group previously linked to Machar.\n\"The arrest and detention of H.E. Dr Riek Machar effectively brings the [peace] agreement to a collapse,\" SPLM/IO deputy leader Oyet Nathaniel Pierino told journalists on Thursday.\n\"The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,\" he added.\nA similar warning was issued by the UN mission in the country, which said the country's leaders \"stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict\". \nThe situation has been exacerbated by the deployment of Ugandan troops and their battle tanks into South Sudan, following a request by the country's president, according to the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan chair Yasmin Sooka.\nShe says this raises serious concerns over potential violations of the UN arms embargo and the growing partisan role of foreign forces, which further endangers civilians and risks regional escalation.\nTension remains high in Juba with a heavy military presence reported around Machar's home.\n\"The public are in a panic,\" civil society leader Edmund Yakani told the AFP news agency.\n\"There is a high chance of full-scale war but it will be more deadly and more violent because of [the need] for revenge,\" he added.\nPierino called on SPLM/IO members and the public to remain calm as diplomatic efforts continue to resolve the situation.\nThe BBC understands that the African Union and the regional body, Igad, are expected to send high-level delegations to Juba on Friday, to help curb the escalating crisis.\nReath Muoch Tang, chairman of the party's foreign relations committee, said Machar was under house-arrest, but that security officials initially tried to take him away.\n\"An arrest warrant was delivered to him under unclear charges,\" Tang said in a statement, calling the action a \"blatant violation of the constitution and the Revitalized Peace Agreement\".\nThe UN mission warned that violations of the 2018 peace deal \"will not only devastate South Sudan but also affect the entire region\". \nThe British and US embassies have scaled down their diplomatic staff and urged their citizens to leave the country while the Norwegian and German embassies have closed their operations in Juba. \nThe US has called on President Kiir to free his rival from the reported house-arrest, urging the two leaders to show commitment to peace.\n\"We urge President Kiir to reverse this action & prevent further escalation of the situation,\" the US Bureau of African Affairs wrote on X. \nThe escalating tensions come amid renewed clashes between forces loyal to the two rivals in the northern town of Nasir in the oil-rich Upper Nile State.\nAdditional reporting by Nichola Mandil in Juba\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

But fewer are aware of the Windscale fire.\nIt was one of the world's first - and remains the UK's worst - nuclear accident.\nA nuclear reactor at the site in Cumbria caught fire on 10 October 1957 and burned for three days, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere.\nMany details of the event were kept quiet for decades, and it is far less famous than some of the more recent examples.\nBut a new video game has brought the disaster, and the area where it happened, back into the spotlight.\nAtomfall is the latest release from Oxford-based Rebellion, best known for its long-running Sniper Elite series.\nCEO Jason Kingsley tells BBC Newsbeat he was walking in the Lake District when the idea of using the real-life Windscale story \"as a trigger point for a fictionalised version of the disaster\" began to take shape.\nAtomfall is a survival action game set in the rolling green landscapes of the beauty spot, but on an alternative sci-fi inspired timeline where the area surrounding the plant has become a quarantine zone.\n\"It went pretty wrong in real life, but it was controlled,\" says Jason. \n\"It was a proper disaster, but it didn't cause strange glowing plants or mutants or dangerous cults to emerge.\"\nAlthough the Windscale fire was \"very serious\", Jason says it's not something that is especially well-remembered, even among locals.\nIt was previously estimated about 240 cases of thyroid cancer were caused by the radioactive leak, but more recent research has suggested this was unlikely.\nScientists suggested a decision to destroy all milk produced within 310 square miles (800 square km) of the site for a month after the fire helped to prevent exposure.\nWindscale was eventually renamed Sellafield and produced nuclear power until 2003. It still employs about 10,000 people in the local area.\nWhen Newsbeat visits Cumbria, most young people we speak to say they haven't heard of the disaster.\nAnd indie game developers Hannah Roberts and Harry Howson say that they became more aware of it once the game was announced.\nFor two people like them, who hope to break into the games industry, they're excited to see a game set in the place where they live.\nHannah, 26, says it's evident Atomfall's makers have done their research. \n\"The actual environments are spot on, they've got fantastic Morris dancing stuff going on - it really tickled me when I saw that,\" she says. \nHannah says other small details - like black and white Cumbrian signposts - were also pleasing to see.\nAtomfall's setting and its inspiration have made it an anticipated title since it was first revealed last year, and Harry, 23, says that's been encouraging for him. \n\"Seeing that such a small space like Cumbria can be taken by the games industry and built upon and people are receptive to that, it's exciting for the future and I look forward to seeing what's next for me,\" he says.\nIt's fairly unusual for high-profile games set in the UK to be set outside London. \nWhile indie games - such as the Shropshire-set Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and last year's Barnsley-based laughfest Thank Goodness You're Here! - have ventured further north, bigger games haven't tended to stray beyond the M25.\nJason says the US is about 40% of the video games market, so it's important to appeal to players there, and there's a \"natural tendency\" to follow the norms.\nBeing an independent company, he feels, allows Rebellion to do things differently, and Britain offers lots of inspiration for new settings - if you're prepared to look for them.\n\"The UK, I think, to understand certain aspects of our culture, you've got to dig into it a little bit because we tend to understate things quite a lot.\"\nRebellion's Head of Design Ben Fisher says the goal was to create a \"slightly theme parkish\" version of the Lake District with accurate details.\n\"There are things that, as locals, it's easy for us to forget are unique to Britain, that are unusual,\" he says.\nThe team that worked on the game has members from various countries, Ben says, which helped to highlight things the UK natives might have missed.\n\"The lead artist on the project is from Seattle and was mystified by dry stone walls,\"  says Ben.\nHe adds the team spent time recreating the structures - which are constructed without the use of mortar - to \"capture those local details\".\nFeaturing a local area in a film or TV show can expose a new audience to that place.\n\"Ultimately, what's incredibly rewarding about this industry is you can put your ideas down and they can be played by people across the globe,\" Jason says.\n\"And you know, how wonderful is it to sort of talk about the Lake District to people that live in Africa or Southeast Asia or Canada or wherever it might be. \n\"That's a kind of form of soft power that very few types of media have.\"\nOliver Hodgson, 21, can see Sellafield from his bedroom window.\nHe hopes that the local area will benefit from some of the soft power Jason describes.\n\"I think it's just an incredibly powerful thing for young people in west Cumbria,\" he says. \n\"I think it's really positive to see such a big gaming developer set a story in Cumbria, which is normally just known for its lakes and mountains,\" he says.\nOliver who runs his own PR firm, is working with the creators of a project to create a \u00a34m gaming hub in Whitehaven aimed at boosting digital skills in the area.\nOliver says he's glad the game has taken its inspiration from Windscale and is drawing attention to the area, as well as switching locals on to their history.\n\"I think we should own it,\u201d he says. \n\u201cThe story of the Windscale disaster obviously isn't a positive one but we can't rewrite history. \n\"So acknowledging what happened and teaching and letting young people learn about that history, if this is what brings it into the classroom or on to young people's phones or their social media, then so be it.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

I am sorry, it's my decision, and I accept that decision,\" said Crisafulli.\nThe government had toyed with plans to redevelop the Gabba - which was built in 1895 and has staged 67 men's Test matches - but those plans were scrapped following a 100-day review into planning for 2032.\nCricket, which is being held in Los Angeles in 2028 and is likely to be retained in 2032, could be played at the Gabba before the arena is torn down. \n\"Wouldn't it be amazing to see the Australian cricket team win gold at an Olympic final? The Gabba's swansong,\" Crisafulli said. \n\"The Gabba is at its end of life. It hasn't been well maintained, and we do need a stadium to host this great show, and there is an opportunity for legacy play.\"\nQueensland Cricket backed the plans, with chief executive Terry Svenson saying the arena had been a \"wonderful venue\" but its challenges were \"well documented\". \nA new 25,000-seater national aquatic centre will be built in Spring Hill near the main stadium, while a new 20,000-seater arena is planned near the main athletes village. \nThe rowing will be held in Queensland's Fitzroy River, which is known to host saltwater crocodiles but the government says the waters are safe.\n\"If it's good enough for central Queensland kids, I reckon it's good enough for Pierre from Paris,\" said Crisafulli. \nThe Brisbane Queensland Tennis Centre will receive significant upgrades in order to host tennis events. \nThe Gabba first staged a Test match in 1931 \nSpeaking to BBC World Service, ABC reporter Arianna Levy said the plans to build a stadium in Victoria Park are controversial because the site holds \"cultural significance\" to Aboriginal people. \n\"It really has come as a political backflip,\" said Levy on Tuesday.\n\"It's been really polarising for a lot of the community here in Queensland.\n\"The main stadium in Victoria Park, which will host 63,000 seats, it's one of the few green sites across Brisbane and it holds cultural significance to the Indigenous people of Brisbane, the Turrbal people. They call the place the Barrambin. \n\"It was a native camping ground and food-gathering place. It had First Nations people from across Queensland gather all over the place for corroboree, which is the traditional dance for First Nations people. \n\"There were protests today. There were communities that were against the development of the park to turn it into a stadium. We do imagine in the days to come there will be fallout from community groups and stakeholders that feel like this plan is not the best plan going forward.\"",

The species, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, was unique within a group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which stood on their hind legs and usually had three claws.It was medium-sized, with an estimated weight of approximately 260kg.Researchers believe the species' long, curved claws and its ability to strongly flex them would have made it an efficient grasper of vegetation.Yoshi Kobayashi, Hokkaido UniversityResearchers believe the dinosaur weighed approximately 260kgTherizinosaurs were a group of either herbivorous or omnivorous theropod dinosaurs that lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous Period, which began 145 million years ago and ended 66 million years ago.They are exemplified by the massive, long-clawed form Therizinosaurus, featured in the film Jurassic World Dominion, and were \"awkward looking\", according to one of the study's authors Dr Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor at the University of Calgary.The specimen was recovered from the Bayanshiree formation in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, which dates back to the Late Cretaceous period (between 100.5 to 66 million years ago).Unesco, the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, calls the Mongolian Gobi Desert the largest dinosaur fossil reservoir in the world. The region is an especially important source of fossils from the later Cretaceous period, which is the last of the main three periods of the dinosaur age, representing the final phase of dinosaur evolution.Kobayashi et alThe claws may also have been used as formidable weaponsAt nearly a foot long, the claws themselves were much larger than their underlying bone, the study revealed.Besides better grasping, the two-fingered hands may have been used for display, digging, or as formidable weapons.The most famous two-fingered theropods are species within the group tyrannosaurids, which includes Tyrannosaurus rex, but Duonychus evolved its two-fingered hands separately from them and from other two-fingered theropods. The specimen also preserves the first keratinous sheath of a therizinosaur, an element that covers the claw much like human fingernails, aiding defence, movement, or prey catching.FossilsPalaeontologyDinosaursScience & Environment",

She was playing so well, she was pretty dominant in her performance, especially in and around breakdown stuff. \n\"So it was unfortunate to lose her for a week, but Jade does have that experience that we can call on. So it's fairly smooth transition in the back row.

We've got to take confidence from our performance against Wales as well and go in with belief. \n\"We've won 13 out of the past 17 and that's how we've got to look at it.

By one man. With a particular interest in stamps.\nDr Borthwick explains that \"panic\" first set in when a National Records of Scotland (NRS) employee attended an auction in London in 1994.\nThey discovered that 200 of the items up for sale belonged to NRS.\nThese should have been safely in Scotland's archives, not being offloaded to the highest bidder via a bang of the auctioneer's gavel.\nNRS can date back all their archive users to 1847. After some cross referencing, Dr Borthwick and his team realised that the auction items all linked back to one person \u2013 Prof David Stirling Macmillan.\nProf Macmillan was born in 1925 and was from Girvan, Ayrshire. He served in the Royal Navy during World War Two and studied history at the University of Glasgow.\nHis right to use the national archives had been revoked in 1980 when he was caught removing a document. Staff assumed this was a one-off.\nBut the truth was that Prof Macmillan had been helping himself since 1949.\nThe 200 items that turned up in the London auction were the tip of the iceberg.\nNow National Records of Scotland are revealing the scale of his thefts. And the odd nature of them.\nProf Macmillan wasn't pinching documents that were worth a lot of money, or even those that were particularly historically significant.\nThe archives include letters from Robert Burns and Mary Queen of Scots. But these weren't his targets.\nThe contents of many of the letters he took are mundane, perhaps even boring.\nBut a lifelong interest in stamps and postmarks seem to have led to him taking letters that caught his eye. Including documents dating back to 1637.\nOne example was a letter from a Scot who'd moved to the island of Madeira, off the north west coast of Africa. In 1813 they wrote to a friend with some news and gossip. Not exactly explosive stuff.\nAnd yet Prof Macmillan ripped it out of the book it was stored in and pocketed it.\nWe can't be certain about the motivations involved, but the interesting postmark and wax seal on the document are thought to be what tempted the professor.\nThe thief went to great lengths to cover his tracks.\nHe would remove reference numbers from documents and sometimes replace what he had taken with forgeries.\nIronically, Prof Macmillan was himself a professional archivist. He held that role at the University of Sydney and even placed an appeal for historical papers in the university newspaper.\nThe man who spent years stealing documents stressed they would be \"properly looked after\" and bemoaned the fact that so much of history had been \"destroyed or lost\".\nThe academic moved to Trent University in Canada in 1968 and spent 20 years teaching history, though he still seems to have made annual visits to Scotland's archives. He died in 1987, leaving no immediate family.\nMuch of his collection then found its way into the archives of Trent University, where they remained for some time. They were catalogued and descriptions were put online.\nIn 2012. Dr Alan Borthwick was still trying to track down what had been taken. He realised that thousands of the Trent University items rightly belonged to NRS and other UK institutions.\nDr Borthwick was dispatched to North America to investigate.\nHe says he was amazed by the \"sheer quantity of documents\" he found that had been stolen by Prof Macmillan.\nThe chief executive of NRS, Alison Byrne, echoes this. She described the scale of Prof Macmillan's thefts as \"unprecedented\".\nShe only took up her role six months ago, and was appalled when she was filled in on the situation.\nSecuring the return of these documents was one thing. But finding their rightful home was arguably the bigger task.\nFor decades, Dr Borthwick and his team have been \"piecing together the jigsaw\", undertaking the painstaking process of finding the correct place for all of these stolen items.\nFor context, National Records of Scotland are the custodians of 38 million documents. \nThey have 50 miles (80km) of shelving \u2013 enough to stretch from Edinburgh to Glasgow.\nTheir archives are all about precision \u2013 every document has an exact home that makes locating it straightforward.\nThe team wanted to get each item that Prof Macmillan had taken brought back to its rightful place.\nFortunately, NRS \"daybooks\" show what he was signing out of the archives. But his attempts to cover his tracks and remove identifying marks complicated the challenge.\nNow National Records of Scotland say they have got almost everything back where it should be, ready to be pored over by a new generation of historians.\nBut, for Dr Borthwick, how does it feel to know that a fellow archivist so egregiously abused the trust that was put in him?\nThe historian labels it \"a kick in the teeth\". He's been trying to undo the damage done by Prof Macmillan for almost all of his working life.\nThat time could have been spent on other historical projects.\nBut Dr Borthwick reflects that there's a \"sense of satisfaction\" in solving the mystery of the missing documents.\nDocuments that, these days, are kept under the watchful eye of CCTV.",

        "article_text": "\"Horrific to see in black and white. But hardly surprising,\" is how a top European diplomat reacted to what comes across as deep, heartfelt disdain for European allies, revealed late on Monday, European time, in an online group chat between top US security officials.\nSeemingly by accident, Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was also invited to the chat, which discussed planned strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen aimed at unblocking trade routes on the Suez Canal. He subsequently made the frank exchange public.\nIn the chat, Vice-President JD Vance notes that only 3% of US trade runs through the canal, as opposed to 40% of European trade, after which he and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth complain of European \"free-loading\".\nThe monumental security breach is causing a ruckus at home, with Democrats calling for Hegseth's resignation as a result.\nAcross the pond - aka the Atlantic - Europe's leaders and policy-makers felt \"sick to their stomach\", as an EU official put it to me.\nOfficials quoted here are speaking on condition of anonymity in order to comment freely on what are volatile times in US-European relations. You won't see comments in the public domain, so as not to rock the transatlantic boat any further.\nVance first stunned European officials with his speech at last month's Security Conference in Munich condemning the continent for having misplaced values such as protecting abortion clinics and censoring speech in the media and online. \"The enemy from within,\" he called it.\nMonday's Signal chat strikes at the heart of a slew of tensions, discomfort and plain old fear in Europe right now, that the Trump administration can no longer be relied on as the continent's greatest ally. At a time when Europe is facing off against a resurgent Russia.\nWestern Europe has looked to the US to have its back in terms of security and defence since World War Two.\nBut it is precisely that fact that so riles the Trump administration and has cemented Europe in its mind as \"freeloaders\".\nWhile the US commits 3.7% of its colossal GDP to defence, it's taken the majority of European partners in the transatlantic defence alliance Nato until recently to cough up even 2% of GDP. Some, like big economies Spain and Italy, aren't even there yet, though they say they plan to be soon.\nEurope relies heavily on the US, amongst other things, for intelligence, for aerial defence capabilities and for its nuclear umbrella.\nWith the phasing out of conscription in most European countries, the continent also relies on the around 100,000 battle-ready US troops stationed in Europe to help act as a deterrent against potential aggressors.\nEuropeans have focused more on investing in welfare and social services than defence - collective or otherwise - since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Why on earth should the US pick up the slack, asks the Trump administration.\nOn the leaked group chat, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz laments the state of Europe's naval forces. \"It will have to be the United States that reopens these [Suez] shipping lanes.\"\nThe chat then debates how to ensure that Europe remunerates the US for its actions.\n\"If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return,\" states a message from someone called SM - presumed to be deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller.\nEurope is now loudly and publicly discussing spending a lot more on its own defence - hoping to keep Donald Trump onside and an aggressive Russia at bay after Ukraine.\nBut Trump's irritation with Europe is nothing new.\nHe displayed his displeasure during his first term in office: furious about Europe's low defence spending; incandescent over the EU's trade surplus with the US.\nThe United States had been long been taken for a ride and that must stop, seemed to be his sentiment.\nImposing trade tariffs was one of Trump's first responses. Then as now.\nEarlier this month, when Trump threatened eye-watering 200% tariffs on European alcohol in an ongoing trade tit-for-tat, he lambasted the EU as \"abusive\" and \"hostile\" for allegedly taking advantage of the US at any opportunity.\nCoinciding uncomfortably with the leaked Signal chat and its Euro-bashing, the EU's trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, along with the head of cabinet of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Washington on Tuesday hoping to launch a charm offensive to try to stave off a new tariff onslaught.\nOn defence, Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened that the US wouldn't protect countries that \"didn't pay\".\nHis candidate to be the next US ambassador to Nato says that means Europeans spending 5% of GDP.\nThe UK currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defence, aiming for 2.6% by 2027. France scrapes 2.1% of GDP on military spending annually.\nDuring the Cold War, the common enemy was the Soviet Union, which included swathes of Eastern Europe.\nThe US wanted to keep western Europe close, and for it to stay militarily dependent.\nSince then, there has been growing apathy towards Nato and Europe. Particularly after the 9/11 twin tower attacks in the US.\nAttention in Washington turned to Iraq and Afghanistan. To China.\nPresident Obama was clear he wanted Asia to be his top foreign policy priority.\nTrump is far from the first US president to harrumph at Europe's reluctance to do more for, as well as spend more on, its own defence.\nBut with Trump, there is also a deep ideological split.\nOn social values, as JD Vance alluded to in Munich.\nBut also - and this is key - Trump demonstrates not only an antipathy for Europe and an impatience to get the war in Ukraine \"done and over\", he also displays an affinity for Russia's Vladimir Putin, at a time when Europe considers him an immediate threat to the security and well-being of the whole continent.",

Then as now.Earlier this month, when Trump threatened eye-watering 200% tariffs on European alcohol in an ongoing trade tit-for-tat, he lambasted the EU as \"abusive\" and \"hostile\" for allegedly taking advantage of the US at any opportunity.EPAVon der Leyen and Sefcovic are in Washington to try to stave off tariffsCoinciding uncomfortably with the leaked Signal chat and its Euro-bashing, the EU's trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, along with the head of cabinet of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, arrived in Washington on Tuesday hoping to launch a charm offensive to try to stave off a new tariff onslaught.On defence, Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened that the US wouldn't protect countries that \"didn't pay\".His candidate to be the next US ambassador to Nato says that means Europeans spending 5% of GDP.The UK currently spends 2.3% of GDP on defence, aiming for 2.6% by 2027.",

        "article_text": "The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.\nBut there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.\n\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Phillip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.\nIn exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.\nWe're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.\nWater and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.\nPhillip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.\nMore importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.\nSo cheap it made business sense for Phillip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.\nEach machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.\nOccasionally Phillip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.\nAt the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Phillip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.\n\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.\nZengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.\nIt was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.\nBritish-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.\nNow it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.\nAllowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.\n\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.\nThe bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.\nBitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.\nThe town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.\nOnly one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.\nAlthough the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses. \nSo, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.\n\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"\nHe's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.\n\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"\nEmbracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.\nElsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.\nLike many young people, they're glued to their phones.\n\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.\nThe little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.\n\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.\n\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.\n\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"\nNot many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.\nBut soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.\nZengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.\nSoon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.\nPhillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.\nThe company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.\nGridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.\nNorth of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.\nBut Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.\nThe company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.\nThey're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.\n\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.\nThe company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.\nFinding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.\nThe company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.\nBut the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.\nHistory tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.\n\nIn the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.\nAuthorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.\nFor example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.\nAgreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.\nThe environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.\nBut according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.\nSet ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.\nBut they are also a rare example of a controversial industry creating much more than just digital coins.",

        "article_text": "Billy Horschel made a birdie putt on the penultimate hole as Atlanta Drive GC beat New York GC to claim the inaugural TGL title in Florida\nAs Billy Horschel's golf ball disappeared into the hole, the American celebrated by sprinting, leaping, swearing and chucking his club. \nIt was an electrifying and animated move that became the signature moment of TGL's debut season.\nThat downhill, snaking and ultimately successful putt helped land Horschel and his Atlanta Drive team-mates Patrick Cantlay and Justin Thomas victory against the franchise known as New York Golf Club.\nThis was in the second of the best of three final series. The victors came from 3-0 down (a point is awarded for each hole won) to triumph 4-3 to take an unassailable 2-0 position.\nSuch a dramatic finish was exactly what the Tech-infused Golf League needed - the sort of climax envisaged by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy when they bought into the idea of a raucous indoor simulator version of the game.\nThe decisive putt, which involved a number of dramatic breaks, could be seen as a metaphor for an opening season that was far from straightforward.\nThere were technical glitches, blowout matches, necessary rule changes and a mixture of reactions from golf fans. But somehow the TGL eventually hit its target.\nIt yielded respectable television audiences, helped reveal players' personalities and engaged a somewhat younger audience. The median age for ESPN's viewership was 51 years old compared with the usual 63 for PGA Tour and LIV events.\nAtlanta Drive fight back to win inaugural TGL title\nAtlanta beat New York in opening match of TGL Final\nPlayed largely on Monday and Tuesday evenings, this was all about attracting viewers. It began promisingly with more than 900,000 in the US tuning in for the initial match in January, but audiences tapered off to eventually average around the half-million mark.\nThe early contests lacked a competitive edge. The players seemed to struggle with the concept - there was an awkwardness between a competition worth $21m in prize money and an environment that made it seem a hit-and-giggle event.\nIn one match Woods misunderstood a distance instruction by 100 yards and laughed it off. Imagine that in a tour event. It wouldn't happen. TGL's competitive credibility undoubtedly took a hit with that moment.\nThe tactic of playing the 'hammer' to make a hole worth double points did not work initially but became a more effective tool once the rules were adjusted to allow for three 'hammers'.\nThis dimension ultimately became a crucial factor in deciding the title and brought a welcome edge to proceedings.\nTGL created the sort of buzz that has been the target of the breakaway LIV tour.  The Saudi-based circuit, now in its fourth season, has only enjoyed limited success in that regard - most notably with their Adelaide tournament.\nHorschel's histrionics were straight out of the LIV playbook but did not seem out of place once TGL reached its play-off stage. The unalterably dead-pan Cantlay was a constant reminder that there was underlying serious business afoot.\nIt was Cantlay's chip against Cameron Young one hole after Horschel's dramatic putt that sealed Atlanta Drive's victory.\n\"It would be great for golf if this were to succeed,\" LIV's Phil Mickelson observed on social media. \n\"The golf fan is the most loyal fan in sports - buy a ticket, walk miles and see a fraction of the action. But this could allow the golf fan to buy a ticket, sit down and watch all of the action just like other sports. \n\"It could really be good for the game if it's compelling.\"\nLIV players are not currently eligible for TGL because it is backed by the PGA Tour.  That could change if a deal is done between the two rival tours and LIV's Brooks Koepka attended the match between Jupiter and The Bay on 25 February.\nThe start of the first of the two deciding matches on Monday was delayed by an overrunning Women's NCAA basketball game on ESPN2, which tells us of TGL's standing in the bigger sporting picture.\nNevertheless, it will return. Investment is deep for a project that boasts 11 of the world's top 15 golfers. The 1500 seat 250,000 square feet Sofi Centre venue on the Palm Beach State College campus cost $50m to build.\nAnd there are already thoughts of adding a second venue on America's west coast, although that would likely be years down the line.\n\"We're in the middle of an expansion process now,\" said Mike McCarley, the TMRW executive who co-founded the project with Woods and McIlroy.\n\"When exactly we make that decision - there's no timeline on it necessarily,\" McCarley added to the Palm Beach Post.\n\"We've had potential expansion team owners at every single match this season coming to visit us. Some of them, multiple times. Some of them have a lot of questions, a lot of feedback.\"\nTGL already has the backing of leading American sports investors, who are behind the six teams that competed.\nThey include the Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank (Atlanta Drive), John Henry and the Fenway Sports Group (Boston Common), New York Mets owner Steve Cohen (New York Golf Club), former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry (The Bay Golf Club) and David Blitzer, who joined Woods' group that owns Jupiter Links.\n\"We really like those team owners that are operators of other sports teams and other professional leagues in their communities,\" McCarley said.\n\"But we got a lot of really interesting diverse people domestically and internationally. They can kind of take a look and see what it looks like going forward.\"\nFormer tennis great Serena Williams is co-owner of the Los Angeles team and her involvement prompts consideration over whether TGL missed a trick by not including some of the LPGA's top stars, such as Nelly Korda and Lydia Ko.\nLike LIV, TGL may struggle to win over traditional die-hard golf fans with its raucous environment, which is in stark contrast to the more genteel way golf is usually played.\nBut the new league was not brought in for the benefit of that constituency. It is there to broaden golf's base.\nSignificantly, the players seem to have enjoyed it and deem it worth incorporating into their early season schedules.\n\"Obviously it is a little bit of a challenge with everything we've got going through the year with our own schedules, but I don't think anyone has ever walked away and said 'this felt like a burden',\" Horschel stated after collecting his share of the $9m winners' spoils.\n\"I could never imagine what this was going to be,\" the reigning BMW PGA champion added. \"I remember coming into the arena in November and walking out and I was just in awe. I couldn't imagine what I was seeing.\n\"I described it like a football player walking into Mercedes-Benz Stadium right about to play, a basketball player walking out - Steph Curry walking out at Oracle Arena, stuff like that.\n\"Never imagined we'd be playing golf in an arena with a big simulator and people and music and chanting. It has been really cool and has sort of exceeded all of our expectations.\"",

This time, official communication to domestic teams didn't arrive, in some cases, until 20 minutes before the squad was confirmed.\nThe reasons for such secrecy remains unclear, though the approach does lend itself to preventing news leaking before the official announcement.\nPerhaps the most significant change for the players has been Tuchel's move to naming his starting XI on a matchday.\nSouthgate usually named his team the night before a fixture - while many players knew the XI based on the shape and personnel deployed in training.\nBut, for Friday's game against Albania, the players were informed of the team during a noon meeting on the day of the match.\nFor Monday's qualifier against Latvia, sources have indicated the players didn't know the full starting XI until about 16:00 - less than four hours before the game.\nCertain clues from training have also proved red herrings. For example, Morgan Rogers and Anthony Gordon featured heavily in shape training the day before the Albania game, causing many in camp to believe the pair would start the game.\nYet both started on the bench - though Rogers was named in the XI against Latvia.\nNot that the uncertainty over team selection appears to have hindered the players.\nSix points, five goals and two clean sheets represents an encouraging start for Tuchel.\nJordan Henderson and Dan Burn, two of Tuchel's most unexpected selections, were among the first through the door when the squad convened last Monday afternoon.\nThe players arrived to a flurry of broadcast activity, which has proved so popular with England's social media output.\nAt the club's Hilton hotel base at St George's Park, Tuchel has placed a keen emphasis on having various communal areas for his players to relax together.\nPlaying video games, of which Rice is said to be the squad standard-bearer, remains a popular pastime.\nSouthgate put a major emphasis on his players building a bond. Tuchel is determined to build on that existing camaraderie.\nIndeed, the England head coach stressed the importance of relationships in his first address to the team on Monday night.\nIn his opening speech, Tuchel reiterated they have just 24 training sessions together before USA 2026 gets under way.\nTo that end, the former Chelsea boss admitted he would not be making drastic changes to the playing style Southgate had developed.\nBased on the opening training sessions, it quickly became apparent that Tuchel would employ a four-man defence - despite conjecture the German would use a three-at-the-back system he relied on successfully at Chelsea.\nThe overriding message of Tuchel's address, though, was one of triumph and history.\n\"He said the goal was to put another star on the jersey,\" divulged Burn last week.\n\nThis video can not be played\nWhy you shouldn't want Tuchel's England peaking now\nWatch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer\nAn exciting start or lots of work needed?

Moving forward Tuchel views Harry Kane, Declan Rice and John Stones as the core spine of his team.\nAll three players were made aware of their importance well in advance of the German's first squad selection.\nIt will take injury or something drastic for the trio not to be named in England's starting XI at next year's World Cup finals, which they are expected to comfortably reach.\nYou can add Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka to names of almost guaranteed starters.\nIn camp, Tuchel has held one-to-one meetings with certain players with a view to discovering what makes them tick, but also to understand more who the leaders in his team are.\nTuchel likes big personalities, bordering on arrogance. A swagger. He's spent the past 10 days trying to figure out who those personalities are.\nThe media activities before Friday's win over Albania caused a stir.\nFirstly, a video clip of Reece James explaining why Tuchel was the best manager he'd worked with disappeared from ITV's social media just hours after it went live. \nIt was explained to BBC Sport that the video was removed because of embargo complications.\nThen came Tuchel's frank interview with ITV in which he said England lacked a clear identity under Southgate at Euro 2024, and that they were \"afraid\" to win the tournament.\nThe remarks were met with a mixed reaction, causing consternation among some within football amid a sense they are ill-informed and disrespectful to Southgate, particularly given England reached the final of the tournament.\nOthers have applauded Tuchel for his honesty. Similarly, the England players have been split on the merits of Tuchel's remarks.\nTime will tell whether Tuchel can fulfil his mission by lifting the World Cup in 16 months' time.\nIf he does, he will be doing it his way.",

Moving forward Tuchel views Harry Kane, Declan Rice and John Stones as the core spine of his team.All three players were made aware of their importance well in advance of the German's first squad selection.It will take injury or something drastic for the trio not to be named in England's starting XI at next year's World Cup finals, which they are expected to comfortably reach.You can add Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka to names of almost guaranteed starters.In camp, Tuchel has held one-to-one meetings with certain players with a view to discovering what makes them tick, but also to understand more who the leaders in his team are.Tuchel likes big personalities, bordering on arrogance.",

        "article_text": "A growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in job applications risks employers hiring candidates who cannot do the work, a business owner has said.\nAdvertising boss James Robinson said he and other business leaders were seeing a \"real trend\" in applicants using generative AI chatbots, and warned that candidates who were good at using the technology could \"engineer\" the process without being \"capable of doing the job\".\nCareers adviser Megan Cooper said that while AI could be a useful tool for job hunters, it should never replace \"human judgement\".\nA recent survey of more than 2,000 job applicants in the UK found just under half had used AI to help them with the application process.\nMr Robinson, who runs Hello Starling, a Cardiff-based advertising agency, said vacancies at his business were attracting applications that were riddled with AI-generated sentences.\n\"There are some common sentences that we see. People are always trying to 'leverage their skillset',\" he said.\n\"They're often saying things like 'my skills align with your organisation's objectives and goals'.\"\nHe said the chatbot ChatGPT confirmed that these were phrases it was likely to generate for a covering letter.\n\"[It is] very difficult for me to try and work out who is real, versus which ones are robots,\" he admitted.\nMr Robinson shared his experiences of receiving AI-generated job applications on LinkedIn and said the responses from other business leaders \"really surprised\" him.\n\"I was really, really surprised to receive messages from people saying, 'I'm in exactly the same boat as you. How are we going to tell them apart?' \n\"You know, 'do we need to be using AI to fight against this and get on top of it?' \n\"So I think it is a real challenge in itself, but I don't think that I'm alone.\"\nMr Robinson said however that \"appropriate\" use of AI could help his business, and that the technology was helping applicants to be more succinct in their applications.\nAI allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason, but scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can feel like it has been made by a human. It does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nAt Cardiff Metropolitan University, careers advisor Megan Cooper said she was trying to steer students through the ethics of using AI as they applied for jobs.\n\"AI can be used as a tool. It can be used as an aid. It's something that can complement, but absolutely not replace, human judgement,\" said Ms Cooper.\nMs Cooper said that in many cases, students were responding to an expectation from employers that candidates understood Generative AI and could use it with confidence.\n\"They don't want to be seen as cheating or getting it wrong in any way at all.\"\nShe said the university was encouraging students to understand when it was appropriate to use AI.\n\"Maybe that's in the research stages of the application process. It might be asking AI to give feedback or help structure their CV.\n\"Maybe it's asking AI to help read a cover letter that they have already written to help refine it and help it sound a little bit more eloquent.\"\nUltimately the job interview process required applicants to ensure \"what makes them unique is able to shine through\", she added.\nStudent Jasmine James, 18, said she was avoiding using AI for her university work.\n\"I feel like it's too much of a risk, with plagiarism and stuff like that,\" she said.\n\"But I can understand why people do use it, because it is a quicker and easier alternative. \n\"I just feel like the information isn't always correct, so it's best to avoid it for uni work.\"\nFellow student Jacob Morgan, 19, said he believed AI could be a \"really helpful tool\".\n\"I use it a lot, especially instead of Google. Sometimes I'll just search up on AI instead, because you get better results. So it's definitely very useful,\" he said.\nAI technology was \"here to stay\" and \"it's only going to get better and better\", he added.\nTimothy Mitchell, who is in his second year of studying computer security at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said he believed those who did not use artificial intelligence were \"cheating themselves\".\n\"Everybody uses it. Tutors use it, employers use it,\" he said.\nMr Mitchell accepted there were \"definitely some fears\" around the wider use of AI, \"but I personally believe they are somewhat unfounded\".\nHe added: \"What humans are best at is the creative stuff and creating new things. And AI, by principle, can't think beyond what it's been taught.\"\nGenerative AI could be used \"in a way that aids us rather than replaces us\", he added.",

He had missed the cut in his previous three outings, including starting the Players with a ruinous 80.\nBut the golfer believed the constant tinkering, the pursuit of perfection, to be entirely justified. \"It's not like I'm inventing stuff,\" he said.\nBut what he did realise was that he needed to go back to feels and methods that had previously worked. \"I have data that can show that what I used to do was objectively better than what I'm doing now.\n\"So why shouldn't I try to go back to what I used to do?\"\nHe reconnected with former coach Grant Waite while still pondering whether it was worth heading to Tampa for the tournament he ultimately won. \"I was not very hopeful with my game leading into this week,\" Hovland admitted.\nBetween them they found an old feel on the range last Tuesday.

And I really trust Grant, because he he sees it and knows what kind of matchups need to be there for it to work.\"\nHovland's win follows two PGA Tour victories for Northern Ireland's McIlroy already this year as well as big wins for Swede Ludvig Aberg, Austria's Sepp Straka and Belgium's Thomas Detry.\nThese results fuel optimism for a successful Ryder Cup defence for Europe at Bethpage in September. But do not get carried away.\nBack in 2023 Americans Scottie Scheffler, Max Homa and Sam Burns were posting victories at this time of year, while Brooks Koepka, Wyndham Clark and Brian Harman landed majors. But the US team were soundly beaten in Rome.\nThere are no guarantees in the sport that Rotella, who has advised a string of major winners, insists is not \"a game of perfect\".  So it should not be a surprise that even Hovland's short-term hopes for next month's Masters are tempered.\n\"Some of the shots that I'm hitting, it's going to make it really difficult for me to be in contention at Augusta,\" he admitted.\n\"You're going to hit so many long irons into par-four holes and you've got to drive it pretty far because the fairways are pretty wide.\n\"It's more of a bomber's paradise versus this place (Copperhead in Tampa) where it's more just about being precise off the tee.\n\"So there's still some things that I need to improve, but luckily we've got two weeks and this is certainly nice to have in the back of my mind leading up to Augusta.\"",

        "article_text": "People will be far more open-minded than you realise if you adopt these simple conversational techniques.\n\"The growth of knowledge depends entirely upon disagreement,\" claimed the philosopher Karl Popper. He was writing about the dangers of dogma in science \u2013 but his words could equally apply to anyone's worldview. And if you want a disagreement to end by changing someone's mind, you have to do it in the right way.\nAs I found in my recent book on social connection, new psychological research can help us to have more constructive conversations about controversial issues.\u00a0\nSome of the strategies surprised me. While some social media users are keen to remind us that \"facts don't care about your feelings\", studies suggest that people are considerably more likely to listen to our arguments if we talk about our personal experiences of the issues under discussion.\nOne of the main drivers of serious disagreement was apparent in the recent Friendship Study, which comprised a questionnaire I devised with psychologist Ian MacRae, offered to BBC.com readers in July and August of last year.\nIn one section, participants were asked to imagine a discussion with someone who disagreed with them about certain political or social issues. Afterwards, each participant was asked about their intentions \u2013 whether they aimed to persuade the other person, learn from them, or argue with them \u2013 and also their impression of the other person's intentions. Overall, the 1,912 participants overestimated how much other people wanted to persuade them of their point of view, and how much they were looking for an argument. At the same time, they underestimated how much the other person wanted to learn and understand the different opinions.\nThis is worth remembering whenever we find ourselves in a conflict: the other person may be more open to a good-faith discussion than we think, and we should treat them with the respect that entails.\nGiven that our conversation partner might underestimate our curiosity about their views, we should also make more effort to express our interest in their views. By demonstrating our good intentions to learn and understand, we will encourage them to lower their defences so that they are more open to an honest exchange of ideas.\nOften it is as simple as asking the right question. In the late 2000s, Frances Chen and colleagues at Stanford University invited students to engage in an online debate about whether the university should introduce a new set of exams. Unsurprisingly, many students were dead set against the idea. Crucially, they thought they were chatting to their peers, but their debating partners were really the experimenters themselves \u2013 who followed very rigid scripts that varied depending on whether the participant was in the experimental group or the control group.\nIn half of the conversations, the experimenters asked the students to elaborate on their views. For example, they might listen to a student's argument and respond: \"I was interested in what you're saying. Can you tell me more about how come you think that?\" For the other trials, the conversation did not include any request for more information on the participants' beliefs.\nIt was a tiny change in the script, but the addition of the single question changed the whole tone of the debate by provoking a considerably more open-minded response from the participants. They were more willing to continue the conversation and to receive further information on the other person's arguments, for instance.\nWe might be a little sceptical of the results from a single experiment, but Guy Itzchakov at the University of Haifa in Israel and his colleagues came to very similar conclusions in a series of studies involving hundreds of participants. Actively asking questions about people's beliefs and the reasons they hold those views leads them to lower their defences, so that they are considerably more receptive to alternative opinions.\u00a0\nAfter these kinds of conversations, participants were considerably more likely to agree with statements such as \"I feel that I ought to re-evaluate the event now, after the conversation\" \u2013 suggesting that they had become more thoughtful about the issues that they had discussed.\nWhile exchanging opinions, you shouldn't be afraid of sharing your first-hand experience of the issue at hand; indeed, it may just strengthen your argument.\nThis fact does not seem to be widely recognised. When Emily Kubin at the University of North Carolina and colleagues asked 251 participants to describe the best ways to present their opinion on an issue such as same-sex marriage or abortion, 56% chose the presentation of facts and evidence, while just 21% selected the expression of personal experience.\u00a0 \u00a0\nWe saw similar patterns within our Friendship Study. When we asked people to rate seven persuasion strategies, \"civility\" was number one, followed by \"logic and reason\". \"Personal experience\" came in at number five.\nKubin's experiments, however, suggest that it can be a potent tool of persuasion. Her team asked 177 participants to read about three people's opinions on topics like taxation, coal mining or gun control, before rating their respect for each person, and that person's rationality. No matter what their initial stance, the participants gave considerably higher ratings if they knew that the person had personal experience of the issue at hand.\nReading short texts online may seem a far cry from real-life encounters, but Kubin has also tested the principle in face-to-face dialogues on gun control, using a further sample of 153 local people who lived near the university. Once again, someone using a personal experience to portray their views commanded more respect from their conversation partner and was perceived to be more rational in their views.\nThere are, of course, good reasons to be wary of purely subjective accounts if they are not accompanied by any statistics, and an overreliance on an emotional appeal could raise the other person's suspicions. But the two approaches do not have to be mutually exclusive, and your point of view may be better received if you combine the two.\nConsider a recent examination of the 2018 midterm elections demonstrated. The study measured the progress of 230 canvassers, conversing on a range of political issues with 6,869 voters across seven US locations. Some were asked to make their case using purely statistical arguments \u2013 concerning, for instance, the common fear that immigration increases crime \u2013 while others were asked to exchange personal stories, in addition to presenting factual evidence.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Friendship in divided times: People don't want to argue with you as much as you think\n\u2022\u00a0Why do I feel so lonely even though I'm surrounded by people?\n\u2022\u00a0Seven ways to improve your sleep according to science\nEach of the voters took opinion polls before and after they met the canvassers. The researchers found that the mutually respectful exchange of experiences was more likely to shift opinion than conversations that focused more on impersonal facts and statistics.\nWhile the overall effects were small \u2013 resulting in a five-percentage-point shift in views on immigration, for example \u2013 this should be taken in context. On average, the conversations lasted just 11 minutes in total, yet a significant number of people started to change strongly held views.\u00a0\nThroughout your conversations, you should make sure that you maintain a basic level of civility \u2013 not only to your discussion partner, but also when you are talking about anyone else who may be involved in the debate, including public figures.\u00a0\nResearch by Jeremy Frimer at the University of Winnipeg and Linda Skitka at the University of Illinois at Chicago has shown that rude behaviour is far more likely to alienate the person you wish to persuade than change their opinion, and it may even disaffect people who were already coming around to your point of view. They describe this as the Montagu Principle, named after the 18th-Century English aristocrat Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who declared that \"civility costs nothing and buys everything\".\nBy demonstrating genuine curiosity, sharing your personal experiences, and maintaining a civil attitude, you may be surprised by your potential to connect \u2013 and gain a wiser worldview in the process.\n* David Robson is an award-winning science writer and author.

        "article_text": "Brazil were beaten 4-1 by Argentina in their most recent World Cup qualifier\nIn any previous World Cup, there would be genuine fear about Brazil failing to qualify. Not this time.\nIn an expanded competition, with six South American teams making it through automatically, Brazil have a six-point cushion over a Venezuela team who have just registered their first victory in 10 games.\nWith four rounds to go, it is impossible to see Brazil not making the cut. But that is hardly the point.\nFor Brazil, World Cup qualification now serves one purpose - it provides a sequence of competitive matches during which they hope to build a side capable of winning the trophy. And with just over a year to go until 2026, that looks a long way off.\nIt is easy to forget how good Brazil were in the last World Cup, where they lost in the quarter-finals on penalties to a Croatia team whose only shot on goal in the match took a cruel deflection.\nThe Qatar 2022 Brazil side were solid - goalkeeper Alisson could have taken a deckchair out for most of the games - with flashes of brilliance. They could have won that competition. \nSo why have they fallen back so much? How can a team packed with so many good players form such a dismal unit?\nThe team that were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina on Tuesday appeared to have no midfield, and were unable either to attack or defend.\nDorival Junior is under pressure following the heavy defeat by Argentina\nTuesday's prolonged humiliation did not come out of the blue. \nIn game after game the team have looked disjointed, without clear strategies for progressing the ball down the field, and suffering from the possibility of being both outplayed and outnumbered in central midfield. \nIndividual talent has papered over the cracks - like on Thursday, when a stoppage-time Vinicius Jr special gave them a victory over Colombia their play had not really deserved. \nBut it can't happen all the time.\nAnd if the film is bad, especially if the cast is impressive, the director must be to blame. \nThere is a crisis in Brazilian coaching. It is hard to produce coaches when there is no time to train and no job security. That is the reality of domestic Brazilian football, and helps explain why almost all of the successful coaches in the country are now foreign - either Argentine or, especially, Portuguese.\nThe national boss - for now anyway - Dorival Jr is a product of the domestic game, with more than four decades' experience as player and coach. \nBut on the international stage he comes across as a decent man thoroughly out of his depth.\nDid he really think he could travel to Argentina and play two men in central midfield? Why not drop deep and create space for the counter-attack, as he did a year ago against England at Wembley? And when cool heads were required, his team came across as a bag of nerves, all too willing to get involved in cheap spats.\nOf the three duties of the coach - pick the team, determine the strategy and set the emotional tone - Dorival failed dismally, and it is very hard to see how he can keep his job.\nIf he is to be replaced, there would seem to be two options. One is to go foreign - the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus would be a strong candidate. The other would be to fast-track former Chelsea left-back Filipe Luis - a man of great intelligence who has made an impressive start to his coaching career with Rio giants Flamengo.\nWhoever comes in - or Dorival if he manages to hang on - will have to deal with a simple observation - central midfield is not an optional extra.\nIt is an area where Brazil have had a problem for a while - a consequence of the 1990s trend of splitting the middle of the park into a pair of midfielders who only defend and a duo who mostly attack. It was at this point Brazilian play lost much of its former fluency, instead investing in rapid breaks down the flanks.\nIt is in this context that the problems of Lucas Paqueta are so significant. \nThe West Ham midfielder was on the verge of becoming a big-money Manchester City signing when scandal struck, and his career - now threatened - has not recovered.\nThe evidence of Dorival's first games in charge - a year ago away to England and Spain - was Paqueta had become the most important player in the team, the man capable of filling space in midfield, dictating the rhythm of the game and unleashing the pace of the likes of Vinicius Jr.\nRonaldo quits Brazil federation presidency race\nAlisson returns to Liverpool after 'suspected concussion'\nThe absence of Paqueta almost certainly led to Dorival building his hopes for these international dates around the return of Neymar - which, predictably, turned out to be ludicrously premature.\nAfter so long out injured, it was only to be expected that Neymar would run into muscular problems, and he will need much more time on the field to ease his way back to a level where he can tip the balance.\nAt 33, he is an unknown quantity. But there is a gaping hole in the team for the type of deep-lying playmaker role he could fill. \nRomantics might recall 2002, when Ronaldo looked all washed up only to make a triumphant return from injury and carry a Brazil side that almost failed to qualify all the way to World Cup title number five. \nThey are still waiting for number six. \nIf they can do it next year then, in the wake of Tuesday's humiliation, it will be a candidate for one of football's great comebacks.\nNeymar's absence from the Brazil team was prolonged by a muscular injury",

Eagles are third, six points behind Ghana, with four rounds of the 10-game campaign remaining.Ivory Coast moved to the top of Group F, a point ahead of Gabon, as Sebastien Haller's first-half header was enough to settle a nervy home encounter with The Gambia.Only the nine group winners in African qualifying are assured of a place at the expanded 48-team World Cup finals.The four best second-placed sides will play off for a space at an intercontinental qualifier which will provide the chance for a 10th side to reach the United States, Mexico and Canada.African World Cup qualifying scores and fixturesAfrican World Cup qualifying tablesElsewhere, Tunisia scored two late goals against 10-man Malawi to move four points clear at the top of Group H.The Flames, who had Lloyd Aaron sent off midway through the second half, frustrated the hosts in Rades until an unmarked Seifeddine Jaziri broke the deadlock with a back-post header in the 86th minute.Elias Achouri added a stoppage-time penalty and there was still time for Carthage Eagles goalkeeper Aymen Dahmen to keep out a 98th-minute spot kick from Richard Mbulu to preserve a clean sheet.Tunisia's closest challengers are Namibia, who drew 1-1 at home against Equatorial Guinea in neutral Polokwane.In Group A, Lassina Traore scored twice as Burkina Faso won 2-1 away against Guinea-Bissau to cut Egypt's lead at the top of the table to two points.Meanwhile, Bereket Desta and Abubeker Nasir both scored hat-tricks as Ethiopia registered their first victory by thrashing Djibouti 6-1.The sixth round of qualifiers will be completed on Tuesday, when there are 15 fixtures spread across eight groups.Ayew bags hat-trick of assistsGhana's dismal Afcon qualifying campaign at the end of last year means they will be missing from the tournament for the first time since 2004, but the West Africans are in pole position to secure back-to-back appearances at the World Cup finals.Partey gave the Black Stars the perfect start against Madagascar when the Arsenal midfielder powerfully met Jordan Ayew's pinpoint free-kick in the 11th minute.The same two players combined to make it 2-0 eight minutes into the second half as Partey again found space to head home Ayew's corner from the right.And five minutes later newly-appointed Ghana captain Ayew was the creator again, threading a through ball into the box for Kudus to convert.The Black Stars, who thrashed Chad 5-0 on Friday, extended their lead in Group I after Mali were frustrated by CAR in neutral Casablanca.The Eagles struggled to create clear chances, with Yves Bissouma firing a volley over the bar and Abdoulaye Diaby heading narrowly side.Haller header enough for ElephantsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sebastien Haller (left) scored his first international goal since his winner in the Africa Cup of Nations final last yearIvory Coast continued their unbeaten start in Group F, but the reigning African champions had goalkeeper Yahia Fofana to thank for several crucial saves in the second half against The Gambia.The Elephants had started well in Abidjan, as Brighton winger Simon Adingra clipped in a cross for Haller to guide home in the 15th minute.Mohammed Diomande rattled the crossbar for the hosts after the break but The Gambia carved out several chances on the counter attack as the game wore on.Fofana showed alertness to rush off his line to foil Alieu Fadera and shortly afterwards the Scorpions man skewed wide from 12 yards out.Fofana was called into action again to push away a low effort from Mahmudu Bajo, while Alassana Jatta placed his effort too close to the Elephants keeper with seven minutes remaining.The Gambia then came close to grabbing a point in stoppage time, but Fofana cut out Abdoulie Sanyang's cross before it reached Jatta, who was poised for a tap-in.Ivory Coast are yet to concede a goal in African World Cup qualifiers, but Emerse Fae's side have been far from convincing

I'm very happy with the result and we're going into the semi-finals.\"\nAlessia Russo was the star on a magical night at Emirates Stadium as she scored twice and had a further two goals ruled out for offside.\nEngland team-mate Chloe Kelly grabbed two assists, with Spain forward Mariona Caldentey joining Russo on the scoresheet during a ruthless second-half display which saw the Gunners score three times in 13 minutes.\nIt was only the second time a club has overturned a two-goal first-leg deficit in the quarter-finals of the competition, with Arsenal having done so against Torres in 2004, losing 2-0 away before a 4-1 home success.\n\"Without a doubt, that Arsenal team ran all over Real Madrid,\" said former England captain Steph Houghton on BBC Radio 5 Live. \n\"In those 13 minutes, where they scored three goals, they were absolutely relentless and that's what you have to be at this level. They were outstanding.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nOnly Lyon have scored more goals in the Women's Champions League this season\nFans were on their feet at full-time, singing and waving scarves as the players walked around the pitch receiving their deserved plaudits.\nIt had been a complete performance from the Gunners - a total turnaround from their placid display in Spain a week before when they lost 2-0.\nThey pressed with intensity, tested Real Madrid's defence with Kelly's teasing balls and could rely on Russo's sharpness in front of goal. \n\"It was electric - a masterful gameplan from Renee Slegers and well executed by the Arsenal players,\" said ex-England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley on 5 Live. \"They had to go for it.\n\"They had so many opportunities in the first half and managed to capitalise in the second half and that's what counts. Real Madrid had nothing left.\"\nArsenal have had their fair share of success stories at Emirates Stadium. But in a rollercoaster campaign, this was a wonderful high, and a result that will stand out as they booked an eighth semi-final appearance in the competition. \nSlegers' first victory in charge as interim manager, a day after Eidevall resigned, was in this competition when Arsenal overcame Valerenga 4-1. \nIt felt a stretch then to consider them as European semi-finalists but now, having booked their spot in the last four, Slegers admitted this was \"probably the clearest\" example of their character to fight back.\n\"We have done really good things before, coming back from setbacks and good performances against top teams,\" she added. \n\"But this is definitely one of the clearest ones where you play an opponent away, the game looks like it does, the result is what it is, then you have to put this performance and result in.\"\nThis video can not be played\nI have massive belief in our team - Russo\nHaving come so close to a first Arsenal hat-trick, Russo could have been forgiven for feeling frustrated at full-time.\nTwo video assistant referee (VAR) interventions meant she had two goals chalked off for offside, either side of a wasted opportunity when one-on-one with visiting goalkeeper Misa Rodriguez.\nBut the England forward celebrated at the final whistle and said the thought of being in the last four had \"not sunk in yet\".\n\"It was just amazing - the result, the fans, playing at the Emirates... it just doesn't get old,\" Russo told BBC Sport.\n\"When we went to Madrid we were disappointed, but we knew we had the belief and we knew what we needed to do. There was disappointment and it turned into fire quite quickly.\"\nHer contribution, alongside that of team-mate Kelly, played a key role in Arsenal's courageous comeback and Houghton said it showed Russo's \"maturity\".\nShe is now the joint-top scorer in the Champions League with six goals and has 17 in all competitions for her best goalscoring season to date.\n\"She got a lot of criticism at the beginning of the season and was probably doing too much work for the team - not being selfish enough as a striker,\" added Houghton.\n\"She showed a real maturity about her display [against Real Madrid]. Almost everything she touched went in the back of the net. \n\"She's got the goals that have sent Arsenal into a semi-final of the Champions League.\"\nAlessia Russo is the joint-top goalscorer in the Women's Champions League this season with six goals - level with Pernille Harder",

        "article_text": "England head coach Thomas Tuchel shows his frustration during the World Cup qualifier against Latvia at Wembley\nThomas Tuchel wants England's brave new era to bring thrills and excitement, but he has swiftly discovered that if you have seen one England qualifier you have almost seen them all.\nTuchel has been firing off positive messages since delivering a damning verdict on England's Euro 2024 campaign under predecessor Gareth Southgate, which he claimed lacked intensity, identity and hunger.\nDuring the routine 3-0 win over a Latvia side ranked 140th in the world, it was clear Tuchel's intended transformation will not be a quick fix - because this was more of the same labouring old England seen so often under Southgate.\nThe Three Lions, as they have done so many times before, finally overcame gallant but limited opposition after struggling for long periods to make the most of their superiority, too often pedestrian and too often failing to transform good positions into goals.\nThere was the traditional Wembley backdrop of paper aeroplanes - with the first hitting the turf after 14 minutes as opposed to 33 against Albania - the Mexican wave and the thousands of empty seats well before the final whistle.\nAnd there were even the old frustrations that have surfaced before in this type of attritional fixture, with Jude Bellingham - who was already on a yellow card - fortunate referee Orel Grinfeld took a lenient view of his reckless second-half challenge on Raivis Jurkovskis.\nEngland got there in the end, as they always do in these qualifiers, with Reece James illuminating his first international start since September 2022 with a superb free-kick seven minutes from half-time to break the deadlock.\nLatvia, unsurprisingly, barely left their half after the break, and England put the result beyond doubt with two goals in eight minutes.\nCaptain Harry Kane scored his 71st goal in 105 international appearances with a simple tap-in after 68 minutes and substitute Eberechi Eze added the hosts' third with a deflected shot.\nAll very routine. All very England when it comes to qualifiers - as it should be against a country ranked between Burundi and the Dominican Republic on Fifa's list.\nEze scores first England goal as Three Lions beat Latvia \nWho can be 'a real asset'? England player ratings v Latvia\nEngland labour to Latvia win in World Cup qualifying\nReece James (centre) scored a superb free-kick on his first international start since September 2022\nThis is not, it must be stressed, a criticism of Tuchel, whose tenure in its infancy.\nIt is simply a confirmation that providing the sort of thrill ride the German coach wants to serve up for England fans is easier said than done in these types of games with this team, and there is no quick fix to change that.\nIf Tuchel thought he could quickly blow away the cobwebs he believed had gathered on Southgate's England, then his first two games in charge will have been a sobering dose of reality.\nThere has been little, so far, to distinguish Tuchel's team from the one that went before it.\nFor long periods this was a deadly dull England performance. \nTuchel, in some respects, has made a rod for his own back with his deeply unflattering review of the Three Lions' efforts in Germany last summer and his talk of change.\nEngland did do some of the things their new boss demanded. He wants more touches in the opposition box - and that figure more than doubled from his first game against Albania, increasing from 34 on Friday to 69 against Latvia.\nThey put in 36 crosses on a night when they enjoyed 73.5% possession, but the end product was poor. Marcus Rashford improved slightly on his performance against Albania, but Jarrod Bowen could not make the desired impact as a replacement for struggling Phil Foden.\nEngland sent in 21 of those crosses in the first half, the most in a game since they played Poland in October 2013 and delivered 25 - but their only goal game from James' free-kick.\nIn a sign of England's complete domination, they had 569 successful passes in Latvia's half compared to the visitors' 26 in theirs, and must be disappointed such overwhelming statistics resulted in relatively meagre results.\nTuchel wants to give England a fresh identity as they try to cross the psychological barrier from a nearly team to winners, but - as so often in the past - the acid test will only truly come when (it is hardly if) they qualify for the 2026 World Cup.\nQualifying should be a formality from a group that also contains Andorra and Serbia, so the first high-quality opponents England are likely to meet will be when they get to the World Cup. \nIt is a situation they have been in before - and then been found wanting when it matters.\nWho makes your England World Cup starting XI?\n'We will get there' - who were winners & losers for Tuchel's England?\nJude Bellingham was fortunate not to receive a second yellow card for a reckless challenge on Raivis Jurkovskis\nThis a problem for Tuchel to solve and one he will be well aware of.\nBut the 51-year-old will have enjoyed the spectacular strike from James, a player he greatly admires and who was a vital part of his Chelsea team that won the Champions League in 2021.\nKane's second was also right up the head coach's street, with Declan Rice accelerating into the Latvia area, collecting Morgan Rogers' pass and drilling a ball across the face of the six-yard box which left his captain with a simple finish.\nWhat will cheer Tuchel is that he has plenty of raw materials to work with.\nBellingham, for all the impetuosity that could - and should - have seen him sent off on Monday, is a generational talent, while Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly has demonstrated he is a natural at this level.\nThere was more good news from The Hawthorns where another Gunner, Ethan Nwaneri, excelled in a goalscoring performance for England Under-21s - and the return of a third Arsenal player, Bukayo Saka, will offer an added attacking dimension.\nTuchel's task is to find the \"X Factor\", the missing ingredient, to get England's men over the line they have failed to cross since the 1966 World Cup.\nTwo wins from two games is a satisfactory - and totally expected - opening to the Tuchel era, but now he must discover the missing link to enable him to deliver the exciting England side he has promised.\nAnd on the somewhat tedious evidence of his first two games, Tuchel will have plenty to exercise his mind between now and the next international camp in June.",

It is a situation they have been in before - and then been found wanting when it matters.Who makes your England World Cup starting XI?Published6 hours ago'We will get there' - who were winners & losers for Tuchel's England?Published5 hours agoImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jude Bellingham was fortunate not to receive a second yellow card for a reckless challenge on Raivis JurkovskisThis a problem for Tuchel to solve and one he will be well aware of.But the 51-year-old will have enjoyed the spectacular strike from James, a player he greatly admires and who was a vital part of his Chelsea team that won the Champions League in 2021.Kane's second was also right up the head coach's street, with Declan Rice accelerating into the Latvia area, collecting Morgan Rogers' pass and drilling a ball across the face of the six-yard box which left his captain with a simple finish.What will cheer Tuchel is that he has plenty of raw materials to work with.Bellingham, for all the impetuosity that could - and should - have seen him sent off on Monday, is a generational talent, while Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly has demonstrated he is a natural at this level.There was more good news from The Hawthorns where another Gunner, Ethan Nwaneri, excelled in a goalscoring performance for England Under-21s - and the return of a third Arsenal player, Bukayo Saka, will offer an added attacking dimension.Tuchel's task is to find the \"X Factor\", the missing ingredient, to get England's men over the line they have failed to cross since the 1966 World Cup.Two wins from two games is a satisfactory - and totally expected - opening to the Tuchel era, but now he must discover the missing link to enable him to deliver the exciting England side he has promised.And on the somewhat tedious evidence of his first two games, Tuchel will have plenty to exercise his mind between now and the next international camp in June.Related topicsFootballEngland Men's Football Team Marcus Rashford improved slightly on his performance against Albania, but Jarrod Bowen could not make the desired impact as a replacement for struggling Phil Foden.England sent in 21 of those crosses in the first half, the most in a game since they played Poland in October 2013 and delivered 25 - but their only goal game from James' free-kick.In a sign of England's complete domination, they had 569 successful passes in Latvia's half compared to the visitors' 26 in theirs, and must be disappointed such overwhelming statistics resulted in relatively meagre results.Tuchel wants to give England a fresh identity as they try to cross the psychological barrier from a nearly team to winners, but - as so often in the past - the acid test will only truly come when (it is hardly if) they qualify for the 2026 World Cup.Qualifying should be a formality from a group that also contains Andorra and Serbia, so the first high-quality opponents England are likely to meet will be when they get to the World Cup. All very England when it comes to qualifiers - as it should be against a country ranked between Burundi and the Dominican Republic on Fifa's list.Eze scores first England goal as Three Lions beat Latvia Who can be 'a real asset'?",

        "article_text": "The musician, producer and Real Housewives: Atlanta breakout star loves her hometown. Here are her top local picks, from brunch at Toast to people watching at the Beltline.\nAtlanta \u2013 the state capital of Georgia and the unofficial capital of the American South \u2013 started its life as a railroad terminus in 1837 and has served as a hub for American culture ever since.\nThe SpeciaList\nKandi Burruss is an Atlanta born-and-based musician, producer, actor, business owner and reality TV star. She has worked with celebrities like Ariana Grande and Ed Sheeran, and her work on the single No Scrubs earned her a Grammy Award in 1999. She is the owner of Bedroom\u00a0Kandi, a line of sex toys; Kandi Koated cosmetics; and hosts a podcast called The Business of Pleasure. In addition to appearing on The Real Housewives of Atlanta for 14 seasons, Burruss recently starred in Showtime's The Chi and Hulu's Reasonable Doubt. In 2021, the Atlanta suburb South Fulton declared 18 December Kandi Burruss Tucker Day.\nRanking among the top cities for US tourism, Atlanta consistently draws visitors with its dynamic contemporary art scene and iconic soul food, as well as its abundance of greenery and sprawling historic estates. One of the main epicentres of the hip hop industry, it has also secured its place in music history, nurturing a long line of homegrown talent \u2013 like Kandi Burruss, the Atlanta-born singer, songwriter, producer and star of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\nThe future songstress was raised in the Atlanta suburb of East Point, where she attended Tri-Cities High School of Visual and Performing Arts and met the other members of R&B girl group Xscape; later going on to co-write the 1993 hit No Scrubs for TLC. Burruss joined the Real Housewives of Atlanta cast for its sophomore season in 2010, becoming a fan favourite and one of the longest-tenured housewives before leaving the show in 2024. Her latest venture takes her to New York City as she and her husband, Todd Tucker, co-produce the new Broadway production of Othello at the Barrymore Theatre, starring Academy Award winners Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal.\nBut Burruss is an Atlanta girl through and through.\u00a0\"I was born and raised in Atlanta, so I am Atlanta,\" she says. \"This is home base for me.\"\nHer time on Real Housewives allowed her to celebrate her Atlanta roots, and chronicled meeting her husband and the birth of her son, Ace. \"It's been kind of cool to say I can go back and watch 14 years of my life,\" she says. \"It was a great experience.\"\nCameras followed Burruss and her co-stars as they crisscrossed the city to attend fashion shows; local restaurants, like 80-year-old Mary Mac's Tea Room; and major landmarks like the Georgia Aquarium, which set the scene for one of the show's beloved end-of-season reunions.\nBurruss owns various enterprises in town, including two restaurants and her business camp The Kandi Factory HQ (\"You have to have an invite,\" she says), which put her at the heart of Atlanta's often over-the-top social scene.\u00a0\n\"Atlanta is a vibe,\" she declares. \"It\u2019s a great place for work, fun, and the weather hits all four seasons; it\u2019s such a place to be.\"\nHere are Burruss's favourite ways to experience her hometown of Atlanta.\nIf visitors are looking to drop some major coin, Burruss isn't against hitting up some of the most recognisable spots in Atlanta.\n\"People always go to Lenox [Square] or Phipps [Plaza] if they want to shop,\" she says.\nBoth malls are in the city's upscale Buckhead neighbourhood and include the designer labels that Burruss and her co-stars wear on the show, like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior. The Waldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckhead and the InterContinental Buckhead Altanta hotels, both located nearby, played host to the Real Housewives of Atlanta for various events, like Nene Leakes's wedding in 2013.\nWebsite: https://www.simon.com/mall/lenox-square/\nAddress: 3393 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326\nPhone: +14042336767\nInstagram: @lenoxsqmall\nWebsite: https://www.simon.com/mall/phipps-plaza\nAddress: 3500 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326\nPhone: +14042620992\nInstagram: @shopphippsplaza\nAtlanta has 53 restaurants listed in the Michelin Guide (and eateries like Fishmonger and Staplehouse have taken top spots on Bon App\u00e9tit's Best New Restaurants listings in recent years), but diners can also enjoy the city's iconic Southern dishes like fried chicken at The Busy Bee Cafe and peach cobbler at Ms Ruby's Peach Cobbler Caf\u00e9 in Buckhead.\nAnyone looking to refuel after a late night or keep the party going after a big celebration can opt for brunch; another reality TV standby. While Burruss famously doesn't imbibe, she's happy to recommend her favourite spot.\n\"If I wanted to get up and go to brunch, it's a place called Toast. They have a great brunch,\" Burruss says of the trendy eatery, found just outside of Atlanta's Buckhead neighbourhood. \"The food is really good.\"\nVisitors can feast on \"New American Brunch\" dishes like strawberry-shortcake French toast or fried catfish and grits, while fans of Real Housewives will recognise the restaurant as the spot where Burruss feuded with her co-star Marlo Hampton at Shere\u00e9 Whitfield's Keepin' it Gucci brunch in 2023.\nWebsite: https://www.toastonlenoxatl.com/\nAddress: 2770 Lenox Rd Suite B-1, Atlanta, GA 30324\nPhone: +14047484594\nInstagram: @toastonlenox\nAs Burruss knows, getting a group of girlfriends together is no easy feat. So she looks for venues with good vibes and good music to accompany any tea that might get spilled (gossip) when she and her girls get together.\n\"My friend Rasheeda owns a place called Frost Bistro. We might hang out there, because they play good music,\" Burruss says. Fans of reality TV may also remember the restaurant from VH1's Love & Hip Hop Atlanta. Rasheeda and Kirk Frost, who have headlined the show since 2012, opened the casual Southern-style bistro back in 2020, offering a breakfast and brunch menu full of inventive cocktails and modern, stick-to-your-ribs Georgia-style dishes.\u00a0\n\"I like the oxtail and grits, the snapper and the French toast,\" says Burruss.\nWebsite: https://frostbistro.com/\nAddress: 281 Peters St SW, Atlanta, GA 30313\nPhone: +14049635495\nInstagram: @frostbistro\n\nAtlantic Station is a favourite for locals and tourists, thanks to its views, restaurants and family-friendly attractions.\nWhen to come\n\"The summer is fun,\" says Burruss. \"It\u2019s never just one event; it\u2019s a ton of events. People are out all summer long. It's consistent. That's what I love about Atlanta \u2013 there\u2019s always multiple things happening.\"\nThe building was once a steel mill and has since been transformed into a collection of boutiques, eateries and apartments. Its location between Atlanta's West Side, Home Park and South Buckhead makes it easy for visitors to get to no matter where they're coming from.\n\"You want to go to Atlantic Station. They always have a lot of kids hanging out and playing,\" Burruss says. \"I just took my son and his friends to Skyline Park at Ponce City Market. [They] have great restaurants in that building and on the rooftop is where Skyline Park is. So, you get an amazing view of the city.\"\nJust 15 minutes from Atlantic Station,\u00a0Skyline Park includes a miniature golf course, a three-storey slide, and Heege Tower, which gives riders a 360-degree view of Bucktown, Midtown and downtown Atlanta.\u00a0\nWebsite: https://atlanticstation.com/\nAddress: 1380\u00a0Atlantic Dr NW,\u00a0Atlanta,\u00a0GA\u00a030363\nPhone: +14049007900\nInstagram: @atlanticstation \nIn a past life, Atlanta's Beltline was a rail corridor that circled the city. Now, it's a pedestrian-friendly path where Burruss goes to soak up the sun. The star notes that it attracts people from all over the city, making it prime for people-watching. Its trails extend more than 11 miles and notable stops include the Atlanta Beltline Arboretum, The Beacon and Krog Street Market. Public art is on display, too, including rotating exhibitions of sculptures, murals and performances throughout the year.\n\"Especially when the weather is good,\" Burrus says. \"That's a fun time, because I like to just walk and people-watch. There's stops along the way where you can eat. In the summer, I like to ride my bike on the Beltline. I think that's kind of cool and fun.\"\nWebsite: https://beltline.org/\nAddress: 619 Edgewood Ave SE, Atlanta, GA 30312\nPhone: +14044773003\nInstagram: @atlantabeltline \n\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

They are paid by the company that is buying the goods as opposed to the overseas business that is selling the product. \nSince taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly used tariffs - or the threat of them - in an attempt to gain leverage in a range of disputes, only some of which are related to trade. \nHe said on Monday he still planned to impose tariffs on specific products, including cars, lumber and computer chips, claiming the possibility of such measures were already helping to spur investment in the US. \nHis latest threat against Venezuela is expected to raise pressure on current buyers of oil - which include China, India and Spain - to reduce their dealings in the country, which have provided a critical financial lifeline to the Venezuelan government. \nTrump has already raised tariffs on Chinese imports to at least 20% since February.  He told reporters he intended the latest announcement to be added on top of existing levies.\nFor Venezuela, China is a major buyer of its oil. But Venezuela is not a big source of crude for China, which imported more than 11 million barrels per day last year. \nThe US is a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, as a result of exemptions from economic sanctions granted to US oil firm Chevron. \nThe Trump administration has previously signalled its intention to end those exemptions.\nOn Monday, the administration updated its order, giving Chevron until 27 May to wind down its operations in Venezuela, extending the deadline by two months.\nChevron declined to comment. \nOil prices rose more than 1% after the announcement.",

        "article_text": "What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms?\nIt's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates.\nAfter a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year.\nAnalysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted.\nOver the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments. \nBanking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth.\nData from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments. \nSo why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that?\nWeak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note.\nBut beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year.\nSlowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects.\nInvestments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption.\nIndia's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption.\nWith all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say.\nAccording to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047.\nKey to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates.\nThe government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020.\nBut none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending.\nAccording to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities.\nIndia's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year.\n\"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year.\nRathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite.\n\"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC.\nHe said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up.\n\"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added.\nBut things could be turning a corner, according to Icra.\nInterest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report.\nIndia's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen. \nThe uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.\nThese White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.\nThat an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.\nAnd that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.\n\"This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X.\nDemocratic congressman Chris Deluzio said in a press statement that the House Armed Services Committee, on which he sits, must conduct a full investigation and hearing on the matter as soon as possible.\n\"This is an outrageous national security breach, and heads should roll,\" he said.\nCriticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either.\nDon Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was \"unconscionable\".\n\"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,\" he said of Waltz's messaging. \"Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone.\"\nWith Republicans in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump's own party would have to initiate any kind of formal congressional investigation into the matter.\nRepublican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error.\n\"They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said. \"I don't know what else you can say about that.\"\nTrump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.\nThe White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz. \nBy Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.\nIn its afternoon statement, the White House noted that the strikes were \"highly successful and effective\". That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team.\nJD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen.\nWhile the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action.\nHe noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal.\n\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"\nThe vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\".\n\"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\nThis is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy.\nDick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky.\nThis is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines. Both Trump and Joe Biden were investigated for their possession of classified information after leaving office. Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for alleged violations related to his refusal to turn over material stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence \u2013 a case that was dropped when Trump won re-election last year.\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for communications while US secretary of state became a major issue during her unsuccessful presidential campaign.\nLike this White House group chat, some of those messages provided insight into the inner workings of Clinton's team.\nTheir revelation also proved to be politically damaging. A handful of her stored messages were later deemed to contain \"top secret\" information.\n\"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign \u2013 one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law.\nOn Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" she wrote.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

We were all taken aback but I didn't understand that I was apparently the culprit.\nI got in the car but didn't really understand the extent of it until I got to the arena and online there was a photo of Sandy, who was stripped down with red paint on her. ESPN came in to see me and apparently I'm being blamed for the attack.\nEveryone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me - it's not my style. I expected her to try to blame me. I was her rival all week but there were also other things going on. \nSandy has already said flyers attacking her were put up around the hotel and city.\nYou can't just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me. I was upstairs waiting to walk down for the fight of my life. \nI didn't know what time she was going to be down there or that she was going first. The only people who knew were her team - maybe she should look inside her own circle.\nThe incident took me by surprise but I was in fight mode and it didn't happen to me, so I wasn't flustered.\nIf someone had thrown paint on me I would have slapped paint on the ass of my fight shorts and got on with it.\nI was concerned that she was going to pull out - her team were really getting her going about it.\nThere was a clip of her coach Kay Koroma in the locker room screaming at her to pull out of the fight which I thought was super suspicious. That was weird to me and out of character for him. \nI really don't think it was the paint that threw her off her game but her team, who made it a bigger deal than it had to be.\nObviously I don't want that to happen and I hope it doesn't happen going into this fight. It could have been called off and, after two years of busting my butt to get back in that position, that was the last thing I wanted.\nAs for 'paint-gate' being used to promote the rematch, I was surprised the Top Rank team used the paint on the promotion posters - but this is entertainment. \nI didn't have any say in it. If I had done anything like that, my manager would have had my neck as he tries to keep me professional.\nI didn't know about it until the poster came out and I said, 'do they have red paint on Sandy?'\nI was just as taken aback as anyone else, but it's kind of funny.\nMayer (right) beat Ryan (left) by majority decision with one judge scoring it a draw\nIt's important for women's boxing to have these rivalries and this is definitely up there as one of the top ones.\nI never counted out the rematch and just wanted to see what my other options were. Once I saw the views and how much the fans wanted it - and the excuses - I thought let's do it again and I'll do it even better.\nI didn't get my rematch with Alycia Baumgardner so I understand Sandy might have been frustrated, but I didn't have to give her this rematch. I could have just sat it out, waited for Lauren Price to unify and fought for undisputed or faced someone else. \nThat's not the fighter I am though.\nI pride myself on the fact a lot of the fights I have been in are competitive and people aren't sure who will win. \nMy feud with Alycia will stay number one for a lifetime, but Sandy can come second because of the coaching team situation and the paint situation.\nSandy and her team have tried to gaslight me in a sense where I'm supposed to be making all of this up or I'm being dramatic, but it happened.\nYou're going to see coach Koroma, my coach of eight or nine years since the Olympics, in her corner so they really can't say anything about it. They did what they did and they have to stand by that. \nI'm just protecting myself and I'm the one who had to go out and find a whole new team at this stage of my career which is not easy.

Amongst charity workers, donors and friends, he spoke of the love and happiness he had found with Meghan, of honouring his mother's legacy, and described his \"sadness\" at leaving the UK.\n\"Together, you have given me an education about living, and this role has taught me more about what is right and just than I could ever have imagined,\" he told dinner guests.\n\"We are taking a leap of faith, so thank you for giving me the courage to take this next step.\"\nSentebale had been part of Prince Harry's world for his entire adult life. It had ridden the storm of family fallout and leaving royal life behind.\nHe first visited Lesotho, the landlocked mountain kingdom in southern Africa, when he was 19, in 2004. He'd just left Eton and was on a gap year before his military training at Sandhurst.\nIt was a formative time for Harry.\nWhat he saw during his gap year prompted him to set up the charity two years later.\nIt would support children who had lost parents to HIV and Aids.\nAnd then there is the Diana factor. Sentebale means \"forget-me-not\" in Sesotho, the language of Lesotho.\nBack at that Sentebale dinner in 2020, he told guests: \"When I lost my mum\u2026 you took me under your wing. You looked out for me for so long.\"\nThe connection to Diana, Princess of Wales, is an important personal part of the Sentebale story.\nHis joint founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, had also lost his mother.

Seeiso was a guest at his wedding in Windsor in 2018. He'd also been at the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales at Westminster Abbey seven years earlier.\nThis makes their joint decision to walk away from Sentebale all the more powerful.\nPrince Harry's move to the US has impacted his ability to be hands-on with some of his charity work. But his team in California say he remains a strong supporter of them all and plays an active part in what they do.\nHe last visited Lesotho in 2024 and, with Prince Seeiso, saw the latest work the charity was doing. His commitment to the charity would \"never falter\", he said.\nBut, for now, Prince Harry has walked away in what has clearly been a catastrophic breakdown in the trustees' relationship with the chair of the board.\nThere has been a personal fallout, a wrangle over the charity's future direction, and broken relationships with damaging accusations being made.\nPrince Harry has been here before.",

People are always trying to 'leverage their skillset',\" he said.\n\"They're often saying things like 'my skills align with your organisation's objectives and goals'.\"\nHe said the chatbot ChatGPT confirmed that these were phrases it was likely to generate for a covering letter.\n\"[It is] very difficult for me to try and work out who is real, versus which ones are robots,\" he admitted.\nMr Robinson shared his experiences of receiving AI-generated job applications on LinkedIn and said the responses from other business leaders \"really surprised\" him.\n\"I was really, really surprised to receive messages from people saying, 'I'm in exactly the same boat as you. How are we going to tell them apart?' \n\"You know, 'do we need to be using AI to fight against this and get on top of it?' \n\"So I think it is a real challenge in itself, but I don't think that I'm alone.\"\nMr Robinson said however that \"appropriate\" use of AI could help his business, and that the technology was helping applicants to be more succinct in their applications.\nAI allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human.\nComputers cannot think, empathise or reason, but scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.\nGenerative AI is used to create new content which can feel like it has been made by a human. It does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.\nAt Cardiff Metropolitan University, careers advisor Megan Cooper said she was trying to steer students through the ethics of using AI as they applied for jobs.\n\"AI can be used as a tool. It can be used as an aid. It's something that can complement, but absolutely not replace, human judgement,\" said Ms Cooper.\nMs Cooper said that in many cases, students were responding to an expectation from employers that candidates understood Generative AI and could use it with confidence.\n\"They don't want to be seen as cheating or getting it wrong in any way at all.\"\nShe said the university was encouraging students to understand when it was appropriate to use AI.\n\"Maybe that's in the research stages of the application process. It might be asking AI to give feedback or help structure their CV.\n\"Maybe it's asking AI to help read a cover letter that they have already written to help refine it and help it sound a little bit more eloquent.\"\nUltimately the job interview process required applicants to ensure \"what makes them unique is able to shine through\", she added.\nStudent Jasmine James, 18, said she was avoiding using AI for her university work.\n\"I feel like it's too much of a risk, with plagiarism and stuff like that,\" she said.\n\"But I can understand why people do use it, because it is a quicker and easier alternative. \n\"I just feel like the information isn't always correct, so it's best to avoid it for uni work.\"\nFellow student Jacob Morgan, 19, said he believed AI could be a \"really helpful tool\".\n\"I use it a lot, especially instead of Google. Sometimes I'll just search up on AI instead, because you get better results. So it's definitely very useful,\" he said.\nAI technology was \"here to stay\" and \"it's only going to get better and better\", he added.\nTimothy Mitchell, who is in his second year of studying computer security at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said he believed those who did not use artificial intelligence were \"cheating themselves\".\n\"Everybody uses it. Tutors use it, employers use it,\" he said.\nMr Mitchell accepted there were \"definitely some fears\" around the wider use of AI, \"but I personally believe they are somewhat unfounded\".\nHe added: \"What humans are best at is the creative stuff and creating new things. And AI, by principle, can't think beyond what it's been taught.\"\nGenerative AI could be used \"in a way that aids us rather than replaces us\", he added.",

After periods of introspection and self-analysis, Bellamy the coach is a different person, one who prides himself on his composure and analytical eye.\nPlayers have talked of his considered team talks and detailed tactical presentations; his interviews with the media have been measured, thoughtful and wide-ranging.\nBut in North Macedonia on Tuesday night, when Wales bundled in an added-time equaliser after a conclusion of stupefying drama, that cool veneer disappeared in an instant.\nAs David Brooks' shot crept over the line, an ecstatic Bellamy leapt in the air and roared with delight. His feet had barely touched the ground when he was asked to summarise his feelings.\n\"My main reaction? Probably shock, still,\" he said.\n\"Calm? Not at all. Even now, I'm not. I thought it would have been difficult to accept losing today. But you have to accept certain things as much as you don't want to.\n\"As a coach you try to teach the players. I hope they learn from me but, I always feel as a coach, you learn from the players. Today's given me so much, like the character.\"\nThis video can not be played\n2026 World Cup qualification: David Brooks nets late equaliser for Wales\nThe injury-time chaos warped the narrative arc of the game.\nWales had dominated for 90 minutes but looked to have fallen for a sucker punch when substitute Joe Allen's backpass was picked off by Bojan Miovski, whose goal had sparked jubilant celebrations among the home players and fans.\nThen came the bedlam as Wales disposed with Bellamy's modus operandi of patient build-up play and launched the ball to big Kieffer Moore, who nodded the ball down for fellow substitute David Brooks to force the ball over the line from close range.\nFor all the unfiltered joy of that moment, however, Bellamy could not hide his frustration.\n\"To watch it happen was like 'Wow' but, at the same time, to come away with a point actually leaves me disappointed, I have to be honest, due to the performance,\" he said.\n\"In the manner, then we have to take it of course. If I look at the game, we were in control but football can find a cruel way sometimes.\n\"Maybe because I haven't suffered defeat in a short reign but I still felt there was something more.\"\nThis was Bellamy's eighth game in charge of Wales and he still hasn't lost yet, with four wins and four draws leading to Nations League promotion and a solid start to World Cup qualifying.\nHis frustration was understandable in Skopje. North Macedonia offered very little, while Wales could not convert their possessional domination into the three points it warranted.\nOnce the elation of the celebrations subsides, Bellamy will ensure that Wales know this was an opportunity missed.\nWales are second in Group J, behind early leaders North Macedonia on goal difference, but greater challenges await with top seeds Belgium yet to play.\n\"It could have been a very precious one [point]. I feel probably on the performance, I think the way I looked at the game today, I think we needed three. It could turn out to be an important point but time will tell,\" Bellamy added.\n\"We know in international football, chances can be limited at times but we had our big chances as well. On reflection of the game, maybe we needed to take three.\"",
