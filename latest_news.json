        "article_text": "In 11th-Century England, a dark-skinned saint with a promiscuous past became a boundary-breaking cultural and religious icon. A new study is hoping to reassert her place in history.\nShe was old. She was dark-skinned. As a young woman, she had been promiscuous and enjoyed sex. But after rejecting the world and spending 47 years living naked in the desert, Saint Mary of Egypt became a wise and virtuous teacher of Christian scripture \u2013 or so 11th Century readers were led to believe.\nWhen the extraordinary legend of Saint Mary was first translated into Old English from Latin by an unknown author just over a millennium ago, it became the medieval equivalent of a blockbuster, copied multiple times and translated into Old Norse, Welsh, Irish and eventually Middle English.\nNow, Cambridge University is seeking to solve the mystery of how and why the tale of this \"rebellious\" saint appealed to readers in 11th-Century England, and reassert the rightful place in history of Saint Mary \u2013 an elderly Egyptian woman \u2013 as a role model for medieval English Christians.\u00a0\n\"There has never been a full in-depth study of why this legend resonated in England,\" says Alexandra Zhirnova, a Cambridge scholar who is giving a talk on Saint Mary of Egypt on 22 March as part of the Cambridge Festival \u2013 a showcase of the research underway at Cambridge University. \"I want to bring this story into the light, because it dispels a lot of the negative stereotypes that we have heard about the Middle Ages, and how medieval Europeans only have negative perceptions of women, particularly women with darker skin. My talk shines a light on how Mary gets adopted as a saint in England during a time when the Church was very concerned with gender norms and how women ought to behave,\" Zhirnova tells the BBC.\nIn this period, adopting a saint was not a formal eclestiastical process. \"It just involves people worshipping you as a saint and your legend being known to lots of people,\" says Zhirnova. Mary of Egypt, who is said to have lived in 4th-Century Egypt, had already attained the status of a saint across Europe. \"But it was only when the story was translated into Old English that it became accessible to ordinary people in England,\" says Zhirnova.\nZhirnova will argue in her talk that the legend directly challenges commonly held views of what a holy woman should look like, and that it counteracts the misogynistic teachings of men of the time who emphasised passive obedience to the Church, particularly in the case of women, and strict adherence to rules governing how women should conduct themselves sexually.\u00a0\nThe legend is told from the perspective of an arrogant monk who purports to have met Mary in the desert after she has been living there naked for 40 years.\n\"She rejects the world to the point that she stops wearing clothes, because she doesn't need them,\" says Zhirnova. She then becomes \"like a priest\" to the monk, explaining to him what's wrong with his relationship with God, and quotes to him from scripture, even though she's never read the Bible. Despite her promiscuity \u2013 she had multiple lovers in her youth, it is revealed in the story \u2013 the monk looks up to her and realises he hasn't understood what a true Christian was before.\u00a0\n\"She's held up as an example of fantastic Christian spirituality,\" Zhirnova notes. Yet at the time, most popular female saints were virgins, who became saints after being persecuted for choosing to stay chaste and devote themselves to God.\nThe existence of Saint Mary \u2013 a sexually experienced, naked, elderly Egyptian woman \u2013 utterly undermines this stereotype. Yet, Zhirnova says, \"the tale suggests this woman, who breaks every single convention that the Church has established for holy women, is a lesson for men on how to be a better Christian.\"\u00a0\nAlthough she is described as having \"blackened\" skin, it is not entirely clear whether or not Saint Mary is black, Zhirnova says.\nThe Old English translation of the tale states she was \"extremely black in her body because of the sun's heat\".\nHowever, medieval readers did not understand or perceive racial differences in the way we do today. \"At that point, they believed that people who have dark skin are dark because they live in places with a lot of sun. So, for example, Ethiopia is a sunny place, therefore people from there have darker skin,\" Zhirnova says.\nWhether or not Saint Mary is black or just tanned may not have been an issue medieval readers were particularly concerned about. \"I truly don't know to what extent it would have been important to them to make a distinction between being born with dark skin and having it due to being outside a lot, but I think certainly they would have thought of her as culturally different,\" Irina Dumitrescu, professor of English Medieval Studies at the University of Bonn, tells the BBC.\nIn her opinion \"what's important about her dark skin is that it demonstrates that the culture of medieval England is a more cosmopolitan culture that many people tend to assume. They have trade that goes wider than people might think, and they're interested in learning and stories from North Africa and the Middle East \u2013 so their imagination encompasses these areas.\"\nShe adds that lighter skin was idealised in women in medieval England and associated with virginity: \"There is often a connection made between brightness of colouring \u2013 blonde hair, for example \u2013 and purity. So Mary's darker skin could be associated with a kind of sexuality. That sense of difference is there.\"\nDumitrescu believes that descriptions of Saint Mary's \"very naughty\" youth may account for some of the legend's popularity among medieval readers. \"It's an extremely sexy story,\" she said. \"There's a lot of erotic detail in it. She talks about going on a boat to the Holy Land from Egypt, and how she taught all the people on the boat unspoken lewd acts. It's a little bit ribald and tantalising.\"\u00a0\nShe thinks another reason this remarkable legend became so popular was because \"it's a very human thing to want to know that God also loves imperfect people\u2026 The Mary of Egypt tale has a very important lesson that you cannot teach with tales of virgin saints \u2013 which is God's grace. The Church has always needed stories of sinners who can be saved.\"\nAt a time when many of the monastic readers and copyists of the story were living out their whole lives enclosed in an institution, the legend of Saint Mary presented \"a very disturbing figure\", according to Dumitrescu, which may be part of her appeal.\nUnlike other tales of saints who went off to the desert to devote themselves to God (an ascetic practice known as desert monasticism), Mary of Egypt does not stay in one place. \"She is quite unusual, because she's not even a hermit in a little cave somewhere. She just wanders the desert. She roams freely. She becomes one with nature. She's naked. She doesn't seem to be a regular person in any way, even in the way hermits are,\" says Dumitrescu. \"She's rogue.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The smutty medieval tales that broke taboos\n\u2022\u00a0Five ways to spot a fake masterpiece\n\u2022\u00a0The wild story of London's all-female criminal gang\nFor devout Christians living \"very regulated\" lives, the idea of an exotic naked woman roaming freely in the desert and communing with God would have been exciting and \"kind of tempting\", Dumitrescu adds. \"She is very much an anti-institutional figure. And I think it's absolutely fascinating to have a vision of this woman who is unlike anything women are told to be, and yet God loves her the most.\"\u00a0\nZhirnova\u2019s research suggests this moral may lie at the heart of the tale's popularity in medieval England. Around the same time the story was translated and began to be circulated, there was a power struggle in the Church that threatened to restrict the freedoms of Christian women who were living in monasteries and had devoted themselves to God.\nBenedictine reformists like the English abbot \u00c6lric of Eynsham were advocating for men and women who worked side by side in monasteries \u2013 often under a female leader \u2013 to be separated. \"There was a long tradition in England at that time of what they called double monasteries, so mixed gender communities. But the reformers said this should not be allowed, because it creates temptation for both men and women,\" said Zhironova.\nThese reformers wanted the visibility of chaste monastic women to be restricted for their own protection, and for these women to be shut away and separated from monastic men. Wise elderly women, who were in positions of power in the monasteries, would be particularly affected. \"Instead of having these prominent positions, they had to be enclosed within the walls of the monastery, and not really allowed to leave,\" says Zhirnova. \"That also restricted a lot of the activities that religious women could be involved with, such as teaching, writing manuscripts and preaching to lay people.\"\nThe legend of Saint Mary of Egypt, known as the Life of Mary, may have been translated or circulated by people who were not in favour of such reforms, Zhirnova believes. \"In this legend, we see a woman who resists standard notions of authority. Women aren't allowed to teach \u2013 but Mary teaches.\"\nSaint Mary also upended standard contemporary notions of female saintly beauty and sexual behaviour, such as those put forward in tales translated by \u00c6lric at the same time that the Life of Mary was translated. \"Whiteness is associated with beauty in this period in medieval England, and a lot of the saints that readers will have heard about have white skin, youth and beauty \u2013 these qualities go hand in hand,\" says Zhirnova.\nThat tells us medieval people in England were open to models of sanctity that weren't white, young and obedient.\u00a0\n\"One of the key things about Mary is that she resists this almost objectification of female sanctity. She is purposefully not fitting this standard. And I think her dark skin fits into that and is part of her image as rejecting all of the other expectations of holy women.\"\nZhirnova hopes that her study will do what the Life of Mary did in 11th-Century England and make people more aware of Saint Mary, and her way of being a \"pious Christian\". Just as Saint Mary defied religious establishment norms, the story suggests, so \"she has more spiritual authority than the virginal man she teaches,\" says Zhirnova. \"She's a rebellious saint.\"\nZhirnova also hopes her study will challenge some of the stereotypes about England in the Middle Ages that are perpetuated by the far right. \"Many people on the far right use the Middle Ages as an example of a time when everybody was white and everybody praised white skin as the ideal,\" says Zhirnova. \"In the life of Mary, we see a saint who does not adhere to medieval conceptions of Christian piety as white. That tells us medieval people in England were open to models of sanctity that weren\"t white, young and obedient. They were open to the otherness of Mary.\"\u00a0\nMary of Egypt: A Black Saint in Anglo-Saxon England?, a free talk by Alexandra Zhirnova about her research, will take place at 4.15pm on 22\u00a0March during the Cambridge Festival, along with hundreds of other talks about the world-leading research happening at Cambridge.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The boss of online clothing brand Snag has told the BBC it gets more than 100 complaints a day that the models in its adverts are \"too fat\".\nChief executive Brigitte Read says models of her size 4-38 clothing are frequently the target of \"hateful\" posts about their weight.\nThe brand was cited in an online debate over whether adverts showing \"unhealthily fat\" models should be banned after a Next advert, in which a model appeared \"unhealthily thin\", was banned.\nThe UK's advertising watchdog says it has banned ads using models who appear unhealthily underweight rather than overweight due to society's aspiration towards thinness.\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 61 complaints about models' weight in 2024, with the vast majority being about models who appeared to be too thin.\nBut it only had grounds to investigate eight complaints and none were about Snag.\nCatherine Thom read the BBC report about the Next advert ban and got in touch to say she found it \"hypocritical to ban adverts where models appear too thin for being socially irresponsible, however when models are clearly obese we're saying it's body positivity\".\nThe 36-year-old from Edinburgh was one of several people who contacted the BBC with this view, while a Reddit thread had more than 1,000 comments with many along the same theme.\nMrs Thom says she was \"bombarded with images of obese girls in tights\" after buying from Snag when she was pregnant.\n\"I see Snag tights plastering these morbidly obese people all over social media,\" she says. \n\"How is that allowed when the photo of the Next model isn't? There should be fairness, not politically correct body positivity. Adverts normalising an unhealthy weight, be it obese or severely underweight, are equally as harmful.\"\nBut Snag founder Ms Read says: \"Shaming fat people does not help them to lose weight and actually it really impacts mental health and therefore their physical health.\"\nShe thinks the idea of banning adverts showing models with bigger bodies is a symptom of society's \"fat phobia\".\nOf her 100 staff, 12 are dedicated \"just to remove negative comments and big up those promoting body positivity\".\n\"Fat people exist, they're equally as valid as thin people, they buy clothes and they need to see what they look like on people that look like them,\" she says.\n\"You are not worth less the bigger you are. Models of all sizes, shapes, ethnicities and abilities are valid and should be represented.\"\nSophie Scott is a 27-year-old salon owner from Lossiemouth in Scotland who has modelled for Snag, and received positive and negative comments about her size on social media.\n\"I get either 'you're so beautiful' or 'you need to lose weight'. When I started modelling I was a size 30. Having lost weight since then I'm still on the receiving end of hate comments because it will never be enough for some people.\"\nSophie is used to online comments telling her she is \"unhealthy\", but says, \"fitness is not measured by the way you look. They are making assumptions, they don't know me or my activity levels.\n\"People say 'you're glorifying obesity' but I don't think anyone is looking at me and saying 'I want to look like that'. Perhaps some people are looking at me and saying 'she has a similar body type to me'.\n\"When I get a message from someone saying 'we are the same size and you've inspired me to wear what I want', it takes away from every hate comment I get.\n\"If I've helped one person accept their body then the hate comments don't really bother me.\"\nFashion journalist Victoria Moss believes the \"depressing\" debate shows society is not used to seeing bigger bodies in advertising campaigns.\n\"You'd be pretty hard pushed to find genuine plus-size models on retailers' websites because even a mid-size is a 10/12 and plus is 14/16 which is actually around the average size for a woman in the UK,\" she says.\n\"The issue with adverts showing very small or very big models is the context and the provocation. We know people with eating disorders seek out images of very thin people as 'thinspiration'. But if anyone sees a picture of a bigger person they're not going to drive to buy 10 McDonald's to try to get fatter.\"\nJess Tye at the ASA told the BBC the watchdog gets about 35,000 complaints a year about all advertising, and in 2024 received 61 complaints about 52 adverts relating to the model's weight.\nShe says an advert will be investigated if it could be seen to be encouraging people to aspire to an unhealthy body weight.

        "summary": "Clothes brand gets 100 complaints a day that models are 'too fat'3 days agoShareSaveJennifer MeierhansBusiness reporter, BBC NewsShareSaveSnagSophie models for Snag and gets positive and negative comments about her weightListen to Jennifer read this article The boss of online clothing brand Snag has told the BBC it gets more than 100 complaints a day that the models in its adverts are \"too fat\".Chief executive Brigitte Read says models of her size 4-38 clothing are frequently the target of \"hateful\" posts about their weight.The brand was cited in an online debate over whether adverts showing \"unhealthily fat\" models should be banned after a Next advert, in which a model appeared \"unhealthily thin\", was banned.The UK's advertising watchdog says it has banned ads using models who appear unhealthily underweight rather than overweight due to society's aspiration towards thinness.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 61 complaints about models' weight in 2024, with the vast majority being about models who appeared to be too thin.But it only had grounds to investigate eight complaints and none were about Snag.Catherine Thom read the BBC report about the Next advert ban and got in touch to say she found it \"hypocritical to ban adverts where models appear too thin for being socially irresponsible, however when models are clearly obese we're saying it's body positivity\".Catherine ThomAdverts should not normalise being extremely under or overweight, says CatherineThe 36-year-old from Edinburgh was one of several people who contacted the BBC with this view, while a Reddit thread had more than 1,000 comments with many along the same theme.Mrs Thom says she was \"bombarded with images of obese girls in tights\" after buying from Snag when she was pregnant. \"Fat people exist, they're equally as valid as thin people, they buy clothes and they need to see what they look like on people that look like them,\" she says. \"Sophie Scott is a 27-year-old salon owner from Lossiemouth in Scotland who has modelled for Snag, and received positive and negative comments about her size on social media.Sophie ScottSophie says if she helps one person to accept their body then the hateful comments don't bother her\"I get either 'you're so beautiful' or 'you need to lose weight'. \"She thinks the idea of banning adverts showing models with bigger bodies is a symptom of society's \"fat phobia\".Of her 100 staff, 12 are dedicated \"just to remove negative comments and big up those promoting body positivity\". \"Jess Tye at the ASA told the BBC the watchdog gets about 35,000 complaints a year about all advertising, and in 2024 received 61 complaints about 52 adverts relating to the model's weight.She says an advert will be investigated if it could be seen to be encouraging people to aspire to an unhealthy body weight.",

        "article_text": "England head coach Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate - and it is a selection that is already prompting wide debate.\nTuchel has recalled former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, who is 35 in June, while Marcus Rashford is rewarded with a return to the squad for his fine form on loan at Aston Villa from Manchester United.\nHe has also revealed first picks at either end of the age scale from Arsenal's 18-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly to 32-year-old Newcastle United defender Dan Burn for the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia at Wembley next Friday (21 March) and Monday (24 March) respectively.\nSo what can be unpicked from Tuchel's first indication of England's future direction?\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nReaction, analysis & your views on Tuchel\u2019s first England squad\nPick your England XI for World Cup qualifiers - and fans have their say\nTuchel's appointment as England head coach has always carried the feel of an 18-month job focussed entirely on winning the World Cup and not beyond.\nWin then move on. Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park.

He was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'Watch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squadHenderson embodies everything we try to build - TuchelPublished7 hours agoTuchel's England will get physicalTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.Burn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.Tuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.England exiles in from the coldThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.Henderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.The former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.Tuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He is included in Carsley's England Under-21 side.Tottenham defender Djed Spence will have had his backers, while there is no place for Conor Gallagher despite his fine form at Atletico Madrid.Tuchel resisted the temptation to include Arsenal 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, who also goes into Carsley's squad.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, How Grealish needs 'confidence and love'Charismatic Tuchel looks a comfortable fitThomas Tuchel gave a hugely impressive performance in front of the media after announcing his first squad.From suggestion he is intent on \"building a brotherhood\" in his England squad to talking about \"a parental vibe\" when handling Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tuchel was confident and comfortable in his new skin as England head coach.No subject was off limits, apart from when he declined to reveal who his captain might be if Harry Kane was not available.Tuchel was open, honest and clearly excited about the task ahead, although he admitted he was \"missing the smell of the grass\" and could not wait to get on the training ground with his new charges.This is a coach who has been around the block with big clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Paris St. Germain and Bayern Munich, while getting a feel and admiration for the English game and his players at Chelsea.He is the quick winner the FA wanted with his appointment.Now the serious work starts with the World Cup his goal.The Team Selector cannot be displayed in your browser. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.There is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.However, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now.",

In total, 155 were injured at the concert.\nBiljana Arsovska said short-term detentions had been issued for 10 suspects believed to be responsible for the fire - including \"officials from the ministries which gave out this licence\".\nInterior Minister Pance Toskovski said on Sunday afternoon the venue did not have a legal licence to operate, while police are looking into whether bribery and corruption were linked to the fire are under way.\nThe venue, in a town around 100km (60 miles) east of the capital, Skopje, has been described as an \"improvised nightclub\" in the local press, having previously been a carpet warehouse.\nMs Arsovska said there had been only \"one efficient exit\" in the building, as the venue's back door was locked and could not be used. \nThe first on-site inspections on Sunday had also showed several \"abnormalities\" in the venue. \"There are deficiencies in the system for fire-extinguishing and the system for lightning,\" she said.\nCiting initial reports, Toskovski said the fire had been started by sparks from pyrotechnic devices that had hit the ceiling, which was made of highly flammable material.\nFootage shows the band - which formed in 2002 and has topped the North Macedonian charts over the past decade - playing on stage when two flares go off, after which sparks catch fire on the ceiling before spreading rapidly. \nVideo verified by the BBC shows people trying to extinguish the flames on the ceiling. The footage shows the club was still full and some people appeared to be watching efforts to put out the fire rather than leaving.\nReports suggest the fact there was only a single entry and exit point to the improvised nightclub caused panic.\nMarija Taseva, 20, told Channel 5 TV she was caught in a crush at the club as people rushed for the exits. She recalled falling to the ground and being trampled during the chaos before managing to get out.\n\"I don't know how, but somehow I managed to get out,\" she told the Reuters news agency. \"I'm fine now, but there are many dead.\"\nShe added that her 25-year-old sister - who her family had previously been searching for - had died, saying: \"I was saved and she wasn't.\"\nRed Cross volunteer Mustafa Saidov said most of those affected were young people aged 18 to 20.  Officials say more than 20 of the injured and three of those killed were under 18.\n\"The situation is brutal, chaotic, the stories are very sad, and unfortunately many young lives are lost,\" Mr Saidov added.\nDr Vladislav Gruev, a specialist in reconstructive and plastic surgery at the University Clinic for Surgical Diseases in the capital, told the BBC most of the patients being treated at his hospital arrived with extensive burns.\n\"[They have] second and third degree burns in the head, neck and upper torso,\" he said.\nKocani's hospital director earlier said that staff had initially been struggling to identify patients due to a lack of ID cards. Eighteen patients were assessed as being in a critical condition.\nPrime Minister Hristijan Mickoski called it a \"difficult and very sad day\" for the country, which had lost many \"young lives\".\nThe government has declared seven days of national mourning, and the government is holding an emergency session as part of ongoing investigations on how the incident unfolded.\nNorth Macedonia's President, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, said she was shocked \"as a mother, as a person, as a president\". Addressing the bereaved directly, she added: \"Your immense pain is mine too.\"\n\"No business or activity can function without standards and rules,\" she wrote in a statement. \"Let us not allow anyone to endanger the lives of innocent people again.\"\nSiljanovska-Davkova added that the most seriously injured were being taken to received treatment in specialist clinics in Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey. \nEuropean leaders have voiced their condolences, with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen saying the EU \"stands in solidarity with the people of North Macedonia in this difficult time\".\nNeighbouring Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic called it \"a tragedy of immense magnitude\", adding that fears remain as \"many more people will not be able to withstand the level of injuries they have at this moment\".\nAdditional reporting by Richard Irvine-Brown\nHave you been affected by the nightclub fire in North Macedonia?

In January this year, the ESA calculated the rock's trajectory and initially predicted that there was a 1.2% chance of impact with Earth on 22 December 2032.\nThis officially crossed the comfortable threshold of risk for a near-Earth object \u2013 1% \u2013 and triggered the need for investigation by several planetary defence organisations, as well as the US President and US Congress.\u00a0\nLuckily YR4 is not large enough to be capable of making our species extinct but it could still be a \"city killer\", according to some experts, if it is at the upper end of the estimated size range and landed in a heavily populated area.\u00a0\nIn February 2025, the risk of the asteroid hitting the Earth briefly climbed to 3.1% or one in 32. Luckily, humanity managed to avoid mass panic and the risk has since reduced to a more reassuring 0.001%. But where did this asteroid come from in the first place? And how concerned should we be about a similar scenario emerging in the future?\u00a0\nWhen it comes to understanding asteroids, astronomers and scientists are still being dealt the cards in order to understand the rules of this potentially risky celestial game.\n\"Scientifically there's a huge amount we can learn from asteroids,\" says Alan Fitzsimmons, an astronomer at Queens University Belfast and a member of one of Nasa's sky surveys that searches and tracks Near Earth Objects (NEOs). These are asteroids whose orbit brings them within 195 million km (121 million miles) of the Sun.\n\"Any asteroid we detect is generally a fragment of a much larger body that was formed at the birth of our Solar System\" says Fitzsimmons. \"So by studying their chemical make-up we get some idea of the conditions in the initial Solar System as since then, over 4.6 billion years, it has evolved dynamically.\"\u00a0\nThese ancient rocky remnants are sometimes referred to as minor planets. Often irregular and cratered, they can also be spherical. They can spin slow, fast or tumble. Usually solitary, they can sometimes be found in pairs (binary or double asteroids) and some even have their own moon. Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's website keeps tabs on their numbers and at the last count there are over 1.4 million in our Solar System. The majority are located within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter but millions more are too small to be detected.\u00a0\nMost of the time these asteroids remain restrained within that interplanetary belt by Jupiter's gravitational field, unable to coalesce into a larger body. But occasionally another asteroid or the influence of Jupiter's gravity can nudge some into another orbit around the Sun, towards the inner Solar System.\nOnce an asteroid has been ejected from its usual path and is potentially heading our way, the first challenge is to detect it.\u00a0\n\"All an asteroid looks like in a telescope is a point of light against other points of lights that are stars, except it's moving,\" says Kelly Fast, Nasa's acting planetary defence officer, \"and it's reflecting sunlight.\"\nThe brighter the asteroid, the bigger it will be. But its colour also affects the brightness as a small white asteroid might reflect more light than a much larger dark one. It's not an exact science, which is why YR4's size is estimated at 40-90m (131-295ft) wide. The more information we have, however, the more precise that number will become.\n\"A team at Nasa and an ESA team will be using the James Webb Space Telescope to take infrared observations of YR4,\" says Fast. These measurements of an asteroid's thermal emissions \"may be helpful for constraining that size range\", she adds.\nYR4, in common with most asteroids,\u00a0is from the asteroid belt. \"Which part of the belt is hard to tell,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"One clue that we have is a spectrum of its surface.\" By examining the intensity of light emitted over a range of wavelengths, specific materials on the surface of the asteroid can be identified. \"YR4 is a rocky asteroid that's deficient in lighter elements such as carbon, which tells us that it probably came from the inner asteroid belt,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"But exactly where we don't know \u2013 and we may never know.\"\nAsteroids are not all the same either. \"There are different populations,\" says Fast. \"Some are stony, some are carbonaceous and some have metallic content depending on the parent bodies they came from.\"\nWhile there are rare types of asteroids, more than three out of four are carbonaceous, or C-type, and contain carbon, appearing black as coal. The rest are mostly S-type or silicaceous \u2013 a mix of metal and silicate crystals \u2013 or metallic or M-type asteroids, which contain predominantly iron and nickel.\u00a0\nOne asteroid scientists are particularly interested in is\u00a0 \u2013 a large, metal-rich rock the shape of a potato, which inhabits the Solar System's main asteroid belt. It's thought this asteroid could be up to 95% nickel and iron, which is similar to the Earth's core. Studying it will therefore increase our understanding of how our own planet formed. Nasa's Psyche mission is currently on its way there and is due to arrive in August 2029.\nIn terms of metal content, asteroids like Psyche 16 are also potentially extremely valuable \u2013 it's thought to contain resources worth approximately US$10 quadrillion (\u00a37.8 quadrillion). In the future, if asteroid mining ever became necessary as well as economically and technically feasible, it's thought they could provide an abundance of resources.\nKnowing an asteroid's composition is key for defence reasons too. An iron-rich asteroid, for example would do more damage on impact than carbonaceous ones as it is more dense, has more mass and would have more energy if it smashed into a moon or planet. The Earth's Moon, as can be seen, is littered by asteroid impact craters since it only has a thin atmosphere, or exosphere, which cannot protective it. Although the Earth is unlikely to receive an impact by YR4, there remains a 1.7% chance it could hit our Moon.\nThe level of damage also depends on the asteroid's structure. \"If you know more about the structure of these objects,\" says Fitzsimmons, \"then you can calculate more accurately what happens when it hits the Earth's atmosphere.Most asteroids below 10km [6.2 miles] across are almost all either heavily fractured solid objects or rock piles \u2013 smaller fragments of asteroids grouped together mostly by gravity.\"\nDoes this mean a rubble pile asteroid would be more likely to burn up in the atmosphere and therefore be less dangerous? \"Unfortunately not,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"If an asteroid is hitting the Earth at 17km per second (over 38,000 mph), it's in the atmosphere for less than 10 seconds before it reaches impact.\"\nWhile the Earth's atmosphere acts as a protective barrier, that still doesn't prevent all damage. \"Something the size of YR4 would probably only make it to a few kilometres above the Earth's surface. It will lose its energy and explode at altitude. Although we wouldn't get a crater, we would have an air blast and that could be just as devastating as if it hit the ground,\" says Fitzsimmons.\u00a0\nAt the moment we don't know if YR4 is one solid object or whether it's a rock pile, but an air blast could have been significant considering what happened in 2013. A fireball \u2013 which is what an asteroid is called once it enters Earth's atmosphere \u2013 exploded about 14 miles (22.5km) above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia. Eyewitnesses described the light as brighter than the Sun, and the blast's shockwave damaged over 4,000 buildings and injured 1,200 people.\n\"The asteroid was around 20m (66ft) in size,\" says K\u00fcppers. \"This is maybe about the limit size where you would start worrying if it hits populated areas.\"\nCoincidentally, on the day of the Chelyabinsk event, a United Nations committee was underway in Vienna about defending Earth from future asteroid impacts. The meeting resulted in the International Asteroid Warning Network, chaired by Nasa, and a Space Missions Planning Advisory Group for space agencies around the world to collaborate.\nFortunately, there have already been a number of missions which have studied asteroids, starting with Galileo when it flew past two asteroids in the early 1990s. In 2000, Nasa's Near Shoemaker became the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid, Eros, and \u2013 a year later \u2013 to land on one too. The Japanese Huyabusa 2 mission visited the C-type asteroid 162173\u00a0Ryugu in 2018 and 2019 and even sent back a sample to Earth in a hermetically sealed container in 2005.\nThe US OSIRIS-REx mission (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security\u2013Regolith Explorer) collected dust and rocks from asteroid Bennu and returned them to Earth in 2023. Earlier this year, the first in-depth analysis of the samples' minerals and molecules were published. It included finding 14 of the 20 amino acids used by life to make proteins on Earth. The spacecraft, renamed OSIRIS-APEX, is now on its way to explore asteroid Apophis.\u00a0\nAll these missions, and more, have allowed scientists to study the composition and particle size of several asteroids, as well as the magnetic properties of samples to inform our understanding of the Solar System's early magnetic field. But there is another reason for studying asteroids, brought home by the concerns over YR4: to protect our planet.\nIn 2022, Nasa's Dart (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission deliberately aimed itself at a harmless \u2013 from the Earth's point of view \u2013 binary asteroid system consisting of asteroid Didymos (780m, or 2,559 ft) and its smaller orbiting asteroid or moonlet, Dimorphos (160m, or 525ft). The spacecraft used itself as a kinetic impactor, targeting Dimorphos at around 22,530km (14,000 miles) per hour. This was Nasa's first test to see if it could deflect an asteroid's path and it was a success. After impact, Dimorphos' orbit was altered. Does this mean, in future, that Nasa asteroid missions will focus on planetary defence rather than understanding more about the science?\u00a0\n\"We're very much interested in both,\" says Fast, \"and it's a really good partnership. The planetary defence coordination office at Nasa sits inside of the planetary science division because there is so much asteroid science involved in it. We want to protect the planet but we also want to study these amazing leftovers from the formation of the Solar System, both to understand the history of the Solar System and to see what the effects might be should they impact, or should we need to deflect one in space.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "We are surrounded by an invisible killer. One so common that we barely notice it shortening our lives.\nIt's causing heart attacks, type 2 diabetes and studies now even link it to dementia.\nWhat do you think it could be?\nThe answer is noise - and its impact on the human body goes far beyond damaging hearing.\n\"It is a public health crisis, we've got huge numbers of people exposed in their everyday life,\" says Prof Charlotte Clark, from St George's, University of London.\nIt's just a crisis we don't talk about.\nSo I've been investigating when noise becomes dangerous, chatting to the people whose health is suffering and seeing if there's any way of overcoming our noisy world.\nI started by meeting Prof Clark in an eerily silent sound laboratory. We're going to see how my body reacts to noise and I've been kitted out with a device that looks like a chunky smartwatch.\nIt's going to measure my heart rate and how much my skin sweats.\nYou can join in too if you have some headphones. Think about how these five sounds make you feel.\nThe one I find really grating is the traffic noise from Dhaka, Bangladesh, which has the title of the noisiest city in the world. I immediately feel like I'm in a ginormous, stressful traffic jam.\nAnd the sensors are picking up my agitation - my heart rate shoots up and my skin is sweating more.\n\"There's really good evidence that traffic noise affects your heart health,\" says Prof Clark, as the next sound is prepared.\nOnly the joyful sounds of the playground have a calming effect on my body. The dogs barking and the neighbour's party in the early hours lead to a negative response.\nBut why is sound changing my body?\n\"You have an emotional response to sound,\" says Prof Clark.\nSound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region \u2013 the amygdala \u2013 performs the emotional assessment.\nThis is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes.\n\"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me.\nAll of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage.\n\"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark.\nInsidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story.\n\"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark.\nNoise is unwanted sound. Transport - traffic, trains and aeroplanes \u2013 are a major source, but so too are the sounds of us having a good time. One person's great party is another's insufferable noise.\nI meet Coco at her fourth-floor flat in the historic Vila de Gr\u00e0cia area of Barcelona, Spain.\nThere's a bag of freshly picked lemons tied to her door gifted by one neighbour, her fridge contains a tortilla cooked by another and she offers me fancy cakes made by a third neighbour who's training in patisserie.\nFrom the balcony you can see the city's famous cathedral, the Sagrada Familia. It is easy to see why Coco has fallen in love with living here, but it comes at a huge price and she thinks she'll be forced to leave.\n\"It's extremely noisy\u2026 it's 24-hour noise,\" she tells me. There's a dog park for owners to walk their pooches which \"bark at 2, 3, 4, 5am\" and the courtyard is a public space that is used for everything from children's birthday parties to all-day concerts finished off with fireworks.\nShe gets out her phone and plays the recordings of the music being blasted out so loud it makes the glass in her windows vibrate.\nHer home should be a refuge from the stress of work, but the noise \"brings frustration, I feel like crying\".\nShe has been \"hospitalised twice with chest pain\" and \"absolutely\" thinks noise is causing the stress, which is damaging her health. \"There is a physical change that I feel, it does something to your body, for certain,\" she says.\nIn Barcelona there are an estimated 300 heart attacks and 30 deaths a year just from traffic noise, according to researcher Dr Maria Foraster, who has reviewed evidence on noise for the World Health Organization.\nAcross Europe noise is linked to 12,000 early deaths a year as well as millions of cases of severely disturbed sleep as well as serious noise annoyance which can impact mental health.\nI meet Dr Foraster at a caf\u00e9 that is separated from one of Barcelona's busiest roads by a small park. My sound meter says the noise from the distant traffic is just over 60 decibels here.\nWe can easily chat over the noise without raising our voices, but this is already an unhealthy volume.\nThe crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks.\n\"This 53 means that we need to be in a rather quiet environment,\" says Dr Foraster.\nAnd that's just in daytime, we need even lower levels for sleep. \"At night we need quietness,\" she says.\nAlthough it is not just about the volume, how disruptive the sound is and how much control you have over it affect our emotional response to noise.\nDr Foraster argues the health impact of noise is \"at the level of air pollution\" but is much harder to comprehend.\n\"We are used to understanding that chemicals can affect health and they are toxic, but it's not so straightforward to understand that a physical factor, like noise, affects our health beyond our hearing,\" she says.\nA loud party can be the fun that makes life worth living and someone else's intolerable noise.\nThe sound of traffic has the greatest impact on health because so many people are exposed to it. But traffic is also the sound of getting to work, doing the shopping and taking the children to school. Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own.\nDr Natalie Mueller, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, takes me for a walk around the city centre. We start on a busy road \u2013 my sound meter clocks in at over 80 decibels \u2013 and we head to a quiet tree-lined avenue where the noise is down to the 50s.\nBut there is something different about this street \u2013 it used to be a busy road, but the space was given over to pedestrians, cafes and gardens. I can see the ghost of an old cross roads by the shape of the flowerbeds. Vehicles can still come down here, just slowly.\nRemember earlier in the lab, we found that some sounds can soothe the body.\n\"It is not completely silent, but it's a different perception of sound and noise,\" Dr Mueller says. My heart rate went down and I stopped sweating.\nThe initial plan was to create more than 500 areas like this, termed \"superblocks\" - pedestrian-friendly areas created by grouping several city blocks together.\nDr Mueller performed the research projecting a 5-10% reduction in noise in the city, which would prevent about \"150 premature deaths\" from noise alone each year. And that would be \"just the tip of the iceberg\" of the health benefits.\nBut in reality only six superblocks were ever built. The city council declined to comment.\nThe dangers of noise though are continuing to grow. Urbanisation is putting more people into noisy cities.\nDhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. This has brought more traffic and given the city a cacophonous soundtrack of honking horns.\nArtist Momina Raman Royal earned the label of the \"lone hero\" as his silent protests have focused attention on the city's noise problem.\nFor about 10 minutes each day, he stands at the intersection of a couple of busy roads with a big yellow placard accusing drivers who honk their horns loudly of causing a massive nuisance.\nHe took on the mission after his daughter was born. \"I want to stop all honking from not only Dhaka, but from Bangladesh,\" he says.\n\"If you see the birds or trees or rivers, no one's making noise without humans, so humans are responsible.\"\nBut here there are the beginnings of political action too. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who's the environment adviser and minister for the government of Bangladesh, told me she was \"very worried\" about the health impacts of noise.\nThere is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws.\nShe said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\"\nThe solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve.\nWhat I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".\nLOUD was produced by Gerry Holt.

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

He learned how to take care of himself and \"become a better man\".\n\"Now they are supporting me to join the Army,\" he adds. \"They've bought me the kit and helped me meet the right people. It's a career path I wouldn't even have looked into but I'm really excited by it.\"\nSonia Shaljean, who runs the organisation, says she knew Harley had huge potential, even though he was \"quite shut down\" when he joined them.\nShe believes fatherlessness is a key factor in issues from crime and addiction to school exclusions, homelessness and male suicide.\n\"It's not taken seriously enough,\" she says. \"We skirt around the issue, and it's almost controversial to say it, but boys need a supportive father figure.\n\"Some people are offended by our name - Lads Need Dads - but I stand by it. We're not taking away from the importance of a mother, but that male influence is also important.\n\"Ultimately, we're helping women and girls too by raising boys who are more emotionally intelligent, stable and secure.\"\nSource: CSJ - a Conservative think-tank focused on tackling poverty.\nSonia, who is a mother of three young men, says some boys who have grown up in violent homes can be fearful of men, so positive male role models are crucial.\n\"We work with them in the same group for up to eight years, so they build real friendships and it becomes like a family.\n\"Our groups are incredibly diverse. It's a misconception that father absence is just an issue in certain communities.\"\nNot all fathers are absent by choice, she says.\n\"Some were wonderful dads but have sadly passed away. Some boys have been abandoned by their fathers but others desperately want to be involved in their sons' lives and some even struggle with suicidal thoughts as a result.\"\nAround the eight-month mark of the programme, boys often start to talk about their fathers, she says.\n\"As their confidence grows, some feel ready to explore the possibility of reconnecting and many go on to re-establish a relationship with their dads.\"\nSonia set up Lads Need Dads 10 years ago, with an initial grant of \u00a34,000, having worked for more than 20 years on the frontlines of criminal justice, addiction, domestic abuse and homelessness.\n\"I kept seeing the same heartbreaking pattern - so many men stuck in cycles of crime, addiction, and hopelessness. And nearly every time, there was one thing they had in common: growing up without a father or a positive male role model.\n\"I thought 'I've got to do something'. If we don't provide a service for these boys we won't break this cycle,\" she says.\nAbout 250 boys have been helped by the organisation. \nCharlie Howlett, 19, says it saved his life when he joined six years ago.\nHis mother had died when he was a two, leaving his father to bring him and his younger brother up alone.\n\"My dad didn't take it too well and it wasn't the best situation growing up,\" he adds.\nThe brothers moved in with their nan and aunt a few years later, but still remained close to their dad until he died suddenly from a blood clot when Charlie was 12.\nCharlie tried to be strong for everyone and be the father figure. \"But I couldn't cope,\" he says. \"I was lashing out at everyone and started thinking about taking my own life.\"\nLads Need Dads has given him an \"unimaginable\" amount of support, he says.\n\"I thought I was the only person going through it, then I met this group of boys my age who were also growing up without a dad.\n\"The mentors were a huge part of it for me. You grow to trust them like your own dad.\"\nSonia and her team supported Charlie three years ago when his nan, who he was still living with, also died.\n\"They have helped me be a better big brother and I think that has kept him on a good path too,\" he adds.\nSonia helped Charlie get a plumbing apprenticeship and, for the last year, he has also been mentoring boys on the programme.\n\"It's a really good feeling to know I'm giving something back. I can see parts of myself in all of them,\" he says.\nLads Need Dads also runs a reading mentor programme in primary schools and is piloting a new programme in September where, for the first time, male teachers will deliver a three-month intervention to Year 7 boys.\nDespite its impact, Sonia says Lads Need Dads is struggling for funding.\n\"It's so frustrating because I feel like we have this blueprint that works that could be rolled out nationwide, but I have to turn away mothers who don't live in Essex, who are desperate for help for their sons.\"\nSonia says society has to believe in boys like Harley and Charlie, and help them reach their potential and break the cycle of fatherlessness.\nAs for Charlie, he says he wants to carry on plumbing, see more of the world and continue mentoring boys. But his ultimate wish is to be a father.\n\"I can't wait to be a dad. It's the one thing in my life I know is exactly what I want.

        "article_text": "England head coach Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate - and it is a selection that is already prompting wide debate.\nTuchel has recalled former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, who is 35 in June, while Marcus Rashford is rewarded with a return to the squad for his fine form on loan at Aston Villa from Manchester United.\nHe has also revealed first picks at either end of the age scale from Arsenal's 18-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly to 32-year-old Newcastle United defender Dan Burn for the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia at Wembley next Friday (21 March) and Monday (24 March) respectively.\nSo what can be unpicked from Tuchel's first indication of England's future direction?\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nReaction, analysis & your views on Tuchel\u2019s first England squad\nPick your England XI for World Cup qualifiers - and fans have their say\nTuchel's appointment as England head coach has always carried the feel of an 18-month job focussed entirely on winning the World Cup and not beyond.\nWin then move on. Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy.

Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.Tuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.England exiles in from the coldThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.Henderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.The former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.Tuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'Watch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squadHenderson embodies everything we try to build - TuchelPublished23 hours agoTuchel's England will get physicalTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.Burn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running.

        "article_text": "After Kim Visintine put her son to bed every night at a hospital in St Louis, Missouri, she spent her evening in the hospital\u2019s library. She was determined to know how her boy had become seriously ill with a rare brain tumour at just a week old.\n\"Doctors were shocked,\" she says. \"We were told that his illness was one in a million. Other parents were learning to change diapers but I was learning how to change chemotherapy ports and IVs.\"\nKim\u2019s son Zack was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme. It is a brain tumour that is very rare in children and is usually seen in adults over 45. \nZack had chemotherapy treatments but doctors said there was no hope of him ever recovering. He died at just six years old.\nYears later, social media and community chatter made Kim start to think that her son was not an isolated case. Perhaps he was part of a bigger picture growing in their community surrounding Coldwater Creek.\nIn this part of the US, cancer fears have prompted locals to accuse officials of not doing enough to support those who may have been exposed to radiation due to the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s. \nA compensation programme that was designed to pay out to some Americans who contracted diseases after exposure to radiation expired last year - before it could be extended to the St Louis area. \nThis Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Reca) provided one-time payouts to people who may have developed cancer or other diseases while living in areas where activities such as atomic weapons testing took place. It paid out $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) to more than 41,000 claimants before coming to an end in 2024.\nBenefits were paid to such neighbours, frequently called \"downwinders\", in Arizona, Utah and Nevada, but not New Mexico, where the world's first test of a nuclear weapon took place in 1945. Research published in 2020 by the National Cancer Institute suggested that hundreds of cancers in the area would not have occurred without radiation exposure.\nSt Louis, meanwhile, was where uranium was refined and used to help create the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. After World War Two ended, the chemical was dumped near the creek and left uncovered, allowing waste to seep into the area.\nDecades later, federal investigators acknowledged an increased cancer risk for some people who played in the creek as children, but added in their report: \"The predicted increases in the number of cancer cases from exposures are small, and no method exists to link a particular cancer with this exposure.\"\nThe clean-up of the creek is still ongoing and is not expected to finish until 2038.\nA new bill has been put forward in the House, and Josh Hawley, a US senator representing Missouri, says he has raised the issue with President Donald Trump. \nWhen Kim flicks through her school yearbook, she can identify those who have become sick and those who have since passed away. The numbers are startling.\n\"My husband didn\u2019t grow up in this area, and he said to me, 'Kim, this is not normal. It seems like we\u2019re always talking about one of your friends passing away or going to a funeral',\" she says.\nJust streets away from the creek, Karen Nickel grew up spending her days near the water picking berries, or in the nearby park playing baseball. Her brother would often try and catch fish in Coldwater Creek.\n\"I always tell people that we had just the fairytale childhood that you would expect in what you consider suburban America,\" says Karen. \"Big backyards, big families, children playing out together until the street lights came on at night.\"\nBut years later, her carefree childhood now looks very different.\n\"Fifteen people from the street I grew up on have died from rare cancers,\" she says. \"We have neighbourhoods here where every house has been affected by some cancer or some illness. We have streets where you can\u2019t just find a house where a family has not been affected by this.\"\nWhen Karen\u2019s sister was just 11 years old, doctors discovered that her ovaries were covered in cysts. The same had happened to their neighbour when she was just nine. Karen\u2019s six-year-old granddaughter was born with a mass on her right ovary.\nKaren helped found Just Moms STL, a group that is dedicated to protecting the community from future exposures that could be linked to cancers - and which advocates for a clean-up of the area.\n\"We get messages every day from people that are suffering from illnesses and are questioning whether this is from exposure,\" she says. \"These are very aggressive illnesses that the community is getting, from cancers all the way to autoimmune diseases.\"\nTeresa Rumfelt grew up just a street away from Karen and lived in her family home from 1979 until 2010. She remembers every one of her animals passing away from cancer and her neighbours getting ill from rare diseases.\nYears later, her sister Via Von Banks was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease. Some medical studies have suggested there could be a link between radiation and ALS, but this is not definitive - and more research needs to be done to firm it up. \nThat does not reassure people like Teresa who are concerned that more needs to be done to understand how locals are being affected. \n\"ALS took my sister at 50,\" Teresa says. \"I think it was the worst disease ever of mankind. When she was diagnosed in 2019, she\u2019d just got her career going and her children were growing. She stayed positive through all of it.\"\nLike Hawley, Just STL Moms and other community members want the government's compensation act to be expanded to include people within the St Louis area, despite the programme being in limbo after expiring.\nExpanding it to the Coldwater Creek community would mean that locals could be offered compensation if they could prove they were harmed as a result of the Manhattan Project, during which the atomic bomb was developed with the help of uranium-processing in St Louis. It would also allow screenings and further study into illnesses other than cancer. \nIn a statement to the BBC, the US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it took concerns very seriously and had actively worked with federal, state and local partners - as well as community members - to understand their health concerns, and to ensure community members were not exposed to the Manhattan Project-era waste.\nThe BBC has also contacted the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is leading the clean-up - but has not received a response to a request for comment.\n\"My sister would have loved to be part of the fight. She\u2019d be the first to picket,\" says Teresa of her efforts to get greater support from the government.\nThe trend in people around Coldwater Creek getting unwell has not gone unnoticed among healthcare professionals.\nDr Gautum Agarwal, a cancer surgeon at Mercy Hospital in St Louis, says he has not noticed a \"statistical thing\", but notes that he has seen husbands and wives and their neighbours presenting cancers.\nNow, he ensures that his patients are asked where they live and how close they are to Coldwater Creek.\n\"I tell them that there\u2019s a potential that there\u2019s a link. And if your neighbours or family live near there, we should get them screened more often. And maybe you should get your kids screened earlier.\"\nHe hopes that over time more knowledge will be gained about the issue, and for a study into multi-cancer early detection tests to be introduced that could help catch any potential cancers, and help reassure people in the area.\nOther experts take a different view of the risks. \"There is a narrative that many people are sick from cancers, specifically from exposures while living next to Coldwater Creek for the last few decades\", says Roger Lewis, a professor in the environmental and occupations health department of St Louis University. \n\"But the data and studies don't indicate that. They show that there is some risk but it's small. It doesn't mean that it's not significant in some ways, but it's very limited.\" \nProf Lewis acknowledges the fear in the community, saying locals will feel safer if the government is clearer about its efforts  to eliminate any hazards. \nFor many people near Coldwater Creek, conversation with authorities is not easing the angst that comes with living in an area known for the dumping of nuclear waste.\n\"It\u2019s almost a given in our community that at some point we all expect to have some sort of cancer or illness,\u201d says Kim Visintine. \u201cThere\u2019s almost this apathy within our group that, well, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\"\nCorrection 16 March: This article originally reported that the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act covered parts of New Mexico. It has been amended to show that benefits were paid under the act to people in Arizona, Nevada and Utah, but not in New Mexico.",

        "article_text": "Every McDonald's in Britain has been warned its owners could face legal action if they fail to take steps to protect staff from sexual abuse.\nThe equality watchdog has written to all 1,400 branches telling them they must comply with their legal duties, or risk enforcement action, after a BBC investigation uncovered claims of a toxic culture of sexual assault and harassment.\nIn January, McDonald's workers told us they still faced sexual harassment more than a year after its chief executive promised to clean up behaviour at the fast-food chain.\nMcDonald's said it was \"committed\" to doing everything it can to ensure a safe working environment for all employees.\nIt added: \"We are confident that the plan we have in place is working.\"\nThe BBC has exclusively seen the letter from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\nWe asked one current McDonald's employee, who works for a franchise restaurant in southwest Scotland, for his reaction to it. He told us he hoped the intervention would lead to ''concrete change'' for people like him.\nThe 19-year-old worker, who we're calling Alan, told us in January he had been repeatedly subjected to \"degrading and humiliating\" verbal abuse by his colleagues, and faced \"homophobic slurs\".\nAlan still works there. He says things are not much different and he wants to \"get away\" from it.\nThe letter from the EHRC called the allegations in our investigation \"troubling\" and noted there have been \"repeated incidents\".\nThe vast majority of McDonald's restaurants are run by franchises, which means individual operators are licensed to run the outlets and employ the staff.\nIn February 2023, the watchdog entered into a legally binding agreement with McDonald's to prevent sexual harassment in its restaurants.\nFranchises were not covered by that agreement.\nBut in its latest letter, the EHRC said all businesses in Britain, small or large, must comply with the Equality Act.\n''It is your duty to ensure that any anti-discrimination and harassment measures you currently have in place are effective, and to take any necessary steps to protect your workers,\" the chief executive of the EHRC, John Kirkpatrick, told the restaurants.\nThe letter sets out the ''reasonable steps\" that restaurants could take to prevent sexual harassment.\nThese include regular risk assessments, ensuring younger and more vulnerable workers are properly safeguarded and ensuring complaints are dealt with sensitively and effectively through an established procedure.\nIt added that any franchise restaurant that does not comply with its legal duties \"may be at risk of enforcement action''.\nThe EHRC has a range of statutory enforcement powers open to it, including the ability to launch formal investigations.\nIf an organisation repeatedly refuses to comply, then the watchdog can take it through the courts, where an unlimited fine could be issued.\nLiam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, said the BBC's investigation of abuse at McDonald's had \"exposed malpractice which was totally and utterly unacceptable\".\nHe called for the EHRC to explain \"why it is only now writing to McDonald's restaurants about their new duty under the law, to prevent sexual harassment from taking place, when it came into effect nearly six months ago\".\nHe said it was \"especially concerning because the regulator has known about hundreds of allegations of harassment for several years\".\nHe added: \"Parliamentary committees have now twice found the vigour of their enforcement to be disappointing. It's now vital the public are reassured they're on top of the problem - and not behind the curve.\"\nEHRC head John Kirkpatrick told the BBC's Today programme that the letter was a \"starting point\".\n\"If it's not proving successful, we can investigate further. If we can find legal robust evidence of breaches of the law then we can impose an action plan on them and if they don't follow that, a court can impose fines on them,\" he said.\n\"The most effective and efficient way to make progress is through agreements but if that's not progressing adequately that's when we can take stronger and further action.\"\nThe BBC first began investigating working conditions at McDonald's more than two years ago, after the fast-food chain signed its agreement with the EHRC.\nIn July 2023, we published our initial investigation, which reported claims by workers, some as young as 17, of being groped and harassed almost routinely.\nAt the time, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.\nSince then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.\nEarlier this year, we reported that the watchdog plans to intervene again, \"in light of serious allegations raised by our work with the company, and the BBC investigation\".\nThe BBC understands the action plan will involve strengthening the existing measures - which included providing more training and conducting a survey of workers - as well as announcing new steps.\nAlistair Macrow, the boss of McDonald's in the UK, has been summoned twice to Parliament to answer questions in front of MPs since our initial investigation.\nIn January, he said 29 people had been dismissed over sexual harassment allegations over the past 12 months.\nIn a statement, a McDonald's spokesperson said the agreement with the EHRC was signed \"with the intention that it continues to evolve to ensure the robust measures we have in place are aligned with any updated guidance\".\nIt said the letter was sent \"to remind our franchisees of their legal obligations to provide a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace for their employees - which is the same legal requirement of all employers,\" adding that it \"welcomes\" any steps that mean it is continuing to make progress in this area.\nIt said that together with its franchisees, it is committed to doing everything it can to ensure a safe working environment for all employees, with initiatives and measures as part of a cultural action plan.\n\"These actions include everything from enhanced training programmes and onboarding practices, through to the launch of a new digital speak up channel designed with our and our franchisees' restaurant crew in mind,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are confident that the plan we have in place is working and making a difference to the near 170,000 people currently employed by McDonald's and our franchisees across McDonald's in the UK & Ireland today.\"\nThey added that its latest anonymous employee survey showed that 94% of people are aware of ways in which they can speak up.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nSome of the names in this story have been changed to protect identities.\nGet our flagship daily newsletter delivered straight to your inbox first thing, with all the latest headlines you need to start the day.

        "article_text": "Sleep can have a significant impact on athlete performance at the highest level\nGood sleep hygiene is a crucial competent of any top-level athlete's approach to fitness and wellbeing.\nPoor quality sleep can have a negative physical and mental impact, hindering an athlete's performance. But manage sleep well, and they can maximise their ability.\nFor World Sleep Day - 14 March - BBC Sport spoke to a sleep expert and international athlete to find out how elite sportspeople manage their sleep, and how you can improve yours.\nAccording to the NHS, adults require between seven and nine hours of sleep per night.\nGiven the changeable schedules athletes in elite sports are subject to, sticking to a strict sleep routine can be very difficult.\nThat means maintaining as much consistency as possible, even when on the road, can have a huge benefit.\nRemi Mobed, a physiotherapist with an expertise in sleep who has worked with the England men's national teams in football and rugby, supports the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team.\nHe says their approach is the \"gold standard\" for managing sleep in elite-level sport.\n\"In a group stage of a Tour de France, the cyclists are going to be in approximately 20 different hotels over the course of 22 days,\" he says.\n\"Each of those cyclists has their own dehumidifier, their own mattress, their own duvet and their own pillow that come as a travel pack. The team travels with that and the soigneur goes ahead and prepares the athlete's room for them prior to arrival, every day for 22 days.\n\"The reality for other team sports is to do the basics as well as you can, like getting the athletes to travel with an eye mask and their own pillow from home.\"\nIneos Grenadiers' Carlos Rodriguez, who benefits from Mobed's insight, finished seventh in the 2024 Tour de France\nDoubles tennis player Neal Skupski - a three-time Wimbledon champion - travels all over the world on the ATP Tour. For him, the constant change of location is part of the challenge.\n\"You're sleeping in a different bed each week - some mattresses hard, some soft,\" the 35-year-old says. \n\u201cFor a lot of the guys [the problem] is the pillows - they can mess you up. You can wake up with a bad neck and then you can't turn, and that hurts you especially on the serve.\n\"In the Olympic village in Paris last summer, one of the manufacturers allowed people to go to them and change the mattress hardness or softness. There was a line way out the door of athletes going in, testing the bed, trying to get a softer or harder one that suited them. The queue was so long I couldn't believe my eyes!\"\nCompeting worldwide requires athletes to traverse time zones and adjust their sleep schedules accordingly. So far in 2025, Skupski has played in Australia, Japan, Qatar, the UAE, and the US.\n\"People see players at tournaments on TV and sometimes think that they should be playing better, but it is probably down to the fact that their body is just knackered,\" the Liverpudlian says.\n\"I stay up as long as possible on a plane. Then if I get to Australia 12 o'clock in the afternoon, I would definitely stay up all day until around 10pm, just trying getting on the new time zone straight away.\n\"For the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Andy Murray was trying to get on time zone back in the UK a week in advance. So he was getting up around 2am and then starting his day, which I found crazy. But then he had a much better sleep when he got to Tokyo than me, so maybe I should have listened to him.\u201d\nMobed adds: \"As a general rule, if you're jumping three time zones, your body is able to cope with it. On top of that, it takes an athlete one day per hour that they've travelled to adjust.\n\"So if the difference is seven hours, the first three are fine to adjust to, and then it would be four days for the final four hours to be fully adjusted. Going across to Australia or New Zealand, 12 or 13 hours ahead, then that is a much bigger task.\"\nSkupski has represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup around the world since 2019\nIn team sports, athletes often share hotel rooms with a team-mate while travelling to away matches or international competitions.\n\"Coaches overlook sleep as a major factor,\" Mobed says. \"They often partner the strikers together, for instance, or the fly-halves, because the coaches want them to be discussing tactics. It is a mentorship system, thinking, 'this young kid can learn from Harry Kane through small conversations in the hotel room'.\n\"But the hotel room is not somewhere that should be done. That should be a place that is sacrosanct for the athletes to be in a relaxed state.\n\"You need to figure out who are the night owls and who are the morning larks. It is no good putting people in at the opposite end of the scale.\"\nAccording to NHS data, more than a million people in the UK were prescribed medication to help with sleep in 2023. Addiction to sleeping pills can lead to withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, panic attacks, sweating, headaches and shaking.\nBrentford captain Christian Norgaard revealed he feared becoming addicted to sleeping pills during his time with Brondby in his native Denmark, saying a sleep coach helped him avoid developing a serious problem.\n\"Sleeping pills are a really taboo subject in sport,\" Mobed says. \"There are many athletes, unfortunately, that are addicted to these sleep-enhancing meds.\n\"I think there is a time and a place for them, but the basics of sleep hygiene must be addressed first. Athletes often won't prioritise sleep, because they know that they can go to the doctor and get a sleeping pill.\n\"They can stay in your system for quite a prolonged period after you wake up. So let's say it gets to 1am and you're not sleeping so you take some of these meds - they are definitely still in your system the next morning.\"\nMelatonin is a hormone which can also be taken as a supplement to help sleep, but despite some of his doubles partners using it in the past, Skupski prefers to manage his sleep naturally\nNot everybody needs to be as precise about their sleep hygiene as an elite athlete, but getting good-quality sleep is important for the health and wellbeing of everyone.\n\"Naps should be no more than 40 minutes long, ideally 20,\" Mobed offers as a key tip. \"Some people will nap for one hour, two hours, three hours during the day, and that will have a massive detrimental effect.\n\"You've got this napping vicious cycle - sleeping too much in the day can actually completely put out your rhythm, and then at night you're not going to sleep well. You're then being counter-productive because the drowsiness goes into the next day.\"\nFor Skupski, one crucial change has made a big difference.\n\"I was waking up in the middle of the night and thinking, 'why am I wide awake?',\u201c he says.\n\"I was having coffee too late at night - having dinner and then a coffee around 7 or 8pm. One of the doctors told me you shouldn't be taking in coffee after 4pm because caffeine can stay in your system for eight hours.\"",

        "article_text": "Ireland will plan to freshen up their squad following the retirements of Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray \nIn the aftermath of a hard-fought win over Italy, as Ireland greeted the thousands of travelling supporters who made the trip to Rome, it was hard not to feel as though it was the end of an era.\nPushed all the way by the Azzurri, the Irish players waved to fans and loved ones in the Stadio Olimpico crowd after a harder-than-expected 22-17 victory.\nThe scenes were reminiscent of the 2023 World Cup in France, where Ireland temporarily made the Stade de France their home away from home with memorable wins over South Africa and Scotland. \nBoth tales ultimately ended in heartache. Their World Cup adventure was ended by New Zealand while, in the Italian capital on Saturday, any faint Irish hopes of remaining at the Six Nations summit were emphatically crushed when England put Wales to the sword.\nIt ensured a dispiriting end to a Six Nations that at one stage promised much for Ireland. \nA Triple Crown-securing win over Wales in round three stirred hopes of a Grand Slam and a third straight title, only for France to tear up the script in Dublin. \nBut unlike England, who scored 10 tries in a record win in Cardiff, Ireland were unable to sign off in style, instead allowing Italy to dream of victory up until the closing stages.\nIreland's title hopes end despite bonus-point win in Italy\nIreland 'trying a bit too hard' in Italy win - Easterby\nThis video can not be played\nSheehan shines as Ireland hold off Italy in Rome\nThe World Cup was seen as Ireland's big chance. A year removed from a historic series success in New Zealand and six months on from completing the Grand Slam on home soil, it felt as though the squad were peaking at the right time. \nIt proved a false dawn. Johnny Sexton, the heartbeat of Irish rugby, was denied a fairytale ending to his Test career. Eighteen months on, three of his long-time team-mates - Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray - bow out amid a feeling of what might have been. \nAnd the curtain closing on three more illustrious careers in green brings into focus the need for Ireland to evolve. \nEven before the France game, Paul O'Connell admitted the squad will encounter \"days when we struggle\" given the experience drain. \nAnd while striking a more positive note, Caelan Doris hammered home the need for improvement on the road ahead as he recapped his first Six Nations as captain on Saturday. \n\"There are obviously lots of things we can learn and grow from over the last couple of weeks and I hope that it will be a springboard for us as a group to go on and continue to evolve, and a bit of a realisation that there's still a lot of work to be done and a lot in us,\" said the Irish skipper. \nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders\nFor the first time in 14 years, O'Mahony will not be part of that work. \nHaving poured his lot into the Irish cause over a career that yielded 114 caps and five Six Nations titles - including one as captain - the Munster great is looking forward to watching games from the stands with his family. \nAnd as he bows out, O'Mahony - as well-placed as anyone to comment on the health of Irish rugby - insists the team is still in \"incredible shape\" despite a third-place finish, considering where they have come from. \nO'Mahony, of course, was one of the last links to the darker days, pointing to the famous 2013 loss to Italy in Rome. \nIreland finished fifth that year, but rebuilt impressively under Joe Schmidt after Declan Kidney's departure, capturing back-to-back titles in 2014 and 2015 before the Grand Slam three years later.\n\"Now the expectation of everyone in Ireland when we take to the pitch is that we win,\" said O'Mahony, who received a rapturous ovation when he replaced Josh van der Flier after 51 minutes against Italy.\n\"The expectation when we start the Six Nations is that we win the Six Nations. That's down to the hard work of the players. We've gone from hoping to expecting. Over the space of a decade or so, we've changed the mindset of players and supporters to expect nothing but wins from Ireland. \n\"That group is one of the most talented you'll ever come across from an Irish point of view. I look at the younger players I've been lucky enough to play alongside over the past eight weeks, it's getting better and better. \n\"It gives me a huge amount of pride, Cian [Healy] spoke inside about leaving a mark on the younger players and if I've made a little difference or shown them a few things not to do, I'd be a happy man.\"\nProp Jack Boyle was the only Ireland debutant during this year's Six Nations\nThe pain of relinquishing their Six Nations crown will be acute in the days ahead, but Ireland have much to look forward to in the remainder of 2025. \nHowever, before a Chicago rematch against the All Blacks and mouthwatering Dublin Tests against Australia and South Africa in November, interim boss Simon Easterby will oversee a summer tour. \nWhile the details have not been confirmed, matches against Georgia, Romania and Portugal have been mooted. \nRegardless of the opponents, though, it will be a crucial period as Easterby looks to future-proof the squad and introduce new talent to the international game while his frontline players are on the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. \nSince last year's Six Nations triumph, Ireland have blooded Jamie Osborne, Tom Clarkson, Sam Prendergast, Cormac Izuchukwu, Gus McCarthy and Jack Boyle. \nBut outside of the retiring O'Mahony and Conor Murray, 10 of Ireland's 23 against Italy are at least 30 years of age, highlighting the need for squad progression. \nSummer tours on Lions years have in the past been fertile ground for Ireland. The 2017 tour to Japan, for example, marked the emergence of Jacob Stockdale, Andrew Porter and James Ryan. \nWhether or not Ireland uncover a similar calibre of player this year remains to be seen, but there appears an acknowledgement of the need to deepen the squad before Andy Farrell's return from Lions duty. \nNow the work must start.",

Their World Cup adventure was ended by New Zealand while, in the Italian capital on Saturday, any faint Irish hopes of remaining at the Six Nations summit were emphatically crushed when England put Wales to the sword.It ensured a dispiriting end to a Six Nations that at one stage promised much for Ireland.

        "article_text": "On Friday, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, found himself in a particularly uncomfortable position.\nPresident Donald Trump was singing his praises. And former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other influential Democrats were expressing their dismay with him \u2013 or worse.\nThis was Schumer's fate the day after he decided to back a Republican-crafted measure to avert a possible US government shutdown this weekend. \nLater, he followed through on his promise, voting with nine other Democrats and all but one Republican to overcome the key procedural hurdle that - if Democrats had stuck together in opposition - would have prevented  the funding bill from coming to a final vote.\nThe Senate bill, which passed that final vote shortly after, contained a number of provisions that angered liberals. These included cuts to non-military programmes, increased spending on border security, limits on how Congress can rescind Trump's tariffs and draconian restrictions on Washington DC's budget.\nSchumer acknowledged all of this, but said he was backing the bill because a shutdown, which would allow the president to determine what government services and employees to suspend, would be worse.\n\"I believe it is the best way to minimise the harm that the Trump administration will do to the American people,\" he said on Friday. \"Allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via government shutdown is a far worse option.\"\nIt didn't take long after Schumer's announcement for Democratic second guessing \u2013 and straight-up outrage \u2013 to ensue.\n\"Chuck Schumer is unwilling and unable to meet the moment,\" the Democratic group Pass the Torch, which led calls for Joe Biden to end his re-election bid last summer, said in a statement.\nPelosi, who wields considerable influence among House Democrats despite having stepped down from her leadership position, decried what she said was a \"false choice\" between a shutdown and accepting the Republican measure.\n\"We must fight back in a better way,\" she said, suggesting a short-term funding extension and new bipartisan negotiations. She called the Republican bill a \"blank cheque that makes a devastating assault on the well-being of working families across America\".\nIn a Friday press conference, the current House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, dodged questions about Schumer. When asked if he still had confidence in his Senate counterpart, he tersely replied: \"Next question.\"\nOthers in the party were less circumspect. Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia told reporters that he expected \"new leadership\" in the Senate next year \u2013 or after the next presidential election in 2028.\nA group of 60 House Democrats \u2013 who joined all but one in their party to vote against the Republican bill in that chamber \u2013 penned a letter to Schumer, saying that the legislation \"potentially legitimises President Trump and the Republican party's dismantling of government\".\n\"If Republicans in Congress want to pass this bill,\" they wrote, \"they should do so with their own votes.\"\nAs if to add rub salt on Democratic wounds, Trump took to his Truth Social website on Friday morning to praise what he said was a \"good and smart move\" by Schumer \u2013 and to promise that more Republican legislation on taxes, spending and \"so much more\" was coming.\n\"This could lead to something big for USA,\" he wrote, \"a whole new direction and beginning!\"\nWhile many rank-and-file Democrats and liberal activists clamoured for Schumer and Senate Democrats to block the House measure even if it triggered a government shutdown, it is unclear whether such a move would have pressured Trump and Republicans to negotiate a less partisan government-funding bill.\nIn fact, there are many on the right, including Trump's designated government slasher, Elon Musk, who were relishing an opportunity to use a shutdown to further hamstring the federal bureaucracy. \nAfter days, or weeks, of shutdown pain that would disproportionately affect their supporters, the Democratic Party could have found itself in the same place it is now \u2013 with limited power and few good options.\n\"Neither House Democrats nor the people voting 'no' in the Senate nor the people getting mad on Twitter have an actual strategy for getting what the base wants out of this, which is some kind of act of Congress saying that Trump and Musk need to conduct the government differently,\" writes Matthew Yglesias, a left-leaning commentator.\nDemocrats have the power to block Republican legislation, but they simply don't have the votes to advance their own alternative either in the House or the Senate.\nThat doesn't make the situation Schumer and the Democrats have found themselves in any easier to stomach, however. Republicans, by sticking together, have been able to exert their will in Congress, while Trump pushes the boundaries of presidential power.\nElections, as they say, have consequences. And 2024's results have left Democrats deep in the wilderness.",

        "article_text": "Cher Horowitz has brought her life of Beverly Hills high fashion, friendship and matchmaking to London's West End, as classic 1990s teen film Clueless has been given a musical makeover.\nClueless has been brought to the stage by the film's original writer and director Amy Heckerling - who says keeping the 90s theme was integral to the show.\nHeckerling insists she has \"no interest in being modern\" - which will come as a relief to the audiences who grew up quoting \"As if!\" and aspiring to Cher's plaid and Prada-filled wardrobe.\nThe story follows the life of the na\u00efve and lovably spoiled teenager, who plays matchmaker with her friends before ultimately finding love herself. \nAn adaption of Jane Austen's Emma, Clueless captured the teen spirit of the 90s and inspired countless school dramas like Mean Girls, Gossip Girl and Legally Blonde.\nThe stage version has songs in the form of an original score by singer-songwriter KT Tunstall.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Tunstall says the film was \"omnipotent\" in the 90s and influenced everything from the clothes people wore to the music people listened to.\nThe Scottish singer, best known for songs like Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See, says working on the show was a \"dream project\".\nShe says the original soundtrack was a big inspiration, and describes the music as \"a mixtape of all your favourite 90s bangers\".\nThe process of creating the soundtrack for Clueless: The Musical was intense for Tunstall, who says it's no easy feat to add music to an adaptation of a film that didn't originally have it.\n\"You really have to think about whether a song fits the structure and flow of the story and whether it actually helps the audience understand the narrative better,\" she says.\nHeckerling says she actually wishes the film had been a musical because \"there were natural moments in the script where characters could have sung\".\n\"Those types of films weren't very common in the 90s but I'm glad we could add in music now,\" she says.\nCritics had mixed thoughts about the new songs - the Guardian called them \"disappointingly flat-footed\" in a two-star review and said the lyrics \"too often serve as exposition rather than raising the emotional drama\". \nSimilarly, the Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish wrote that the show has \"numbers designed to sound in keeping with the period but which are so generic they don't ring with real-world authenticity\". \nBut What'sOnStage praised Tunstall's \"infuriatingly catchy tunes\" and Glenn Slater's \"nifty, witty lyrics\".\nFor Emma Flynn, who is making her West End debut as Cher, the music has another important function in the show - it allows characters to easily share their inner thoughts with the audience. \n\"In the film you hear these really funny inner monologues of Cher, but the great thing about this show is you can hear all of the character's thoughts, which makes you feel more connected to them.\"\nFlynn has been praised by critics, with the Evening Standard noting her \"powerfully-sung breakout performance\" and describing it as channelling \"both Alicia Silverstone in the original movie and Sabrina Carpenter today, while making the role entirely her own\".\nCo-star Keelan McAuley, who plays nerdy Josh, tells the BBC he loves the play's nostalgia factor. \n\"The flip phone was the most advanced technology they had in the 90s and there's something so enchanting about a time where there was no access to social media,\" he says.\nThe show stays almost entirely true to the 1995 film, with everyone sporting the latest 90s fashions, carrying a glitzy pager, and listening to angsty teen bangers on a Walkman. \nWhile it may feel like a nostalgia fest, Heckerling admits she doesn't \"like to stick to real life\", and even her sunny film was far from the reality of what the 90s were like for most teenagers in LA, with race riots and other political problems. \nThe Independent's three-star review says the show \"sticks to the original movie like chewing gum to the underside of a school desk\" at first, but changes tack by the second half.\n\"[Director Rachel] Kavanaugh and Heckerling gain the confidence to part ways a bit from the movie's script, and to let the story's heart show,\" Alice Saville wrote.\nFor Tunstall, what sets Clueless apart from traditional rom-coms and high school dramas is that there isn't a typical villain and there's no nastiness or bad intentions from the main characters. \nJane Austen famously thought her main character wouldn't be a widely liked heroine, but Tunstall says she is often people's favourite character because of her honesty and depth.\n\"People can relate to her on a deeper level, like how she is trying to process the death of her mother and help keep her family in order.\n\"Those themes are universal and that's what makes this story so enduring.\"",

        "article_text": "Every McDonald's in Britain has been warned its owners could face legal action if they fail to take steps to protect staff from sexual abuse.\nThe equality watchdog has written to all 1,400 branches telling them they must comply with their legal duties, or risk enforcement action, after a BBC investigation uncovered claims of a toxic culture of sexual assault and harassment.\nIn January, McDonald's workers told us they still faced sexual harassment more than a year after its chief executive promised to clean up behaviour at the fast-food chain.\nMcDonald's said it was \"committed\" to doing everything it can to ensure a safe working environment for all employees.\nIt added: \"We are confident that the plan we have in place is working.\"\nThe BBC has exclusively seen the letter from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\nWe asked one current McDonald's employee, who works for a franchise restaurant in southwest Scotland, for his reaction to it. He told us he hoped the intervention would lead to ''concrete change'' for people like him.\nThe 19-year-old worker, who we're calling Alan, told us in January he had been repeatedly subjected to \"degrading and humiliating\" verbal abuse by his colleagues, and faced \"homophobic slurs\".\nAlan still works there. He says things are not much different and he wants to \"get away\" from it.\nThe letter from the EHRC called the allegations in our investigation \"troubling\" and noted there have been \"repeated incidents\".\nThe vast majority of McDonald's restaurants are run by franchises, which means individual operators are licensed to run the outlets and employ the staff.\nIn February 2023, the watchdog entered into a legally binding agreement with McDonald's to prevent sexual harassment in its restaurants.\nFranchises were not covered by that agreement.\nBut in its latest letter, the EHRC said all businesses in Britain, small or large, must comply with the Equality Act.\n''It is your duty to ensure that any anti-discrimination and harassment measures you currently have in place are effective, and to take any necessary steps to protect your workers,\" the chief executive of the EHRC, John Kirkpatrick, told the restaurants.\nThe letter sets out the ''reasonable steps\" that restaurants could take to prevent sexual harassment.\nThese include regular risk assessments, ensuring younger and more vulnerable workers are properly safeguarded and ensuring complaints are dealt with sensitively and effectively through an established procedure.\nIt added that any franchise restaurant that does not comply with its legal duties \"may be at risk of enforcement action''.\nThe EHRC has a range of statutory enforcement powers open to it, including the ability to launch formal investigations.\nIf an organisation repeatedly refuses to comply, then the watchdog can take it through the courts, where an unlimited fine could be issued.\nLiam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, said the BBC's investigation of abuse at McDonald's had \"exposed malpractice which was totally and utterly unacceptable\".\nHe called for the EHRC to explain \"why it is only now writing to McDonald's restaurants about their new duty under the law, to prevent sexual harassment from taking place, when it came into effect nearly six months ago\".\nHe said it was \"especially concerning because the regulator has known about hundreds of allegations of harassment for several years\".\nHe added: \"Parliamentary committees have now twice found the vigour of their enforcement to be disappointing. It's now vital the public are reassured they're on top of the problem - and not behind the curve.\"\nEHRC head John Kirkpatrick told the BBC's Today programme that the letter was a \"starting point\".\n\"If it's not proving successful, we can investigate further. If we can find legal robust evidence of breaches of the law then we can impose an action plan on them and if they don't follow that, a court can impose fines on them,\" he said.\n\"The most effective and efficient way to make progress is through agreements but if that's not progressing adequately that's when we can take stronger and further action.\"\nThe BBC first began investigating working conditions at McDonald's more than two years ago, after the fast-food chain signed its agreement with the EHRC.\nIn July 2023, we published our initial investigation, which reported claims by workers, some as young as 17, of being groped and harassed almost routinely.\nAt the time, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.\nSince then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.\nEarlier this year, we reported that the watchdog plans to intervene again, \"in light of serious allegations raised by our work with the company, and the BBC investigation\".\nThe BBC understands the action plan will involve strengthening the existing measures - which included providing more training and conducting a survey of workers - as well as announcing new steps.\nAlistair Macrow, the boss of McDonald's in the UK, has been summoned twice to Parliament to answer questions in front of MPs since our initial investigation.\nIn January, he said 29 people had been dismissed over sexual harassment allegations over the past 12 months.\nIn a statement, a McDonald's spokesperson said the agreement with the EHRC was signed \"with the intention that it continues to evolve to ensure the robust measures we have in place are aligned with any updated guidance\".\nIt said the letter was sent \"to remind our franchisees of their legal obligations to provide a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace for their employees - which is the same legal requirement of all employers,\" adding that it \"welcomes\" any steps that mean it is continuing to make progress in this area.\nIt said that together with its franchisees, it is committed to doing everything it can to ensure a safe working environment for all employees, with initiatives and measures as part of a cultural action plan.\n\"These actions include everything from enhanced training programmes and onboarding practices, through to the launch of a new digital speak up channel designed with our and our franchisees' restaurant crew in mind,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are confident that the plan we have in place is working and making a difference to the near 170,000 people currently employed by McDonald's and our franchisees across McDonald's in the UK & Ireland today.\"\nThey added that its latest anonymous employee survey showed that 94% of people are aware of ways in which they can speak up.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nSome of the names in this story have been changed to protect identities.\nGet our flagship daily newsletter delivered straight to your inbox first thing, with all the latest headlines you need to start the day.

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

It is not just the breakdown, but there is a physical raw edge to everything they are doing.\n\"It all makes your job so much easier, their back row were unbelievable.\"\nIn this year's Six Nations, England lead the way for turnovers won (36), slowing down their opponents' ruck speed, and jackals won (21).\nThe depth in the back row is only growing after 20-year-old Northampton Saints flanker Henry Pollock scored two tries on his debut, 21-year-old Chandler Cunningham-South also dotted down twice against Wales, while number eight Tom Willis, 26, impressed on his three starts.\nListen: The Six Nations review with Barclay and Warburton\n'Special' Pollock predicted try-scoring Test debut\n'I have not seen that complete an England performance for years'\nThis video can not be played\n'WRU must cut a region to solve Welsh rugby crisis' - Warburton\nWales' match in Italy in round two was their best shot of a victory this campaign but defeat ended Warren Gatland's troubled reign and left interim head coach Matt Sherratt with a tough task to restore pride in his three games in charge.\nHope that they could end their dreadful run of defeats before the end of the championship grew after a much-improved performance against Ireland.\nHowever, the campaign finished with Wales falling to a new low by conceding 68 points against England - the most in their Six Nations history.\nA 17th Test defeat on the bounce was also a record for a tier-one nation in the professional era and condemned Wales to a second successive Wooden Spoon.\nFormer Wales captain Sam Warburton believes now is the time for \"big changes\" and suggests cutting one of the Welsh regions in the United Rugby Championship.\n\"No action is the worst action now,\" he told Six Nations Rugby Special.\n\"Four regions do not work. Look at the impact - by accident - of losing three teams in the [English] Premiership. We need to concentrate our player pool into three teams.\n\"You can't make a decision that pleases everyone but you have to try and make the best decision that genuinely has the best impact on Welsh rugby.\n\"I can't see us winning another championship for five years, but if there is a five-year plan to buy into and get on board with then we will be on the right path.\"\nWelsh rugby reaches record low as England run riot \n'Wales players need support after record loss'\nSix Nations: France take the title and England thrash Wales\nThis video can not be played\nSheehan shines as Ireland hold off Italy but title bid falls short\nIreland began this year's Six Nations aiming for a record third successive title, and with games against England and France at home that goal seemed more than realistic.\nVictory in their final match against Italy meant Simon Easterby's side ended the campaign in third place with four wins out of five - the same as England and France - but the feeling in Rome differed from their rivals.\nA crushing defeat in Dublin against champions France ended their Grand Slam bid, and even with a possible title on the line, Ireland's championship petered out, with Italy pushing for a shock victory in the closing stages.\nThe campaign marked the end of the road for a trio of Test centurions as Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray all bowed out of the international arena.\nEight of Ireland's starting XV against France were also aged 30 or older, and Warburton feels there is going to be a \"good changing of the guard\" over the next three to four years in Irish rugby.\n\"When they start to lose those players [in their mid-30s], you start to think there is maybe not as much coming through as they would have had five to 10 years ago,\" he said.\n\"It is a bit alarming so they might want to hang on to those older players until some more players start to come through.\"\nInterim head coach Easterby will continue the transition this summer before Andy Farrell returns after British and Irish Lions duty this summer.\n'Evolution beckons for Ireland as legends bow out'\nIreland 'trying a bit too hard' in Italy win - Easterby\nBloodgate: The scandal that rocked rugby union\nThis video can not be played\nWhy France were deserved Six Nations winners\nFrance have been the great entertainers this championship, scoring a record 30 tries in five games to win their first title since 2022.\nIt was not all plain sailing in the first half against Scotland as a disallowed try prevented the visitors from leading at half-time.\nHowever, a dominant second-half display saw France score three tries to get the win they needed, with wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey racing clear for a record eighth score of the championship.\n\"He is probably going to get player of the tournament,\" Warburton said. \"A real superstar, another one France have to lean on.\"\nFabien Galthie again opted for a 7-1 bench split, which has proved a point of difference, as his side scored 1.2 more tries per game in the final 40 minutes.\nThey also gained more metres and line breaks on average in the second half of games.\n\"Their tries against Scotland were all caused from their power and physicality,\" Warburton added.\n\"When France got into the Scotland 22, Scotland found it difficult to contain them. I have it as 23 points scored from maul and carry dominance which led on to tries.\n\"In international rugby, if you win the power game, you win the game.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBielle-Biarrey stars in Six Nations best tries\nAre Scotland flattering to deceive?

        "article_text": "Bruno Fernandes scored Manchester United's late third in their win at Leicester\nCaptain Bruno Fernandes insists he will be his own man - and on current form Manchester United would not have it any other way. \nHis fifth goal in a week capped United's 3-0 Premier League win at Leicester, with the Portugal international taking another starring role.\nTwo assists and a goal followed the hat-trick in Thursday's 4-1 Europa League win over Real Sociedad to set up a quarter-final tie with Lyon, and a strike in last weekend's 1-1 draw against Arsenal.\nAs Ruben Amorim's side rose to 13th with victory at the King Power Stadium, Fernandes' display came after former United skipper Roy Keane criticised him last month, saying 'talent is not enough'.\nBut Fernandes, who has 16 goals and 15 assists for United this season, brushed off the criticism.\n\"I do things in my own way,\" said the 30-year-old. \nHojlund ends 21-game goal drought in Man Utd win at Leicester\nFernandes hat-trick puts Man Utd into last eight\n\"Obviously it's not nice to hear those things about you, but at the same time it motivates you and obviously people think there's a lot of things you need to improve. \n\"You have to take it in a positive understanding that whatever people are saying, if it's a margin to improve or not. I have a huge respect for Roy Keane.\n\"Obviously not everything I do everyone will like or think in the same way and I respect everyone's opinion and I have huge respect for Roy Keane and I accept there's a lot of margin for improvement in my game, in my leadership and everything I do in my life.\"\nFernandes has been involved in 31 goals across all competitions this season, with only Mohamed Salah (54) and Erling Haaland (33) having more goal involvements among Premier League players.\nSince his United debut in February 2020, only Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne (90) has recorded more assists across all competitions for a side in Europe's big five leagues than Fernandes (80). \nAfter a routine win at second-bottom Leicester, he told Sky Sports: \"We knew it would be difficult and we had to be at our very best level. First half, we committed mistakes in the transition, but second half we were better at getting control of the game and getting the goals.\n\"Against Arsenal we were a little bit more deep on the pitch, we felt they didn't have much up front in terms of pace.\n\"I think you can see some progress, but that has to go on and on. We have important games.\n\"I want to score many goals as I can as it's a big part of my game and I need to assist my team-mates. I need to get on to the edge of the box and get goals as it is one of my qualities.\"\nAmorim also reserved praise for Fernandes, who set up goals for Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho, before slotting home a late strike.\nThe United boss said: \"He's a special guy in that aspect, he is always ready, he can recover quite well. I don't know the future but I'm reading what the performance department tell me, the numbers, and then what I see in the game.\n\"I always see a Bruno that is dangerous and one Bruno that can recover in every situation. So he is going to stay there.\n\"I already knew Bruno. What surprised me the most is the way he works every day, that was a surprise. \n\"We in Portugal see Bruno with that frustration and I was really surprised, he is a very good professional.

She's probably one of the smartest businesswomen I've ever seen,\" Riley says. \nSwift is famously re-recording six albums after her former music manager Scooter Braun gained control of the master recordings.\nShe has said she saw it as a an act of aggression that \"stripped me of my life's work\". \nRiley said Swift's experiences showed her the importance of keeping the rights to her songs and gave her the confidence to explore other genres of music.\n\"You're na\u00efve when you're younger,\" says Riley, who was 11 when she was introduced to Swift's music by a school friend, inspiring her to write her own songs. \n\"You think 'I'll write the songs, I'll wear the dresses, I'll play on the stages and somebody else will handle the business aspect of things' but actually Taylor has shown me that's not the case.\"\nFollowing Swift's example, Riley worked hard and saved to produce her own music \"song by song, one by one\", while retaining the rights to them.\nSince starting her career at age 17, Riley has toured with fellow Scottish artists ili and Tide Lines.\nRecent trips to Nashville to collaborate and meet others in the industry have helped develop her career and the confidence to stay as an independent artist until the time is right.\n\"I used to hate the thought of being independent. It had a stigma attached that they're not good enough to get signed or they won't be able to do it,\" she says.\n\"When I realised what that word meant - that you don't need anyone and can accomplish things by yourself - I look back at my music that I've saved up song by song to produce, it was a ton of work but it's so worth it to see people listen to those songs.\"\nRiley's passion for music began after being introduced to artists like James Taylor and Joni Mitchell by her dad. Her grandmother gave her a book of poetry, leading her to write her own \"poems to a tune\".\nLike many teenagers, Riley enjoyed attending concerts but felt something different when she saw country artists perform.\n\"These country music gigs absolutely blew me away,\" she says.\n\"It had a hold on me and it made me realise I wanted to do that myself.\"\nRiley soon began to appreciate other country music artists - Ella Langley, Megan Moroney, Carter Faith and - to her, \"the Queen of everything\"- Kelsea Ballerini.\nFunding from charity Help Musicians was the key that allowed Riley to visit the country music city of Nashville and work on her new EP.\nThe EP even has nods to her hometown, mentioning Glasgow streets as well as a song dedicated to Maggie's Rock n Rodeo, a popular venue for country music fans.\n\"My song writing inspiration absolutely comes mixed from Glasgow and Nashville,\" she says.\n\"Glasgow feels a lot like Nashville to me. \n\"When I got to Nashville the first time, I phoned my mum and she asked how it was. I said it literally feels just like home.\"\nRiley is performing at King Tut's as part of the Country to Country festival on Sunday 16 March.",

        "article_text": "A mum whose friend's death from leukaemia prompted her to bank stem cells from her newborn's umbilical cord has described it as a \"back-up\" which has brought her reassurance.\nNatalie Harrop, 40, from Newport, arranged to have a stem cell harvesting procedure with her baby son Arthur and said it was a \"really straightforward\" but important process.\nThe cells remain banked for the family to use if needed until Arthur turns 25, after which they can decide whether or not to donate them.\nLeukaemia & Myeloma Research UK (LMRUK) said stem cells could be used for future treatment of blood cancers and other life-threatening illnesses, and described them as \"effective biological health insurance\".\nMs Harrop, a school wellbeing officer, was inspired to research leukaemia and cancer treatments following the death of her friend and colleague Jacqueline Walsh.\nShe described Ms Walsh as \"a lovely lady\" who was generous with her time, raising money for many different charities. \"She touched everybody's hearts,\" she added.\nOne area of research Ms Harrop became interested in was stem cell harvesting, after discovering there were more than a million blood-producing stem cells in the blood within the umbilical cord and placenta.\nPregnant with her fourth child, Arthur, Ms Harrop discussed the procedure with her partner Gary Hardwick-Bishop, who agreed that they should apply to have it done.\nThe procedure involves the cells being retrieved from the umbilical cord after birth, stored and then collected to be banked.\n\"It feels like you've got a little back-up there, so if anything does come up, we have that on the side if we ever do need it,\" said Ms Harrop, whose other children are aged eight, 14 and 18.\n\"And not just for our family, but for anyone who is a DNA match to Arthur or to me, anybody that needs them.\"\nMs Harrop explained there were some criteria they had to meet to be eligible, including having someone in their family who had had cancer.\n\"Gary's dad had cancer in the past and recovered, so it was really important to him as well, and my grandad died of cancer when I was young,\" she said.\nThe mum said she faced \"quite a few barriers\" and had to \"jump through a few hoops\" to gather the correct documentation, but added she felt this was due to a lack of awareness among medical professionals and said the process itself was completely non-invasive.\nShe now hopes raising awareness about it will make the process more widely considered.\nMs Harrop recalled one midwife being quite unsure about it and asking if she was \"jinxing herself\".\n\"There's nothing negative that can come from it. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, if the stem cells get damaged, they get damaged, but at least you've tried.\"\nAfter seeking out her grandfather's death certificate as part of the application process and seeing his name, Arthur, on it, Ms Harrop said it also prompted the couple to name their baby after him.\nMr Hardwick-Bishop contacted the phlebotomist when Ms Harrop went into labour and Arthur was born at The Grange hospital in Cwmbran, Torfaen, on 31 October 2023 following a \"horrendous birth\".\n\"I ended up having an emergency caesarean, but whether you have a good birth or a bad birth you can still collect the cells, it doesn't really matter,\" said Ms Harrop.\nThe cord and placenta cells were transferred into a freezer, which stayed beside Ms Harrop at the hospital until they were collected and taken to a bank.\n\"They sent me a letter and a little certificate as well,\" she said.\nShe continued: \"Since we kept his stem cells I've done a bit more research and it just seems like it's really difficult when children or adults need stem cells, they're not on hand.\n\"Which seems such a shame, when there are so many births daily. It just baffles me there are all these stem cells going to waste.\"\nLMRUK runs a cord blood banking service, the Model Cell Biobank, and said taking stem cells from a baby's umbilical cord was \"effective biological health insurance\", providing options for treatment of the child or another member of the family should they need the stem cells in the future because of a serious illness, including blood cancer.\nLMRUK recently partnered with Smart Cells International, a private stem cell storage company, to procure, process and store cord blood stem cells for qualifying families.\nThe service is means-tested and is part-funded for some families, and fully funded for others, such as Ms Harrop's.\nDr Joanna Tilley, operations director at LMRUK, said stem cells were \"vital\" in cancer treatment, adding medical research was revealing new potential future uses for them.\nMs Harrop added: \"Any new mums considering this, there is absolutely nothing to lose.\n\"If Jacki was alive, she was such a funny person and I can just imagine her saying it was amazing, she'd be the first one to be promoting anything like this.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nHampson reflects on life-altering injury and life-changing influence\nMatt Hampson could not breathe by himself and was drifting in and out of consciousness when medics cut his England jersey off him.\nIt was half a lifetime ago that the now 40-year-old was in intensive care, having been left paralysed from the neck down when a scrum collapsed in a training session with the Under-21 national team.\nHe recalls the faces around him immediately after the incident, the \"shell-shocked\" looks, the sense of helplessness when he could not feel his arms and legs, and waking up in the back of an ambulance after \"blacking out\" before being resuscitated.\nHe was only 20 years old then. Now, 20 years on, the former Leicester Tigers prop remembers how it all felt \"so surreal\" when he was rushed to Northampton General Hospital.\nThe injury left Hampson only able to breathe through a ventilator and as \"bizarre and scary\" as that struck him at the time, he admits he was momentarily distracted from the life-changing chaos of it all.\n\"Having my England kit that I was so proud of being cut off me with scissors was a small trivial thing I was thinking of,\" Hampson told BBC East Midlands Today.\n\"I was so proud of playing for England with the rose on my chest, and then having that kit cut off me, I was just thinking of that rather than thinking of myself.\"\nHampson had started the day - 15 March, 2005 - by slipping that England shirt on as one of the nation's finest rising rugby union prospects.\nIt was with the academy at Leicester Tigers, a club renowned for developing forwards of fierce pedigree, that Hampson worked hard to gain that reputation.\n\"I wasn't a natural rugby player, but I wanted it, I was hungry for it and was passionate about it,\" he said.\n\"Rugby was my purpose and what I could do to channel my energy. I felt like it was my calling.\"\nHampson reflects on foundation's work as he turns 40\nI was too busy to die - Hampson\n'Get busy living or get busy dying' - Hampson reflects on injury 10 years on \nThat calling, however, was silenced in harrowing circumstances which sent him in a different direction.\nHe would go on to spend 18 months at Stoke Mandeville Hospital - home of the National Spinal Injuries Centre - and after that he said there was \"a lot of soul searching\" about what would come next.\n\"You are a rugby player, so to redefine yourself was massively important,\" he said.\n\"It was obviously a turning point in my life and initially I struggled to justify why it happened to me and why life would never be the same again. But now I understand.\"\nHe says this while at the Get Busy Living Centre, a state-of-the art facility that he is the driving force behind, which offers total support to those in a similar situation.\nThe centre, which is nestled among farmland outside Melton Mowbray in rural Leicestershire, is also home of the foundation set up in Hampson's name.\n\"I come into the driveway and see the foundation and centre and this is what it's all about,\" he said.\n\"This is why it happened. Realising how much support I had and how many people that I'd be able to help and influence, just through my journey and my story - to show people that there is a great life to be had in this situation.\"\nMatt Hampson was awarded an OBE in 2022 and received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Leicester in January\nIt was the support that Hampson got after his accident that made him realise what could be possible.\nIn hospital he was visited by so many people that he ended up needing a booking system to stay on top of it all. As a high-profile injury that rocked the rugby world, there was also a lot of money donated to help him and his family cope.\nHe knew he was \"blessed\" to be in that position, but also saw that many were not so fortunate.\n\"It didn't just come to me straightaway,\" Hampson said of plans for his foundation and the centre. \"The trust fund was sort of thrust upon me where people were raising money for me. \n\"I felt very grateful for that and I felt that I needed to give something back. The natural progression for the trust was to turn into a foundation, a charity to help other people.\n\"The most worthwhile thing we can do in our life is to make an impression on someone else's life.\"\nHow many people the foundation and centre have supported over the years, Hampson can't put an exact number on.\nBut it is hundreds who have sought access to expert physiotherapists, specialist personal trainers, wellbeing support and other tailored healthy living advice at the centre.\nAccommodation has been set up there recently to help offer even greater levels of access, and there are further redevelopment plans for the site and aspirations to expand its reach with satellite centres around the country.\nSome people who have come through the centre have even gone on establish themselves as athletes, competing at the Paralympic Games. Among them are Nick Cummins and Jamie Stead, who were both part of ParalympicsGB's gold medal-winning wheelchair rugby side at the Tokyo games in 2021.\nGraham Lee, a Grand National-winning jockey who suffered a spinal injury in 2024 in a riding accident, went direct to the centre from hospital to start his rehabilitation.\n\"The second I got out of the van, Matt was there,\" Lee said. \"He is a class act in every way.\"\nWhen Hampson turned 40 last year, he spoke of his pride in how he, and those he works with, have \"shaken things up for the disability world\".\n\"The world is a lot more inclusive. You were just existing back then,\" Hampson said when reflecting on the support he received after he first left hospital with his injury.\n\"Now you can get busy living and you can do things. It's a challenge, every day is a challenge, but it makes it enjoyable and makes it worthwhile.\n\"You feel like you are actually getting somewhere, actually changing the world for disabled people but also changing the world for a lot of other people as well.\n\"I'm immensely proud of what we do here.\"\nNatalie Jackson, BBC East Midlands Today sports editor:\nI have been covering Matt Hampson's story for 20 years and first met him in Stoke Mandeville Hospital not long after his accident. \nWhen he was first injured he could only communicate by blinking and clicking, and his injury is the worst level of tetraplegia \u2013 paralysed  from the neck down and on a ventilator.  \nHe was in hospital for 18 months and I filmed with him during his last week in hospital before he came home. \nI was nervous about meeting him because I was worried about saying the wrong thing but he instantly put me at ease with his smile, humour and positivity. And that mental strength he has used ever since to change the way people view disability and to shake up the disability world, changing and saving hundreds of lives. \nHe has an incredible ability to know what people need. \nI have seen people take their first steps at his centre and seen him take people from a dark place and transform their lives, proving that you can have a full and incredible life after a spinal injury \u2013 Getting Busy Living.",

        "article_text": "SpaceX has launched a rocket carrying a new crew to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of a plan to bring astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams home.\nThe pair were due to be on the ISS for only eight days, but because of technical issues with the experimental spacecraft they came on, they have been there for more than nine months.\nThe astronauts are due to begin their journey back to Earth two days after the new crew arrives. Steve Stich, manager of Nasa's commercial crew programme said he was delighted at the prospect.\n\"Butch and Suni have done a great job and we are excited to bring them back,\" he said.\nThe astronauts, along with their ISS workmates, Nasa's Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, will be relieved by four astronauts, from Russia, Japan and two from the US.\nThere will be a two-day handover after which the old crew are due to begin their journey back to Earth. But there could be a small further delay, as they wait for conditions on Earth to be right for a safe re-entry of the returning capsule, according to Dana Weigel, manager, of the ISS programme.\n\"Weather always has to cooperate, so we'll take our time over that if it is not favourable,\" she told reporters.\nMs Weigel explained that the astronauts had begun getting ready for the handover last week.\n\"Butch rang a ceremonial bell as Suni handed over command to cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin,\" she said.\nThe astronauts have consistently said that they have been happy to be on board the space station, with Suni Williams describing it as her \"happy place\". But Dr Simeon Barber, of the Open University, told BBC News that there would likely have been a personal cost.\n\"When you are sent on a work trip that is supposed to last a week, you are not expecting it to take the best part of a year,\" he said.\n\"This extended stay in space will have disrupted family life, things will have happened back home that they will have missed out on, so there will have been a period of upheaval.\"\nButch and Suni arrived at the ISS at the beginning of June 2024 to test an experimental spacecraft called Starliner, which was built by the aerospace firm Boeing, a rival to SpaceX. \nThe mission had been delayed by several years because of technical issues in the spacecraft's development, and there were problems during its launch and docking on to the ISS. This included issues with some of Starliner's thrusters, which would be needed to slow the spacecraft for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, and leaks of helium gas in the propulsion system.\nNasa decided that it would not take even a small risk in bringing back Butch and Suni on Starliner, when they had the option of returning them on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Nasa decided the best option was to do this during a scheduled crew rotation, even though it would mean keeping the astronauts on the space station for several months.\nBoeing has consistently argued that it would have been safe to bring Butch and Suni back on Starliner, and were unhappy about the decision to use a rival's capsule instead, which will be \"embarrassing\" for Boeing, according to Dr Barber.\n\"It's not a good look for Boeing to see astronauts they took into space come back in a competitor's craft.\"\nBoth President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have said that Butch and Suni could have been brought home sooner, most recently in a joint interview with Fox News in February.\nPresident Trump states: \"They got left in space.\"\nWhen the interviewer,  Sean Hannity, elaborates, saying \"They were supposed to be there eight days. They're there almost 300,\" Mr Trump responds with one word: \"Biden.\" Mr Musk follows up asserting: \"They were left up there for political reasons.\"\nThe assertion is denied by Nasa's Steve Stitch.\n\"We looked at a wide range of options and worked hand-in-hand with SpaceX to look at what was the best thing to do overall and when we laid all that out the best option was to have the one we are embarking upon,\" he said.\nThat decision was supported by Dr Libby Jackson, who is head of space at the Science Museum in London and worked at Europe's control centre for the ISS.\n\"Butch and Suni's wellbeing would always have been at the very forefront of everybody's minds as the decisions were being made for how best to deal with the circumstances that they were presented,\" she said.\n\"Nasa made those decisions based on good technical reasons, on programmatic reasons, and found the right solution that has kept Butch and Suni safe.\n\"I really look forward to seeing them return to Earth, safe and sound, along with the rest of their crewmates.\"",

        "article_text": "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page, Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It\u2019s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino\u2019s Blue Lagoon is a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay\u2019s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds, protesting what they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n\u2022\u00a0 The summer that tourism fell apart\n\u2022\u00a0 Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of commercial operations at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap \u2013 reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations to combat overtourism. Venice has introduced entry fees for day-trippers, while Athens has capped daily visitor numbers to the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump says \"many elements\" of a peace agreement in Ukraine have been agreed with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, ahead of their much anticipated phone call.\nTrump posted on Truth Social that he will speak with Putin on Tuesday morning.\nHe said that while there have been agreements, \"much remains\" to be worked upon.\n\"Each week brings 2,500 soldier deaths, from both sides, and it must end NOW. I look very much forward to the call with President Putin,\" Trump wrote.\nHe earlier told reporters that \"we're going to see if we can work a peace agreement, a ceasefire and peace, and I think we'll be able to do it\".\nIn his nightly address on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Putin of prolonging the war.\n\"This proposal could have been implemented long ago,\" he said, adding that \"every day in wartime means human lives\".\nThere have been inconsistencies from within the Trump administration over how advanced the ceasefire talks are. \nSpeaking after his meeting in Jeddah with Ukrainian officials, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the \"bulk\" of the conversation had been \"what a negotiation process would look like\" and not \"the specific conditions\".\nUS envoy Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin on Thursday in Moscow, has also struck a more measured tone. \nMeanwhile, the UK and France have urged Putin to prove he wants a peace deal with Ukraine.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron hailed the \"courage\" of Zelenksy in agreeing to a ceasefire proposal, and challenged Russia to do the same.\n\"Enough deaths. Enough lives destroyed. Enough destruction. The guns must fall silent,\" Macron said in a post on X.\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Putin should agree to a \"full and unconditional ceasefire now\", telling MPs he had seen \"no sign\" that Putin was serious about a peace deal.\nHe warned that the UK and its allies have \"more cards that we can play\" to help force Russia to negotiate \"seriously\".\nThe White House sounded a more upbeat note on the eve of the Trump-Putin talks, which will take place by phone, saying peace in Ukraine has \"never been closer\".\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that Trump was \"determined\" to secure the peace deal.\nOn what the talks might cover, she said: \"There's a power plant that is on the border of Russia and Ukraine that was up for discussion with the Ukrainians, and he will address it in his call with Putin tomorrow.\"\nThe facility is likely to be the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, and fears of a nuclear accident have persisted due to fighting in the area.\nAsked on Sunday what concessions were being considered in the ceasefire negotiations, Trump said: \"We'll be talking about land. We'll be talking about power plants [...] We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.\"\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on what the leaders would discuss, responding, \"we never do that\". \nWhile Putin has previously said he supports a ceasefire, he also set out a list of conditions for achieving peace.\nOne of the areas of contention is Russia's Western Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a military incursion last August and captured some territory.\nRussia had pushed to recapture it in recent weeks, and Putin now claims it is fully back in control of Kursk.\nHe has also raised numerous questions about how a ceasefire could be monitored and policed along the frontline in the east, and has said he would not accept Nato troops on the territory.\nThe peace proposal on the table was discussed by Ukrainian and American delegates in Saudi Arabia last week.\nAfter hours locked away in a room, they announced proposals for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine said it was ready to accept.\nFrance's President Macron and newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who met on Tuesday, stressed their nations would continue their  \"unwavering\" support of Ukraine and demand \"clear commitments\" from Russia.

        "article_text": "Tens of thousands of people have descended on Serbia's capital to protest against the deaths of 15 people in a railway station collapse.\nThe government has put attendance at 107,000 across Belgrade. Organisers and independent monitors have yet to give their estimates. \nEither way, it probably ranks as the largest demonstration Serbia has ever seen.\nThe Novi Sad collapse last November has galvanised anger towards the government and President Aleksandar Vucic. Demonstrators blame corruption and corner-cutting for the loss of life.\nThey believe the disaster reflects more than a decade of governing by the Progressive Party of Vucic - who closely associated himself with the station's recent renovation.\nDespite multiple resignations - and Vucic's insistence that he is going nowhere - the protests have only continued to grow.\n\"We just want a country that works,\" law student Jana Vasic told the BBC in the growing crowd in Belgrade.\n\"We want institutions that do their jobs properly. We don't care what party is in power. But we need a country that works, not one where you don't get justice for more than four months.\"\nRepublic Square - just one of the four meeting points around Serbia's capital for the \"15th for 15\" protest - was full to overflowing on Saturday.\nSome took refuge on the plinth of Prince Mihajlo's statue - the traditional spot for Belgraders to meet, the equivalent of Eros in London's Piccadilly. \nOthers queued up along the road in front of the National Museum, stretching all the way back to Students' Square.\nThe other meeting points were every bit as crowded ahead of the planned rendezvous in front of the National Assembly.\nWhile the protests over the Novi Sad collapse began with students, they have been joined by taxi drivers, farmers and lawyers.\nAhead of the big protest, motorbike riders pulled up outside the National Assembly, facing off against the tractors surrounding a camp of pro-government counter-protesters. \nThen a parade of military veterans received a rousing welcome. They said they would make a citizen's arrest on anyone who attacked the students.\nThe students have been calling for full transparency and accountability over the collapse of a concrete and glass canopy at the station in Serbia's second city, which was renovated and only reopened - by Vucic - in 2022.\nThey want the government to publish all the documentation relating to the renovation project and say they are not satisfied with the papers the authorities have released so far.\nThey also want those responsible for the disaster to be charged and convicted. Prosecutors have indicted at least 16 people, including former construction minister Goran Vesic. \nBut the charges have yet to go to trial. And the students insist they will continue with their protests until the authorities meet all their demands.\n\"We're making progress,\" a student representing Belgrade University's philosophy faculty told the BBC. \"But at this point none of our demands have been met completely.\"\n\"A couple of politicians have resigned from their offices,\" noted another. \"But they weren't fired. We're yet to see anything but empty promises\".\nPrime Minister Milos Vucevic announced his resignation at the end of January. But that has yet to be ratified by the National Assembly and he remains in his post.\nBut the real power in Serbia lies with Vucic, who insists that he is going nowhere.\n\"I don't give in to blackmail,\" he told a media conference on the eve of the big protest. \"I won't allow the street to pave a horrible future for this country.\"\nVucic described the student protests as \"well-intentioned\". But he had less flattering words for opposition parties, labelling them members of a \"criminal cartel\". He accused them of attempting to force the formation of a \"fraudulent interim government\".\nBorko Stefanovic does not deny that the opposition parties are looking for the establishment of a \"government of experts\".\nThe deputy president of the Party of Freedom and Justice describes it as the \"only rational way out\" of the political crisis, which would establish the conditions for fresh elections. \nLike other opposition leaders, Stefanovic says that free elections are not currently possible due to the Progressive Party's domination of the media and state institutions.\nBut this is not one of the students' demands. They are simply calling for the truth behind the Novi Sad disaster to be established.\nAs law professor Miodrag Jovanovic puts it \"they are asking for the things I've been lecturing about - the rule of law, respect for the constitution, and the responsibility and accountability of public officials\".\nWhatever happens during the \"15th for 15\" protest, it seems unlikely that the students will relent until they receive some satisfactory answers.",

        "article_text": "Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic \u2013 and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\nWhen Tadas Eidukevi\u010dius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.\nOfficial decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around a third of those challenges are ultimately upheld at an independent tribunal.\n\"Britain's chequered history of benefit reform shows that the government should proceed cautiously, rather than rush ahead to find savings which could backfire,\" says Louise Murphy of the Resolution Foundation.\nAnother way for the government to try to achieve savings is by encouraging more people to come off these benefits and enter work.\nAround 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.\nOne potential route to increase employment rates could be regular reassessments of people in receipt of incapacity benefit and a requirement for them to start looking for jobs if they are found to be fit for work.\nThe fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.\nHowever, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work and could also create unexpected distortions in the system.\nThe OBR has suggested the sanctions introduced to the wider benefits system by the last government, requiring people judged fit to work to be actively looking for employment or risk losing their benefits, had the counterproductive effect of increasing the incentive for people to try to claim incapacity benefits (for which these work-searching requirements did not apply).\nAnother potential policy avenue to boost employment rates is through providing much greater support to find jobs.\nSome advocate increasing government investment in official schemes, working with employers, to help people to enter the workplace.\nThere have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.\nEvaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.\nHowever, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.\nThat implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.\nNevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.\n\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

        "article_text": "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in on Friday. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.\nMark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.\nHe had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.\nBut unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. \nBut holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect Carney to call it soon after he is sworn in.\nAlthough Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.\nWith three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.\nThe son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. \nIn 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs. \n\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race. \n\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"\nIn 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.\nIn 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.\nAlthough central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. \nThat move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.\nHe is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.\nIn 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.\nInterest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.\nConfusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.\nUnlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.\nIn 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.\nBefore the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.\nIn the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.\nHe described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.\nThe Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.\nHis final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\". \nCarney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.\nFrom 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.\nHe was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.\nAlthough he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.\nAfter Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.\n\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said. \n\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"\nHe seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".\nThe Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.\n\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.\nThings changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.\nReports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.\nFreeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.\n\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\" \nStill, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. \nThe Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.\nThey have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. \nHis team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.\nIn addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.\nHe is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.\nOne of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.\nShortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.\nOn immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.\nHis biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US. \nThere are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.

        "article_text": "The live-action version of the classic fairy-tale animation sounded like a surefire hit. But even before it's reached cinemas, the response to it has been loud and often hostile.\nYou wouldn't think that the war in Gaza would have much impact on a Disney remake. But the live-action Snow White, a revamped version of the 1937 animated classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, has become a flashpoint for social and political divisions, even before its global release next week. \u00a0\nThere was some backlash to the casting of Rachel Zegler, of Colombian descent, as the heroine. More recently, there has been blowback both about Zegler's pro-Palestinian comments and about pro-Israel comments by Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen. And there is an ongoing debate about whether there should have been dwarfs at all, live or CGI. The film's director, Marc Webb, said in Disney's official production notes, \"I think all good stories evolve over time. They become reflections of the world that we live in\". He has likely got more than he bargained for, as reactions to Snow White inadvertently reflect the most polarised aspects of the world today. Like political rhetoric in countries around the world, responses to the film's production have been loud, irate and sometimes ugly.\nSnow White has been in the works since 2019, and began in earnest with Zegler's casting in 2021. Since then attacks on its so-called \"wokeness\" have proliferated, making the film a lightning rod for opinions that have little to do with the fairy tale it is based on. A recent Hollywood Reporter article asked, \"Have some PR missteps combined with anti-woke outrage turned marketing the film into a poisoned apple?\" And alongside such measured reporting there have been heated responses in the media. The editorial board of the New York Post \u2013 owned by Rupert Murdoch, the conservative mogul whose company also owns Fox News \u2013 weighed in this week, declaring the film a financial disaster before it has opened, writing: \"Disney 'Snow White' controversy proves it again: Go woke, go broke!\"\nThe original film needed an update if it was going to be remade at all. In its day it set a high bar for Disney's future animated films, but it also introduced the song Someday My Prince Will Come, blighting the expectations of generations of girls by setting them up to wait for a Prince Charming to make their lives complete. Meanwhile, Snow White happily sweeps the floor for the dwarfs until he shows up to rescue her with a kiss after she bites the Queen's poisoned apple. Soon after her casting announcement, Zegler told the television show Extra that in the old Snow White \"there was a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her\". In fact, the original film states that he \"searched far and wide\" to find her after falling in love at first sight, and he disappears for most of the film, so no need to take that comment too seriously. Zegler was excited and laughing when she said it. But in an early sign of the blinkered reactions to come, social media posts complained that she was anti-love.\nSome people also rejected the idea that a Latina actress could play a character called Snow White; alongside criticisms of such non-traditional casting, she was subject to racist trolling. This was a similar reaction to that experienced by the black actress Halle Bailey when she was cast as Ariel in 2023's The Little Mermaid.\nThe film stumbled into more trouble simply because its lead actresses expressed political opinions. On X in August 2024, Zegler thanked fans for the response to the Snow White trailer, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".\nGadot has posted her support for Israel on social media, and especially since the 7 October attacks by Hamas has been outspoken in defence of her country and against anti-semitism. That led to some short-lived calls by pro-Palestinian social media users to boycott the film simply because she is in it.\nThe fallout on the film intensified after the 2024 US presidential election. Zegler posted on Instagram that she was \"heartbroken\" and fearful, and that she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\". In response Megyn Kelly, the former Fox news personality, attacked Zegler, saying on her radio show, \"This woman is a pig,\" and that Disney was going to have to recast the role. Zegler apologised to Trump voters, saying \"I let my emotions get the best of me\".\nEven when people reacting to the film have agreed on a basic principle, like more opportunities for actors who have dwarfism, they have disagreed on how to get there. Peter Dinklage, perhaps the world's most well-known actor with dwarfism, questioned the entire project before many details were known, calling the 1937 film \"a backwards story of seven dwarfs living in a cave together\". Disney announced the next day, \"To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters.\"\nAs it turned out, the seven characters are CGI, and Disney has reclassifed them as \"magical creatures\", not dwarfs. What do they look like? Even a glimpse at the trailer reveals that they look exactly like CGI dwarfs. They are still named Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Bashful and Dopey.\nThe changes have caused a backlash from some people with dwarfism, who have rebutted Dinklage and accused Disney of depriving them of acting roles. As recently as this week, one told the Daily Mail, \"I think Disney is trying too hard to be politically correct, but in doing so it's damaging our careers and opportunities.\" \nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a010 of the best films to watch this March\n\u2022\u00a0The real meaning of Wicked\n\u2022\u00a0Why Disney had a hard centenary year\nAmidst this swirl of controversies, Disney altered the traditional red-carpet treatment it would usually give such a major film. The premiere took place in Spain on 12 March, and the Los Angeles premiere is due to take place today at an unusual, afternoon hour. The regular red-carpet journalists have not been invited, even though as a group they are not known to ask hard-hitting questions.\nTrying to avoid more political and social discord isn't Disney's only Snow White problem, though. There is much online speculation that the film might just be bad. The first full trailer was greeted with a rush of complaints about the underwhelming CGI, with The Guardian calling the trailer \"the ugliest thing ever committed to screen\". The film has new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the team behind La La Land, but the one released as a video, Waiting On a Wish, has a bland, generic Disney style. Box-office tracking predicts an opening weekend of around $50m (\u00a339m), solid but at the low end for a would-be blockbuster that reportedly cost over $200m (\u00a3155m) to make.\nOf course, given the Disney juggernaut \u2013 the recent Moana 2 has made more than $1bn (\u00a3773m) and Mufasa: The Lion King, which had a slow start, more than $712m (\u00a3550m) \u2013 the debacle leading up to Snow White's opening may not hurt it at the box office at all.\nOr the film may become the victim of its moment, a fairy-tale princess covered in mud.\u00a0\nSnow White is released internationally on March 21\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

But that doesn't mean it will flop.\nFilm critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.\nIt is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".\nPaste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".\nThere have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".\nBut overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix. It would make The Electric State the most expensive streaming film ever.\nCritics' opinions, however, have become more irrelevant in the streaming age. The bad reviews didn't stop The Electric State from going straight to number one on Netflix's chart after its release on Friday. \nIt fits into Netflix making star-packed, entertaining and escapist movies that often get panned by reviewers - but are watched by hundreds of millions of subscribers.\n\"I would love to say that what I've written and what other critics have written will matter, but I just don't think it will,\" says Digital Spy movies editor Ian Sandwell.\nSandwell awarded the film two stars out of five, noting that the action and visual effects are \"decent\", the robots are \"impressive\" and the finale is \"epic\".\n\"My main problem was they'd created this really impressive, visually spectacular world and then just told quite a generic seen-it-all-before story inside it,\" he says.\nBad reviews might have put people off paying to see the film if it had been released in cinemas, he says. \"But on Netflix, I think it will still be absolutely massive. I don't think bad reviews will matter at all.\"\nWhile a critic's job is to a analyse a movie, \"audiences probably do just want a big, spectacular blockbuster to watch at home, with two massive stars\", he adds.\nThe Electric State follows Brown, Pratt and a succession of zany robots in an alternative version of 1990s America, where there has been a war between humans and intelligent bots.\nIt also stars Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci and the voices of Woody Harrelson and Brian Cox, and is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo - who have made four Marvel movies, including the wildly successful Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame.\nThe Electric State is based on the graphic novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, although some critics pointed out that Netflix had missed the book's point about the perils of a consumerist society addicted to technology.\nThe film is \"absolutely not\" value for money in terms of quality, says City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford.\nAnd it remains to be seen whether the film makes financial sense for Netflix, she says.\nThe streaming giant's most popular ever film, 2021's Red Notice, has had 231 million views, according to Netflix's measurements. \n\"The Electric State will be hoping for that kind of performance, just as a $320m theatrically released movie would be aiming to break box office records,\" Luxford says.\n\"The higher the price, the higher the target for success, even with a business model as opaque as Netflix's.\"\nRed Notice, an action-packed art crime caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds, has a lukewarm 39% critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes - but a 92% audience rating.\nOther recent Netflix hits have been lapped up by viewers more than reviewers.\nBrooke Shields' lightweight multi-generational rom-com Mother of the Bride has a 13% critics' score, Jennifer Lopez's AI action thriller Atlas is on 19%, Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx's family spy escapade Back In Action has 29%, and Kevin Hart's heist comedy Lift is on 30%.\nThey are enjoyable but forgettable - and easy to watch in the midst of potential distractions at home. The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.\nIn December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".\n\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.\n\"But it does depend on the movie.\"\nNetflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.\nAnother critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.\n\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.\n\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.\n\"And it just feels like really, really bad value for money at that point.\"",

Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park. He is included in Carsley's England Under-21 side.\nTottenham defender Djed Spence will have had his backers, while there is no place for Conor Gallagher despite his fine form at Atletico Madrid.\nTuchel resisted the temptation to include Arsenal 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, who also goes into Carsley's squad.\nThis video can not be played\nHow Grealish needs 'confidence and love'\nThomas Tuchel gave a hugely impressive performance in front of the media after announcing his first squad.\nFrom suggestion he is intent on \"building a brotherhood\" in his England squad to talking about \"a parental vibe\" when handling Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tuchel was confident and comfortable in his new skin as England head coach.\nNo subject was off limits, apart from when he declined to reveal who his captain might be if Harry Kane was not available.\nTuchel was open, honest and clearly excited about the task ahead, although he admitted he was \"missing the smell of the grass\" and could not wait to get on the training ground with his new charges.\nThis is a coach who has been around the block with big clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Paris St. Germain and Bayern Munich, while getting a feel and admiration for the English game and his players at Chelsea.\nHe is the quick winner the FA wanted with his appointment.\nNow the serious work starts with the World Cup his goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRashford returns as Tuchel names first England squad",

        "article_text": "Wynton Marsalis made history when he became the first musician to win classical and jazz Grammy Awards in the same year. He tells the BBC's Katty Kay about jazz's unique connection to liberation and how his father's relationship with music shaped his approach.\nLegendary musician Wynton Marsalis is no stranger to making history. But as he brings his one-of-a-kind blend of classical and jazz to audiences everywhere, he's reflecting on history, too.\nDuring an appearance on Influential with Katty Kay, Marsalis shares that every time he plays, he understands that he's bringing his family's legacy into the spotlight with him. Born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1961, the 63-year-old star was surrounded by performers from the start. His father, Ellis Marsalis Jr, was a jazz pianist and his mother, Dolores Marsalis, a singer.\u00a0\n\"I did not want to be famous. I wanted to learn how to play. My standard was my father and all the musicians that I grew up respecting and loving,\" Marsalis tells Kay, between showing off his trumpet and playing her a few bars. His humility is tinged with a signature sense of humour. He tells Kay that at first he didn't want to play the instrument that would make him famous. \"I did not want to play trumpet because I did not want to get that ring around my lips. I figured the girls would not kiss you.\"\nAs the first musician \u2013 and still the only one \u2013 to win a Grammy Award in classical and jazz categories in the same year, Marsalis is open about the ways he jumps between genres to create something true to himself. He credits his unique blend to growing up in the American South during segregation and witnessing change firsthand.\nAfter he began to take music more seriously at the age of 12, he would go on to become the only black musician in the New Orleans Civic Orchestra, and played with the New Orleans Philharmonic. That early success was jarring to someone who saw his father struggle. While he'd played on some of the biggest stages in his hometown, Marsalis was unsure that had the chops to compete with professional musicians in the wider field.\u00a0\n\"I had to step back and recalibrate, like what am I going to be able to do? Am I going to be good enough to actually play jazz? That is what I wanted to play. I wanted to be a jazz musician, but it was so few people playing the type of jazz I wanted to play,\" Marsalis says.\nOnce Marsalis joined the prestigious New York City music school Julliard aged 17, he was surrounded by a whole new group of performers \u2013 and introduced to new styles of music. As he found his footing in the musical scene, he also found a passion for social justice. He notes that being outspoken seemed to come just as naturally as the trumpet.\n\"I was shaped by growing up in segregation and having to be integrated into schools where you were not necessarily wanted. You were not wanted,\" he says. \"I was post-civil rights. So, I was speaking about things that people do not speak about, and I was also very serious about those things.\"\u00a0\nLater, he would sign a contract with Colombia Records after shifting his focus from classical music to jazz \u2013 thanks in part to touring with Herbie Hancock and the Art Blakey band in Europe. Through it all, he felt jazz in everything he experienced. Touring, not a formal education, would be the thing to show him that his style of music and performing mattered.\u00a0\n\"Anything that has a harmonic progression and a melody, you can hear jazz in,\" he says.\nMarsalis notes that, unlike other genres, jazz makes its performers work together without any singular voice dominating. Instead of stealing the spotlight, jazz musicians must find a balance.\n\"Sometimes, you do not like what people are doing because you do not understand what they are doing. Sometimes, you do not like what they are doing because you want to control everything that goes on. That's not what our music is. We are playing together,\" he says.\nThis, too, is the throughline he sees between jazz and social justice. When everyone commits to a common cause, whether its racial equality or musical harmony, it takes leaving egos out of the equation.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"Our music is serious because it liberates people. But it is very difficult to learn how to play and to play well, because it requires you to be in balance with somebody else. That is a hard thing to want to be,\" he says.\nReflecting on what he's doing to help the musicians following in his storied footsteps, Marsalis is straightforward about his approach. He wants to be whom he hoped to have as he rose in the ranks.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Wendell Pierce on black resilience in America\n\u2022\u00a0Earvin 'Magic' Johnson on the 1992 Olympic Dream Team: 'It was the best moment of my life'\n\u2022\u00a0'I don't open restaurants, I tell stories': Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s on his singular approach to food\n\"I try not to make the mistakes I feel all the musicians made towards me when I was younger,\" he says, of mentoring others. Jazz, Marsalis notes, is not a place for one-upmanship.\n\"Jazz is the opposite of all that. We will elevate you. Let me share my space with you. Let me be quiet and let you talk. Let me leave space for your soul,\" he says.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

I can't describe it in one word.\n\"I have been waiting for this a long, long time. Scoring a goal and we get the win, it's amazing.\"\nNouwen was solid in the defence throughout a must-win game as the Eagles eked out only a second league win of the season.\nThe crucial success moved Leif Smerud's side a point behind second-bottom Villa with six games left.\nBottom club Palace beat WSL relegation rivals Villa\n'Many ways to hunt' - Palace's fight for WSL survival\nWith Leicester City, third bottom and just three points ahead, also now within touching distance, Nouwen acknowledged the significance of the win under Palace new manager Smerud.\n\"We see now we are fighting for everything - the team really came together,\" she added.\n\"We are losing a lot of players to injuries but what we do now is we keep fighting. It doesn't matter who is playing, who is missing. We keep fighting.\n\"We know we can do it now and we know we can fight for it.\"\nPalace's resilience was on full display against Villa.\nTheir defence has looked solid in in narrow losses to Liverpool in the league and Chelsea in the FA Cup since Smerud took charge.\nWith Nouwen returning to feature at the heart of the defence, they negotiated a fast start from Villa, before growing into the game and adding further goals from Ashleigh Weerden and Katie Stengel, with Lucy Parker replying for the visitors.\nSmerud praised Nouwen as he said: \"The way she came into the game with the time she has been out tells you everything about her.\n\"She is a great player, calm, and strong mentally as well.\"\nLeif Smerud joined Crystal Palace this month after Laura Kaminski was sacked\nIt has not been an easy start to life at Palace for Norwegian tactician Smerud, who will be relieved to have opened his win account in the crunch meeting.\n\"We knew it was going to be a game with a lot of pressure going into it and I'm impressed by how we handled that pressure,\" he added.\n\"I love these games but I knew the players were going to be a bit nervous and I think we handled it really well. To come out of it after a big fight, especially in the second half, is fantastic. We are ready to go again soon.\"\nSmerud has not only made their defence organised but improved their attacking output - all while handling a growing list of injuries. \nAmong the seven substitutes named by Smerud against Villa were three academy players - Tecla Ezeh, Hope Thompson and Rosie Rowe - featuring in the first-team squad for the very first time. \nStill, their seven shots on target on Sunday were the most they had registered in a league game this season, as Weerden, Stengel and Clarissa Larisey all contributed up front.\n\"In football you have to work with the reality, that is why it's difficult sometimes. We had very few players available this week,\" Smerud said.  \n\"It's about working together, no matter how difficult it is. You need to stick together and our group did that.\"\nThe Eagles will next visit Everton, in eighth place and seven points ahead, on Saturday.\nSmerud added: \"We will celebrate this win because it is really deserved and it's important to celebrate. But from tomorrow, we prepare Everton, we recover and we continue doing what we are doing. \n\"We have a job to do still and we are going to do it.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Lewis Hamilton is starting his 19th season in Formula 1\nAustralian Grand Prix\nVenue: Albert Park, Melbourne Date: Sunday, 16 March Race start: 04:00 GMT\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 03:30. Live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nThere was no fairytale for Lewis Hamilton on his first competitive outing for Ferrari, as Formula 1's most celebrated driver began his career with the sport's most iconic team.\nThe seven-time world champion qualified only eighth for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - one place and 0.218 seconds slower than his team-mate Charles Leclerc, and a whopping 0.877secs behind Lando Norris' McLaren on pole position.\nAfterwards, Hamilton was repeating the mantra he has been using for some time - that it is going to take a little time before he is fully up to speed with his new car and team.\n\"For me, just improving every single lap, session on session,\" he said. \"Big learning curve this weekend.\n\"The car was so much different than I have ever experienced here and it's been a lot slower process to build confidence in the car.\n\"In the high-speed [corners], I have been down all weekend to Charles, who has had confidence from the get-go. He knew what the car does. I was just building up to that. I got a lot closer in the end and to be that close to Charles in my first qualifying session against a great qualifier...\"\nNorris takes Melbourne pole with Hamilton eighth\nAustralian Grand Prix Qualifying Review\nHe didn't complete the sentence, but the meaning was clear - Leclerc is blindingly fast; everyone knows that. So from Hamilton's point of view, in terms of his own relative performance, this was a perfectly decent start.\nThe same could not be said of Ferrari themselves. Hamilton is at Ferrari with one objective only - to win an eighth world title. Leclerc himself spoke on Thursday about winning a championship with Ferrari being his \"obsession\". Neither will achieve their aims with a car that qualifies on the fourth row of the grid.\nLeclerc was perplexed by what had happened. He had been quick all weekend, and fourth fastest in the first qualifying session, just over 0.1secs off Norris, who topped all three. But it became progressively worse as the hour developed.\n\"As soon as we started to push the car more and more,\" Leclerc said, \"we found more and more inconsistency, which was a bit of a shame.\n\"We lost the pace a little bit through qualifying. In Q1 we were good, in Q2 we were less good and in Q3 we had to push a lot to try and nail the lap time. We didn't really follow the track for some reason.\n\"This car has a lot of potential but for now we don't seem to be in the right window, so we have to find it.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBig surprises & how will Hamilton do?: BBC 5 Live team share 2025 predictions\nIt was a sobering start to a season that all in F1 had expected to start with Ferrari as McLaren's closest challenger. But not everyone felt it was necessarily a reflection of the team's true potential.\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"I am certainly surprised at the gap between McLaren and Ferrari. But I would say more, I just don't take that gap at face value.\n\"I'm sure the potential of the red car is higher than for some reasons was possible to exploit today. I think we have seen that until possibly qualifying in every single session, even in Bahrain [at pre-season testing].\n\"So we are very realistic that Ferrari is definitely one of the main contenders.\"\nLando Norris has spent his entire F1 career with McLaren since making his debut in 2019\nHamilton at Ferrari - his personal quest for success, and the internal battle with Leclerc - is one of the dominant narratives at the start of this season.\nAnother is whether Norris can deliver on his ambition to mount a season-long title challenge from the off, rather than having to play catch-up - which he had to try to do last year because McLaren did not start on Red Bull's level.\nIn the end in Melbourne, McLaren did deliver on their potential, but not without a few scary moments.\nFacing a tougher challenge from Red Bull and Max Verstappen than they - and the four-time champion himself - had expected, Norris and Oscar Piastri both made mistakes on their first laps in the final part of qualifying.\nThat put them under pressure on their last runs - lacking a competitive first lap always makes finding the right balance of risk and reward on that all-important final lap much more difficult, because the penalty of making a mistake is so much greater.\nFor home favourite Piastri, this was bad enough - he was fourth after his first run. Norris, though, was 10th, having had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits.\nBoth absolutely nailed it. Piastri, hoping to become the first Australian to win his home grand prix in F1, improved by a second, knocking Verstappen from the top, and Norris did even better, pipping his team-mate by 0.084secs.\nNorris said. \"It's a track where you've got to commit. You know what your target is, and once you turn in you're kind of hoping for the best in a lot of cases. You want to take those risks.\n\"Obviously, I took too many on my first lap and got track limits, so I was in a difficult position knowing how much risk I wanted to take. But I put it together well. It was just a clean lap, no mistakes, and that was enough. So happy. A perfect way to start the season.\"\nMcLaren ended last year with their first constructors' championship title for 26 years, and Stella has said they have taken some risks with \"innovative\" design in pushing for more performance from a car that was the fastest in the field for the second half of last year.\nAlthough all the teams arrived in Melbourne expecting them to be at the front, Norris on Thursday described the idea they might be a chunk ahead of the rest as \"short-sighted\".\nIn the end, at least on the quick, demanding street circuit of Albert Park, he was the one who had to recalibrate.\n\"It really was not necessarily our expectation to have a bit of a gap to the rest of the cars,\" Norris said, before pointing to the fact that the errors they made were due to the difficulty in nailing a lap in a car that has taken the team to new heights.\n\"The car is extremely quick. And when you put it together, it's unbelievable. It's just difficult to put it together. So really it was like a little fight between me and Oscar today, and it was a tough one.\"\nMax Verstappen retired with a brake failure after just four laps of last year's race in Melbourne\nVerstappen might have been pleasantly surprised to be best of the rest, but the 0.385secs margin between him and Norris, while perhaps expected, will have been less palatable.\nFor his team, though, there are concerns on more than one level. On top of the apparent gap to McLaren, there was the performance of their new recruit Liam Lawson.\nAfter paying off Sergio Perez to leave just seven months after being given a new two-year contract, the last thing Red Bull will have wanted to see was Lawson more than 0.6secs off Verstappen on the first day's practice.\nLawson was then hit with an engine problem that robbed him of the entire final session on Saturday. In that context, it was no surprise that he should struggle in qualifying.\nEven so, a first lap a second off Verstappen, and a mistake on his second - putting him on to the grass and down in 18th on the grid - was not a good start.\nLawson is two places behind 18-year-old Italian Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Hamilton's replacement at Mercedes. Antonelli, who will become the third youngest driver to start an F1 race on Sunday, had his qualifying compromised by damage to the floor of his car. The other Mercedes of George Russell will start alongside Verstappen in fourth.\nThere was an impressive performance from another rookie, Gabriel Bortoleto in the Sauber, a bad start to his first full season for Haas' British novice Oliver Bearman, and promise from Fernando Alonso in the Aston Martin that was not delivered when an off in the second session damaged his floor.\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nMany would want a straightforward first race of the season. But Albert Park has a habit of throwing up curveballs, and it seems the weather may oblige on Sunday, with rain predicted.\n\"It's a new car,\" Norris said. \"So there are a lot of unknowns and question marks about how it will perform. It's not always as simple as just putting on wets and having a crack.\n\"A bit of our pace potentially goes out of the window because it's harder to extract and show the difference of pace we had today. But we're in the best position to do that if we can. I know the chances of rain have been going down, but normally wet races and inter races are pretty exciting.\"\nWhat he did not mention is that the rain brings Verstappen - who would not expect to match the McLarens in a dry race - right into the picture.\nStella was less reticent.\n\"The only thing I can say about Max in the wet is that he is mega,\" he said. \"He can be a significant threat.\"\nHamilton, too, has made a reputation for being special when it rains. But his circumstances mean he will not be treating it with the usual smile.\n\"The wet has often been something I have enjoyed,\" Hamilton said. \"So it's a comfort zone for me but I am going out for the first time in the wet in an uncomfortable position because I have never driven this car.\n\"It is going to be a shock to the system when I first get out there, but I will be learning on the fly and giving it everything.\"\nBritish driver Nigel Mansell won his first race for Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix.

        "article_text": "US immigration authorities have announced the arrest of a second activist who participated in pro-Palestinian protests last spring at Columbia University in New York City.\nLeqaa Kordia, who is a Palestinian and from the West Bank, was arrested in New Jersey, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement on Friday.\nThe statement said another student, Ranjani Srinivasani, who has Indian citizenship, chose to \"self-deport\" by leaving the US earlier this week.\nThis follows the arrest of Columbia campus activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained on Saturday in New York before being flown to a jail in Louisiana.\nThe DHS statement says that Ms Kordia had overstayed her student visa, which had been terminated in 2022 \"for lack of attendance\". It did not say whether she had been attending Columbia or another institution. \nShe had previously been arrested in April 2024 for taking part in protests at Columbia University, according to DHS. \nMs Srinivasan, a doctoral student in Urban Planning at Columbia University, had her visa revoked on 5 March.\n\"It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a statement.\n\"When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.\"\nMs Srinivasan's lawyer Ramzi Kassem told the Wall Street Journal that the government's statement was \"full of the falsehoods we've come to expect of DHS\".\nMr Kassem told the paper the government \"violated basic rights\" by revoking a visa \"simply for engaging in protected political speech\".\nThe BBC contacted a lawyer for Ms Srinivasan for comment on Friday evening. \nContact details for Mr Kodia's lawyer were not Immediately available. \nUS President Donald Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. \nThe president argues these protesters should be deported.\nMr Khalil, 30, is a Syrian-born Columbia graduate and US green card holder. \nHis case has raised questions about free speech on college campuses and the legal process that would allow for the deportation of a US permanent resident.\nHis lawyers say he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. \nMr Khalil's lawyers deny that he supports Hamas.\nAdditionally, on Thursday night DHS agents executed two search warrants in rooms on the Columbia campus.\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche of the US justice department said the agents were searching for evidence that the university was \"harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus\".  \n\"That investigation is ongoing, and we are also looking at whether Columbia's handling of earlier incidents violated civil rights laws and included terrorism crimes,\" he said.\nColumbia Interim President Katrina Armstrong said in a letter to the campus that she was \"heartbroken\" to inform them of the federal raid.\n\"No one was arrested or detained.

Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation?US President Donald Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. Ms Srinivasan, a doctoral student in Urban Planning at Columbia University, had her visa revoked on 5 March. Mr Khalil's lawyers deny that he supports Hamas.Additionally, on Thursday night DHS agents executed two search warrants in rooms on the Columbia campus.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche of the US justice department said the agents were searching for evidence that the university was \"harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus\".

It's also home to over a million cows, which produce over half of the country's milk and dairy products.\nWe are visiting one farm in Hokkaido that wants to transform the source of the pungent aroma in the air into something valuable. They are turning cattle manure into hydrogen.\u00a0\nWhen it is burned, hydrogen does not emit carbon, making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. There are widespread hopes it could be used as a sustainable fuel to heat homes and power cars, trains, aircraft and ships in the future.\nBut the most common way of producing hydrogen today involves using methane \u2013 a fossil fuel piped up from deep underground, meaning it is still associated with significant carbon emissions. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting water using electricity, but this can be expensive and is only low carbon if renewable sources of electricity are used.\nThe Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm, however, is using a different source \u2013 a waste product that there is no shortage of on Hokkaido. Around 20 million tonnes of cow manure is generated in Hokkaido annually. If not treated correctly, it can be an environmental burden, producing significant methane emissions as well as affecting water quality if allowed to leak into streams and rivers. So can it instead be used as a source of sustainable energy?\n\"This project to produce hydrogen from livestock manure originated in Japan and is unique to this place,\" says Maiko Abe from Air Water, one of several companies involved in the hydrogen farm project. We are visiting the facility in Shikaoi, a town in central Hokkaido, to film an upcoming episode of the BBC's TechXplore focusing on Japan. \"Shikaoi accounts for 30% of Hokkaido\u2019s cow waste and urine, so it has great potential for renewable energy.\"\nLaunched in 2015 by Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, the project aims to convert agricultural by-products into hydrogen to supply the local, rural community in a circular economy.\u00a0The cow excrement and urine is collected from local dairy farms before being fed into a anaerobic digester at a central facility. Here bacteria break down the organic waste to produce biogas and a liquid fertiliser. The biogas is then purified into methane that is used to manufacture hydrogen.\nThe plant now has a hydrogen production capacity of 70 cubic metres (18,500 gallons), with an onsite fuelling station that can fill around 28 vehicles fitted with hydrogen fuel cells per day, says Abe. Although the fuel can be used by cars with fuel cells, the plant's fuelling station has been specially designed to accommodate agricultural vehicles such as tractors and forklift trucks. These farm vehicles are difficult to electrify with batteries due to their size and the type of work they do. The hydrogen-powered vehicles are used around the farms' sites, reducing the emissions that would otherwise be created by using other fuel sources.\u00a0\nCattle-made-hydrogen is also stored in canisters that are transported to provide power and heat to other facilities in the area, including a local sturgeon fish farm and the nearby Obihiro Zoo.\nBut hydrogen isn't without its problems. It needs to be stored in high-pressure tanks as a gas, and can be prone to leakage due to its low molecular weight. It can also degrade metal storage containers, leaving them embrittled, and is easily ignited and so requires additional safety precautions when handling it.\nHydrogen can also be stored as a liquid by chilling it to cryogenic temperatures of below \u2013253C (-423F), but this can be energy intensive and requires large amounts of additional infrastructure.\nHydrogen has nearly three times the energy content of petrol (gasoline) when taken by mass alone. But its low molecular weight also means that by volume, the energy packed into a litre of liquid hydrogen is a quarter that of petrol. Put simply, as the lightest gas in the Universe, hydrogen takes up more space kilogram for kilogram than petrol. This means a lot more storage space is needed for hydrogen compared to fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and natural gas. It also means producing and storing it at scale can require large amounts of energy and infrastructure.\nBut as well as these hurdles, the hydrogen farm project in Hokkaido also faces other challenges specific to northern Japan's climate.\nHokkaido's subzero winters means new technologies are needed to produce the hydrogen stably without the small amounts of water vapour in the methane freezing.\nUsing agricultural waste as a methane source to produce hydrogen is relatively uncommon, but it ultimately uses\u00a0the same process as is used to produce hydrogen from natural gas: steam reforming. Here, steam heated to 800C (1,472F) reacts with the methane to produce hydrogen, along with the byproducts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO2).\u00a0\nIn the case of cow manure, however, says Abe, the project remains sustainable as this carbon originated in the grass the cows grazed on: \"Since it was originally in the atmosphere, it is considered carbon neutral.\"\nIn addition, it helps to prevent the methane that would otherwise have been emitted from the manure from getting into the atmosphere, where it is a potent greenhouse gas.\nLeftover slurry from the manure after the biogas has been extracted is sprayed as fertiliser onto nearby fields, while formic acid \u2013 which is both used in and created by the processes \u2013 could be offered as a preservative for cattle feed, says Abe.\u00a0\nCurrently, the electricity needed to produce and store the hydrogen comes from the national grid. But Abe says there's potential to shift to green energy, given Hokkaido\u2019s promising sea, wind and geothermal potential, thus reducing the carbon emissions of this electricity.\nStill, other challenges remain. The high cost of the hydrogen compared to fossil fuels and low demand mean expanding the operation is difficult.\u00a0\n\"The construction costs of hydrogen stations are very high,\" says Abe. \"Since hydrogen vehicles are not yet widespread, we're keeping our filling capacity low to manage initial investment. As adoption increases, we'll expand supply.\"\nTo encourage hydrogen vehicle adoption in the area, hydrogen prices are subsidised by the plant, matching the cost of petrol. Hydrogen refuelling stations are also being developed in major Hokkaido cities like Sapporo and Muroran.\nHype Meter\nThe process to make clean hydrogen fuel from cow manure in Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm is worth paying attention to, especially as it also reduces methane which would otherwise be released from the manure. With other countries exploring how to use other types of waste, from pig dung to coconut husks, to produce hydrogen using similar processes, it appears this could be a model adaptable to other local contexts.\nWith the scale still small, however, and costs of production high, it remains to be seen how widespread this industry can be. There are also other ways of producing fuel from cow waste, such as simply using the biogas produced from manure as a fuel itself without needing to convert it to hydrogen.\u00a0\nJapan is the world leader in hydrogen vehicles and has invested considerably in developing the technology. But for now battery-powered electric vehicles remain cheaper than hydrogen powered ones.\nThough it's unlikely that cow manure alone will ever meet Japan's hydrogen demand, it could contribute significantly, and Shikaoi is creating a model for a circular economy that it hopes will show how costs can fall with the economies of scale.\u00a0\nAnd there is growing interest in other parts of the world in using waste materials to produce hydrogen, with pig dung, poultry waste and even coconut husks having been explored as potential feedstocks. In Thailand, vehicle manufacturer Toyota is even exploring the use of hydrogen made from chicken waste to fuel its vehicles.\nMeanwhile, engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago in the US recently developed another promising method to make hydrogen involving manure. In their case, they used the manure, along with sugarcane waste and corn husks, to make biochar, a carbon-rich substance which vastly reduces the amount of electricity needed to convert water to hydrogen.\n\"We are the first group to show that you can produce hydrogen utilising biomass at a fraction of a volt,\" says Meenesh Singh, a chemical engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago who led the project.\nIn the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, on Kyushu, meanwhile, another waste product is being used to produce hydrogen \u2013 and here the dung is from humans.\nFor more than a decade, hydrogen has been created at the city's sewage treatment plant for use in hydrogen-powered vehicles. Most recently it has been used to fuel a fleet of zero-emission rubbish trucks.\nAkira Miyaoka, hydrogen utilisation manager for Fukuoka City, says trucks that transport daily products are the town's main source of CO2, rather than large factories as in many other cities. \"So we are working to reduce CO2 emissions from commercial trucks,\" she says.\nThe initiative started as a collaboration between Kyushu University and Fukuoka City, but now involves several major companies including Toyota.\n\"Sewage is something that is steadily discharged every day in the daily lives of citizens, so by making effective use of that sewage and extracting hydrogen as energy, we can achieve local production and local consumption of energy,\" says Miyaoka.\u00a0\nGenerating hydrogen from human waste starts with water from various household sources \u2013 including showers, dishwashers and toilets \u2013 arriving at the treatment plant. As the water is cleaned, the residual sludge is kept as a source of biogas and converted into hydrogen.\u00a0\n\"Sewage and biogas contain various impurities, so the process begins with the process of removing those impurities, which I think is a little different from other hydrogen production processes,\" says Miyaoka.\nIn 2024, Toyota helped the city launch Japan\u2019s first hydrogen-powered service vehicle fleet, including ambulances, delivery vans and bin trucks. Officials at the sewage treatment plant say it is capable of producing 300kg (661lbs) of hydrogen in 12 hours \u2013 enough to fuel 30 trucks.\u00a0\nThe rubbish trucks head out six nights each week, each collecting 1.7 tonnes (3,700lb) of rubbish, all while running silently and emission-free on the bodily waste of the people they are collecting other waste from.\nFukuoka's sewage-to-hydrogen fuelling station has been around since 2015, and several other countries around the world are now adopting a similar approach.\nConcord Blue has developed waste-to-energy plants in Germany, India, Japan and the US, converting waste and biomass into hydrogen and bioenergy. Several water authorities in the UK are also working on projects to derive hydrogen from sewage.\nA prototype race car has also been developed using sewage-derived hydrogen in the UK. The Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), in partnership with Severn Trent Water, is harnessing microbes that generate hydrogen fuel from waste. They anticipate the technology could hit the mainstream within five years, despite existing challenges. (Read about how sewage-powered cars could be the future of motorsport.)\nOn a larger scale, aviation accounts for 2% of global carbon emissions, and researchers in a UK lab have developed jet fuel made entirely from human sewage.\nStill, despite the promise, all of these technologies have yet to be delivered at significant scale.\nWhether in rural or city landscapes, the Japanese projects we've seen during in filming are inspiring because they have the local community at their heart.\nWhile adoption of hydrogen cars has stalled, hydrogen truck adoption is increasing gradually and it is these larger heavier industrial vehicles that contribute most significantly per vehicle to greenhouse gas emissions.\nBy reimagining waste as a resource, these projects demonstrate that energy can be found in even the most unlikely of places.\n* Paul Carter is the presenter of TechXplore.

        "article_text": "Viewers and critics have heaped praise on Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, with many hailing it as a landmark TV show.\nThe four-part British series was released last week and is the most-watched show on the platform around the world over the weekend.\nThe Times' Tom Peck described it as \"complete perfection\", a view echoed by the Guardian's Lucy Mangan, who said it was \"the closest thing to TV perfection in decades\".\nFans on social media ranged from US director Paul Feig, who called the first episode \"one of the best hours of television I've ever seen\", to Jeremy Clarkson, who called it \"masterful\".\nAdolescence shows the aftermath of the stabbing of a teenage girl, with a 13-year-old boy from her school arrested for her murder.\nJamie, the young suspect, is played by newcomer Owen Cooper, with Stephen Graham as his dad.\nIts story shines a light on the corrosive impact of social media and misogynist influencers on some teenage boys.\nGraham said he was inspired to make the show after seeing two separate reports of boys stabbing girls to death.\n\"I just thought, what's going on in society where this kind of thing is becoming a regular occurrence?\" he told BBC's The One Show.\n\"I just couldn't fathom it. So I wanted to really have a look and try and shine a light on this particular thing.\"\nWriter Jack Thorne said they wanted to \"look in the eye of male rage\".\nThe central character had been \"indoctrinated by voices\" like Andrew Tate's and \"voices a lot more dangerous than Andrew Tate's\", Thorne told Radio 4's Front Row.\nErin Doherty, who plays a child psychologist, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This show has the bravery to just peel back the layers and go, let's talk about this thing, because we're still dealing with it today. There are still issues cropping up in the news today.\n\"So all we can hold ourselves accountable for is having the discussion, and hopefully that's what it does.

        "article_text": "When Kajol contracted tuberculosis in January, USAID kept her alive. Now she and her family are in danger again after the Trump administration ordered most US aid spending to end.\nTB can be fatal if left untreated. The highly contagious bacterial disease, which usually infects the lungs, is not prevalent in rich countries, because treatment is relatively cheap. But in Bangladesh, it is a scourge.\nThat's especially so in neighbourhoods such as Mohammadpur, a slum in the capital Dhaka where Kajol,17, lives. \n\"We are poor people,\" she says. She is the sole breadwinner for herself, her mother and little brother. Her job in a garment factory keeps them all afloat.\nSo when she fell ill in January, it could have been catastrophic.\nInstead, help arrived through Dipa Halder. For the last three years, she has been canvassing the residents of Mohammadpur about TB and getting people the treatment they so desperately need, free of cost.\nThe initiative, which gets people tested and get them treatment they need including proper nutrition, is run by a local aid organisation, Nari Maitree. It was funded by the US Agency for International Aid (USAID) until February, when it received a letter from the US government saying the funds had been terminated.\nThat brought Kajol's treatment, only partially completed, to an abrupt end.\nCutting off medicines mid-treatment makes the chances of TB becoming drug-resistant much greater. It makes the disease much more difficult to combat and puts patients at greater risk of severe illness and death. \nThe government provides free medication but getting diagnosed and collecting the medicines can be cost prohibitive for many.\n\"Now I have to go get the medicine myself,\" she says. \"I am struggling a lot.\"\n\"The people here are quite vulnerable,\" says Dipa, 21. \"I can tell them to go to a particular doctor, which would help them save some money. \n\"Or I try to provide them with some financial assistance from our organisation so that they can continue their treatment.\"\nAccording to a US government performance report seen by the BBC, support by USAID in 2023 resulted directly in the identification and reporting of more than a quarter of a million new cases of TB in Bangladesh. In the same year, there were 296,487 new or relapse cases of TB which were cured or successfully completed as a result of USAID.\nThe agency was seen as integral to the country's fight against tuberculosis.\n\"You ask people on the street, they will say yeah, it's the US, they are the ones that are keeping it [tuberculosis] in control,\" said a director of a USAID project in Bangladesh, who is not authorised to speak publicly and did not want to be named.\n\"Bangladesh was USAID's largest programme in Asia,\" says Asif Saleh, executive director of the non-profit BRAC organisation. \"In terms of its impact, particularly in the healthcare sector, it has been massive.\n\"Particularly around vaccination, reducing child mortality and maternal mortality, USAID has played a massive role in this country.\"\nIn 2024, Bangladesh received $500m in foreign assistance. This year, that amount has cratered to $71m. To put that number into context, in the three-year period from 2021-2023, USAID committed an average of $83m annually in Bangladesh for health initiatives alone, including combating TB.\nCuts to USAID have meant Nari Maitree can no longer offer its Stop TB Program, but it also means Dipa is out of work. She supports her elderly parents and her younger sister.\n\"I am completely shattered now that I lost my job. I am carrying the burden of the family. Being unemployed is a devastating situation,\" she told the BBC.\nIn a document seen by the BBC, 113 programmes that were funded directly by the USAID office in Bangladesh have stopped. The list does not include the myriad programmes that are funded directly by US agencies in Washington.\n\"The NGO sector [In Bangladesh] employs 500,000 people at least,\" says Mr Saleh. \"It's huge. Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be eliminated.\"\nIt's not just the United States that is moving away from foreign aid. The UK has announced cuts to its foreign assistance programmes, as has Switzerland. It is likely that other countries may follow suit.\nIt's a sobering reality for Bangladesh. The country's government was overthrown last year and the economy is shaky, with inflation near 10% and a jobs crisis, particularly among young people.\nInterim leader Muhammad Yunus says Bangladesh will come up with a new strategy on how to survive following the aid cuts \u2013 but doesn't say how.\nWhen pressed in a BBC interview on how the country will cover the shortfall from USAID, Yunus said: \"It was a small part, not a big deal. It doesn't mean Bangladesh will disappear from the map.\"\nAsif Saleh says the way the cuts have been implemented has been abrupt and chaotic. The impact on a country like Bangladesh is immeasurable.\nNowhere is that more clear than in Cox's Bazar, a coastal city in south-eastern Bangladesh, home to the world's largest refugee camp. More than one million Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority community that the United Nations calls victims of ethnic cleansing, fled violent purges in their home country, neighbouring Myanmar.\nUnable to go back home and unable to work outside the refugee camp, the Rohingya depend on international aid for their survival.\nThe United States contributed almost half of all aid to Rohingya refugees.\n\"We have run out of soap,\" says Rana Flowers, country representative for the UN children's agency Unicef. \"We are now having to truck water into the camps. It's an absolutely critical time. There is an outbreak of cholera with over 580 cases, along with a scabies outbreak.\"\nWater sanitation projects in the camps used to be funded by USAID.\nSince the order to stop work went into effect at the end of January, hospitals such as the International Red Cross hospital in Cox's Bazar are reduced to providing emergency assistance only. Any hope the money would be reinstated was crushed this week, when the Trump administration cancelled more than 80% of all the programmes at USAID.\n\nPatients like Hamida Begum, who was getting regular treatment for hypertension, are left with few options.\n\"I'm old and I don't have anyone to help me,\" she says. Her husband died last year, leaving her to care for her four children alone, including her 12-year-old daughter who cannot walk.\n\"I cannot go to another hospital far from home because of my daughter.\"\nAt a nearby UN food distribution centre, Rehana Begum is standing beside two large sacks.\nInside, she says, are six litres of cooking oil and 13kg of rice, along with basics such as onions, garlic and dried chillies. These rations, given to her by the World Food Programme (WFP), need to last her and her family a month.\nI ask how she will manage now that her rations will be cut in half beginning next month.\nShe looked shocked. Then she started to cry.\n\"How can we possibly survive with such a small amount?\" asks Rehana, 47, who shares one room with her husband and five children. \"Even now, it is difficult to manage.\"\nThe WFP says it was forced to make the drastic cut because of \"a critical funding shortfall for its emergency response operations\".\nThe rations now being allotted to the Rohingya community will only meet their basic daily dietary needs, igniting fears they will be left with just enough to live and not much more.\n\"This is an absolute disaster in the making,\" says Rana Flowers of Unicef. \"Desperate frustrated people within the camps will lead to security concerns. If that escalates to the degree it could, we won't be able to go into the camps to help.\"",

        "article_text": "To celebrate World Sleep Day, here's our science-based guide to getting the best slumber you can \u2013 from varying sleep with the seasons to taking inspiration from the past.\nIt's a typical weekday morning, and you're just beginning to stir in bed. There's light streaking through the windows, while the many chirps and caws of birds announce that it's probably time to get up\u2026 but surely that can't be right? Cue the familiar feeling of dread, as you remember a night filled with restless, low-quality sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\nAcross the world, people are struggling with insufficient sleep. In the US alone, it's been estimated that between 50 and 70 million people suffer from the affliction, and on a global scale, it has even been called an epidemic. However, there are some simple adjustments \u2013 both psychological and physical \u2013 that might help to improve the quality of your sleep. Here's our guide to having a delicious, restful slumber, inspired by the latest scientific research and some long-forgotten historical tricks.\u00a0\u00a0\nToday, when people wake up in the middle of the night, it's not unusual to panic \u2013 after all, we tend to believe that we should sleep for a continuous eight hours. But this has not always been the case. For millennia, people had a short first sleep \u2013 and then they woke up. These little slumber-gaps were filled with an endless variety of activities, from household chores to gossip in the dark (and even the occasional murder). Then after a couple of hours, people went back to bed and slept through until the morning.\u00a0\nThis is the forgotten ancient practise of \"two sleeps\". It was rediscovered by Roger Ekirch, a university distinguished professor of history at Virginia Tech, Virginia, in the 1990s. He believes that an awareness of the habit's historical prevalence might help to reframe the experiences of those who suffer from insomnia today \u2013 and perhaps lessen their anxiety about waking up in the night. Read more about the lost ancient habit of \"biphasic sleep\" in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs spring arrives, you might notice that you need less sleep and are finding it easier to leave your bed in the morning. Research shows that we need more sleep during the dark, cold winter months than we do during the summer. This is because humans experience seasonal sleep. According to one German study, people experienced both longer REM and deep sleep in December than in June. REM sleep is the most active stage of sleep, when we dream and our heart rate increases, while deep sleep is when the body repairs muscle and tissues and is important for the consolidation of long-term memory.\u00a0Read more about the seasonality of human sleep in this article by Isabelle Gerretsen.\u00a0\nIn many countries having a catnap is a daily ritual, and research shows that regular naps are good for our health. According to a 2023 study, habitual napping helps keep our brains bigger for longer and can delay brain ageing by between three to six years. A smaller brain volume has been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.\nThere are also short-term benefits. Short naps, lasting no longer than 15 minutes, can immediately improve how well we perform mentally, with results lasting up to three hours after we wake up. The key to power naps is to keep them short (after 20 minutes we start drifting into deep sleep) and to make sure you have one mid-afternoon so that it doesn't disrupt your sleep at night. Read more about the health benefits of napping here.\u00a0\nBut not all naps are good for us. Some last mere seconds and these microsleeps can result in serious harm if they occur when you're driving. Analysis of dashcam footage from 52 drivers from a single truck company in Japan found that three quarters of them showed signs of microsleep before they were involved in a collision.\nMicrosleeps are more common among people who suffer from narcolepsy or people who don't get enough sleep at night. One study found that when people slept for just six hours a night for 14 days in a row, they had as many microsleeps as those who missed a whole night's sleep. If you're regularly experiencing microsleeps, it's therefore probably a sign that you're not getting enough sleep generally.\u00a0Read more about the naps that only last a few seconds in this article by Claudia Hammond.\u00a0\nAs we snuggle up in bed for the night \u2013 particularly if it's just with a good podcast \u2013 we might wonder why it's so cold under the covers, or even a bit lonely.\nHistorically, having your own bed was highly unusual. Like it or not, most people had to share \u2013 and not just with their siblings in childhood, or as a married couple. Until the 19th Century, the majority of people would have slept communally, routinely slumbering alongside friends, colleagues and even total strangers. A good bedfellow would provide warmth and conversation into the early hours of the morning \u2013 though you might have to overlook their morning breath and contribution to a bedful of biting parasites. Read more about the forgotten habit of communal sleep in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nHow much sleep we all need can vary from person to person, with most recommendations for between seven and nine hours. But the amount of sleep you get is only one part of the equation. Quality matters as much, if not more.\nMost of us will have experienced feeling less refreshed after a night of tossing and turning. That's partly because when we sleep, our brains flood with cerebrospinal fluid to clear out accumulated debris and toxins. This waste-clearance system is called the glymphatic system, which works best at the same time every day. This means that when we get our shuteye is important. Syncing sleep with our natural circadian rhythms \u2013 the brain's 24-hour internal clock that regulates the cycle of alertness and sleepiness \u2013 gives rise to the best-quality rest.\u00a0Read more about the importance of sleep quality in this feature by Sandy Ong.\u00a0\nToday most people in the Western world are lucky enough to wake up on a soft bed, perhaps with a spring mattress or memory foam. However, things have not always been so comfortable.\u00a0\nIn the medieval era, many people opened their eyes each morning to stuffy air and pitch-blackness \u2013 the conditions inside a \"box bed\". These popular sleeping-cupboards were completely enclosed, and helped to keep people warm at night, though they were sometimes not much bigger than a wardrobe. Slightly later there came the \"tick\" mattress, a bag of cheap materials such as straw or leaves. Unfortunately, they also provided the ideal hiding place for ticks, fleas and bedbugs. But the true inventors of a bad night's sleep might arguably have been the Victorians, who created a variety of unpleasant solutions for homeless people, from rows of coffin-beds to a rope to hang oneself over for a rest. Read more about the curious history of beds through the centuries, or top up your knowledge on why medieval people slept in cupboards, in these articles by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nSo, find yourself some bedfellows, allow for more sleep in the winter, and if you occasionally wake up in the night, consider yourself a modern pioneer of the lost ancient habit of biphasic sleep. We still can't promise that you'll be leaping out of bed on a Monday morning, but it's a start.\u00a0\n--\nThis story was originally published on 15/03/2024.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.",

A year removed from a historic series success in New Zealand and six months on from completing the Grand Slam on home soil, it felt as though the squad were peaking at the right time. \nIt proved a false dawn. Johnny Sexton, the heartbeat of Irish rugby, was denied a fairytale ending to his Test career. Eighteen months on, three of his long-time team-mates - Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray - bow out amid a feeling of what might have been. \nAnd the curtain closing on three more illustrious careers in green brings into focus the need for Ireland to evolve. \nEven before the France game, Paul O'Connell admitted the squad will encounter \"days when we struggle\" given the experience drain. \nAnd while striking a more positive note, Caelan Doris hammered home the need for improvement on the road ahead as he recapped his first Six Nations as captain on Saturday. \n\"There are obviously lots of things we can learn and grow from over the last couple of weeks and I hope that it will be a springboard for us as a group to go on and continue to evolve, and a bit of a realisation that there's still a lot of work to be done and a lot in us,\" said the Irish skipper. \nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders\nFor the first time in 14 years, O'Mahony will not be part of that work. \nHaving poured his lot into the Irish cause over a career that yielded 114 caps and five Six Nations titles - including one as captain - the Munster great is looking forward to watching games from the stands with his family. \nAnd as he bows out, O'Mahony - as well-placed as anyone to comment on the health of Irish rugby - insists the team is still in \"incredible shape\" despite a third-place finish, considering where they have come from. \nO'Mahony, of course, was one of the last links to the darker days, pointing to the famous 2013 loss to Italy in Rome. \nIreland finished fifth that year, but rebuilt impressively under Joe Schmidt after Declan Kidney's departure, capturing back-to-back titles in 2014 and 2015 before the Grand Slam three years later.\n\"Now the expectation of everyone in Ireland when we take to the pitch is that we win,\" said O'Mahony, who received a rapturous ovation when he replaced Josh van der Flier after 51 minutes against Italy.\n\"The expectation when we start the Six Nations is that we win the Six Nations. That's down to the hard work of the players. We've gone from hoping to expecting. Over the space of a decade or so, we've changed the mindset of players and supporters to expect nothing but wins from Ireland. \n\"That group is one of the most talented you'll ever come across from an Irish point of view. I look at the younger players I've been lucky enough to play alongside over the past eight weeks, it's getting better and better. \n\"It gives me a huge amount of pride, Cian [Healy] spoke inside about leaving a mark on the younger players and if I've made a little difference or shown them a few things not to do, I'd be a happy man.\"\nProp Jack Boyle was the only Ireland debutant during this year's Six Nations\nThe pain of relinquishing their Six Nations crown will be acute in the days ahead, but Ireland have much to look forward to in the remainder of 2025. \nHowever, before a Chicago rematch against the All Blacks and mouthwatering Dublin Tests against Australia and South Africa in November, interim boss Simon Easterby will oversee a summer tour. \nWhile the details have not been confirmed, matches against Georgia, Romania and Portugal have been mooted. \nRegardless of the opponents, though, it will be a crucial period as Easterby looks to future-proof the squad and introduce new talent to the international game while his frontline players are on the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. \nSince last year's Six Nations triumph, Ireland have blooded Jamie Osborne, Tom Clarkson, Sam Prendergast, Cormac Izuchukwu, Gus McCarthy and Jack Boyle. \nBut outside of the retiring O'Mahony and Conor Murray, 10 of Ireland's 23 against Italy are at least 30 years of age, highlighting the need for squad progression. \nSummer tours on Lions years have in the past been fertile ground for Ireland. The 2017 tour to Japan, for example, marked the emergence of Jacob Stockdale, Andrew Porter and James Ryan. \nWhether or not Ireland uncover a similar calibre of player this year remains to be seen, but there appears an acknowledgement of the need to deepen the squad before Andy Farrell's return from Lions duty. \nNow the work must start.",

        "article_text": "England head coach Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel has named his first squad since succeeding Gareth Southgate - and it is a selection that is already prompting wide debate.\nTuchel has recalled former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, who is 35 in June, while Marcus Rashford is rewarded with a return to the squad for his fine form on loan at Aston Villa from Manchester United.\nHe has also revealed first picks at either end of the age scale from Arsenal's 18-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly to 32-year-old Newcastle United defender Dan Burn for the World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia at Wembley next Friday (21 March) and Monday (24 March) respectively.\nSo what can be unpicked from Tuchel's first indication of England's future direction?\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nReaction, analysis & your views on Tuchel\u2019s first England squad\nPick your England XI for World Cup qualifiers - and fans have their say\nTuchel's appointment as England head coach has always carried the feel of an 18-month job focussed entirely on winning the World Cup and not beyond.\nWin then move on. Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with what he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nThis video can not be played\n'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'\nWatch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squad\nHenderson embodies everything we try to build - Tuchel\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park.

Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.Tuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.England exiles in from the coldThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.Henderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.The former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.Tuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'When Rashford plays, he's one of the best'Watch The Football News Show on Tuchel's first England squadHenderson embodies everything we try to build - TuchelPublished12 hours agoTuchel's England will get physicalTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.Burn, at 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running.

        "article_text": "Sue Nelson explores how asteroids can inform our understanding of the Earth's past \u2013 or threaten our future.\nEach year, according to Nasa, a chunk of rock the size of a car hurtles through space on a collision course with our planet. Fortunately, thanks to the Earth's atmosphere acting as a natural shield, instead of crash landing on the ground, the asteroid burns up and produces an impressive light show, streaking across the sky as a meteor or fireball.\u00a0\nUnfortunately, other, much larger asteroids have the potential to be far more threatening than entertaining. \"Asteroids come in all sizes,\" says Michael K\u00fcppers, a planetary scientist for the European Space Agency (ESA). \"The really big ones, like the 10km (6.21 mile) [wide] or so asteroid that we think led to the extinction of the dinosaurs, happen maybe once every 100 million years.\"\nThe asteroid 2024 YR4, which was discovered in December 2024, has been making headlines around the world recently. At around 40-90m (131-295ft) wide, it is larger than a 12-storey building. In January this year, the ESA calculated the rock's trajectory and initially predicted that there was a 1.2% chance of impact with Earth on 22 December 2032.\nThis officially crossed the comfortable threshold of risk for a near-Earth object \u2013 1% \u2013 and triggered the need for investigation by several planetary defence organisations, as well as the US President and US Congress.\u00a0\nLuckily YR4 is not large enough to be capable of making our species extinct but it could still be a \"city killer\", according to some experts, if it is at the upper end of the estimated size range and landed in a heavily populated area.\u00a0\nIn February 2025, the risk of the asteroid hitting the Earth briefly climbed to 3.1% or one in 32. Luckily, humanity managed to avoid mass panic and the risk has since reduced to a more reassuring 0.001%. But where did this asteroid come from in the first place? And how concerned should we be about a similar scenario emerging in the future?\u00a0\nWhen it comes to understanding asteroids, astronomers and scientists are still being dealt the cards in order to understand the rules of this potentially risky celestial game.\n\"Scientifically there's a huge amount we can learn from asteroids,\" says Alan Fitzsimmons, an astronomer at Queens University Belfast and a member of one of Nasa's sky surveys that searches and tracks Near Earth Objects (NEOs). These are asteroids whose orbit brings them within 195 million km (121 million miles) of the Sun.\n\"Any asteroid we detect is generally a fragment of a much larger body that was formed at the birth of our Solar System\" says Fitzsimmons. \"So by studying their chemical make-up we get some idea of the conditions in the initial Solar System as since then, over 4.6 billion years, it has evolved dynamically.\"\u00a0\nThese ancient rocky remnants are sometimes referred to as minor planets. Often irregular and cratered, they can also be spherical. They can spin slow, fast or tumble. Usually solitary, they can sometimes be found in pairs (binary or double asteroids) and some even have their own moon. Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's website keeps tabs on their numbers and at the last count there are over 1.4 million in our Solar System. The majority are located within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter but millions more are too small to be detected.\u00a0\nMost of the time these asteroids remain restrained within that interplanetary belt by Jupiter's gravitational field, unable to coalesce into a larger body. But occasionally another asteroid or the influence of Jupiter's gravity can nudge some into another orbit around the Sun, towards the inner Solar System.\nOnce an asteroid has been ejected from its usual path and is potentially heading our way, the first challenge is to detect it.\u00a0\n\"All an asteroid looks like in a telescope is a point of light against other points of lights that are stars, except it's moving,\" says Kelly Fast, Nasa's acting planetary defence officer, \"and it's reflecting sunlight.\"\nThe brighter the asteroid, the bigger it will be. But its colour also affects the brightness as a small white asteroid might reflect more light than a much larger dark one. It's not an exact science, which is why YR4's size is estimated at 40-90m (131-295ft) wide. The more information we have, however, the more precise that number will become.\n\"A team at Nasa and an ESA team will be using the James Webb Space Telescope to take infrared observations of YR4,\" says Fast. These measurements of an asteroid's thermal emissions \"may be helpful for constraining that size range\", she adds.\nYR4, in common with most asteroids,\u00a0is from the asteroid belt. \"Which part of the belt is hard to tell,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"One clue that we have is a spectrum of its surface.\" By examining the intensity of light emitted over a range of wavelengths, specific materials on the surface of the asteroid can be identified. \"YR4 is a rocky asteroid that's deficient in lighter elements such as carbon, which tells us that it probably came from the inner asteroid belt,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"But exactly where we don't know \u2013 and we may never know.\"\nAsteroids are not all the same either. \"There are different populations,\" says Fast. \"Some are stony, some are carbonaceous and some have metallic content depending on the parent bodies they came from.\"\nWhile there are rare types of asteroids, more than three out of four are carbonaceous, or C-type, and contain carbon, appearing black as coal. The rest are mostly S-type or silicaceous \u2013 a mix of metal and silicate crystals \u2013 or metallic or M-type asteroids, which contain predominantly iron and nickel.\u00a0\nOne asteroid scientists are particularly interested in is\u00a0 \u2013 a large, metal-rich rock the shape of a potato, which inhabits the Solar System's main asteroid belt. It's thought this asteroid could be up to 95% nickel and iron, which is similar to the Earth's core. Studying it will therefore increase our understanding of how our own planet formed. Nasa's Psyche mission is currently on its way there and is due to arrive in August 2029.\nIn terms of metal content, asteroids like Psyche 16 are also potentially extremely valuable \u2013 it's thought to contain resources worth approximately US$10 quadrillion (\u00a37.8 quadrillion). In the future, if asteroid mining ever became necessary as well as economically and technically feasible, it's thought they could provide an abundance of resources.\nKnowing an asteroid's composition is key for defence reasons too. An iron-rich asteroid, for example would do more damage on impact than carbonaceous ones as it is more dense, has more mass and would have more energy if it smashed into a moon or planet. The Earth's Moon, as can be seen, is littered by asteroid impact craters since it only has a thin atmosphere, or exosphere, which cannot protective it. Although the Earth is unlikely to receive an impact by YR4, there remains a 1.7% chance it could hit our Moon.\nThe level of damage also depends on the asteroid's structure. \"If you know more about the structure of these objects,\" says Fitzsimmons, \"then you can calculate more accurately what happens when it hits the Earth's atmosphere.Most asteroids below 10km [6.2 miles] across are almost all either heavily fractured solid objects or rock piles \u2013 smaller fragments of asteroids grouped together mostly by gravity.\"\nDoes this mean a rubble pile asteroid would be more likely to burn up in the atmosphere and therefore be less dangerous? \"Unfortunately not,\" says Fitzsimmons. \"If an asteroid is hitting the Earth at 17km per second (over 38,000 mph), it's in the atmosphere for less than 10 seconds before it reaches impact.\"\nWhile the Earth's atmosphere acts as a protective barrier, that still doesn't prevent all damage. \"Something the size of YR4 would probably only make it to a few kilometres above the Earth's surface. It will lose its energy and explode at altitude. Although we wouldn't get a crater, we would have an air blast and that could be just as devastating as if it hit the ground,\" says Fitzsimmons.\u00a0\nAt the moment we don't know if YR4 is one solid object or whether it's a rock pile, but an air blast could have been significant considering what happened in 2013. A fireball \u2013 which is what an asteroid is called once it enters Earth's atmosphere \u2013 exploded about 14 miles (22.5km) above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia. Eyewitnesses described the light as brighter than the Sun, and the blast's shockwave damaged over 4,000 buildings and injured 1,200 people.\n\"The asteroid was around 20m (66ft) in size,\" says K\u00fcppers. \"This is maybe about the limit size where you would start worrying if it hits populated areas.\"\nCoincidentally, on the day of the Chelyabinsk event, a United Nations committee was underway in Vienna about defending Earth from future asteroid impacts. The meeting resulted in the International Asteroid Warning Network, chaired by Nasa, and a Space Missions Planning Advisory Group for space agencies around the world to collaborate.\nFortunately, there have already been a number of missions which have studied asteroids, starting with Galileo when it flew past two asteroids in the early 1990s. In 2000, Nasa's Near Shoemaker became the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid, Eros, and \u2013 a year later \u2013 to land on one too. The Japanese Huyabusa 2 mission visited the C-type asteroid 162173\u00a0Ryugu in 2018 and 2019 and even sent back a sample to Earth in a hermetically sealed container in 2005.\nThe US OSIRIS-REx mission (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security\u2013Regolith Explorer) collected dust and rocks from asteroid Bennu and returned them to Earth in 2023. Earlier this year, the first in-depth analysis of the samples' minerals and molecules were published. It included finding 14 of the 20 amino acids used by life to make proteins on Earth. The spacecraft, renamed OSIRIS-APEX, is now on its way to explore asteroid Apophis.\u00a0\nAll these missions, and more, have allowed scientists to study the composition and particle size of several asteroids, as well as the magnetic properties of samples to inform our understanding of the Solar System's early magnetic field. But there is another reason for studying asteroids, brought home by the concerns over YR4: to protect our planet.\nIn 2022, Nasa's Dart (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission deliberately aimed itself at a harmless \u2013 from the Earth's point of view \u2013 binary asteroid system consisting of asteroid Didymos (780m, or 2,559 ft) and its smaller orbiting asteroid or moonlet, Dimorphos (160m, or 525ft). The spacecraft used itself as a kinetic impactor, targeting Dimorphos at around 22,530km (14,000 miles) per hour. This was Nasa's first test to see if it could deflect an asteroid's path and it was a success. After impact, Dimorphos' orbit was altered. Does this mean, in future, that Nasa asteroid missions will focus on planetary defence rather than understanding more about the science?\u00a0\n\"We're very much interested in both,\" says Fast, \"and it's a really good partnership. The planetary defence coordination office at Nasa sits inside of the planetary science division because there is so much asteroid science involved in it. We want to protect the planet but we also want to study these amazing leftovers from the formation of the Solar System, both to understand the history of the Solar System and to see what the effects might be should they impact, or should we need to deflect one in space.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A fashion show held last week in a picturesque, snow-clad town in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked a major controversy that is still simmering.\nThe show, by the well-known fashion brand Shivan & Narresh, was held last Friday at a ski resort in Gulmarg to display their skiwear collection. The label is the first big, non-local brand to hold a fashion show in Kashmir, a scenic Himalayan region which has seen decades of violence.\nBut it soon sparked outrage among locals, politicians and religious leaders in Muslim-majority Kashmir after fashion publisher Elle India posted a video on social media which showed some models wearing underwear or bikinis. Locals were also angry over another video - shared by online magazine Lifestyle Asia - of a party held after the show, which showed people drinking alcohol outdoors.\nMany took offence with the show being held in the holy month of Ramadan - a time of fasting and prayer for Muslims - and accused the designers of \"mocking their faith\" and \"disregarding local culture and sentiments\". Some clerics called the show \"obscene\" and said it was like \"soft porn\". \nSome others explained that the outrage had arisen not only from religious conservatism, but also from a fear of cultural imposition from \"outsiders\". Kashmir has witnessed decades of armed separatist insurgency against Indian rule since the late 1980s. \nThe backlash prompted Elle India and Lifestyle Asia to delete their videos. Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja, the designers behind the label, also apologised, saying that their \"sole intention was to celebrate creativity\" and that they didn't intend to offend religious sentiments.\nKashmir - known as the land of saints and Sufism (Islamic mysticism) - has a rich tradition of spirituality which influences many aspects of peoples' lives. The traditional attire is modest, with locals - both men and women - often wearing the pheran, a long, loose cloak.\nThe row also moved off social media and a discussion about the show and the after-party caused a ruckus in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly.\nThe opposition criticised the government, accusing it of giving permission for the event despite being aware of local sensitivities. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah distanced his government from the event, saying it had been organised by private entities, and asking local authorities to investigate the matter and submit a report.\n\"If law has been violated, strict action will be taken,\" he said in the assembly on Monday. The police have not yet given details about who organised the event and what laws, if any, have been violated.\nThe fashion brand did not respond to the BBC's questions about the show, including about permissions it obtained.\nIt's not surprising that scenic Gulmarg - one of India's few skiing destinations and a favourite with tourists - was the choice of venue for a show highlighting a skiwear collection.\nFashion journalist Shefalee Vasudev says it's not uncommon for designers to want to hold fashion shows in exquisite locations.\nIn fact, international designers like Alexander McQueen and Karl Lagerfeld are remembered as much for their creative, theatrical fashion shows as they are for their iconic designs.\nBut experimentation brings with it the risk of controversy and so, it's important to be mindful of the political and cultural sensitivities of a place, Ms Vasudev told the BBC.\nAnd this holds especially true in a place like Kashmir, which has witnessed wars and decades of armed conflict.\nBoth India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the territory.\nThousands of people have been killed since the late 1980s, when a separatist insurgency broke out against Indian rule. Though the separatist movement has lost steam over the years, many locals continue to view the administration in Delhi with distrust.\nThese sentiments have deepened since 2019 when the federal government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, stripped the region of its autonomy.\nSo some locals told the BBC that they were not surprised by the reactions to the show.\n\"Everything in Kashmir is political; people see things through a political prism,\" says Mir, a professor at a local university (he asked for his surname to be withheld to protect his identity). He adds that people are sceptical about big corporate events like the fashion show and - even if they are organised by private players - they believe that the government is trying to dilute their culture.\nArshid Ahmad, a researcher, uses stronger words to express public angst. \"The government is trying to dilute the spirit of resistance in Kashmiris,\" he says.\nThis isn't the first time an event held by non-locals has triggered a controversy in Kashmir. In 2013, separatists and human rights activists in the region protested against a show by renowned conductor Zubin Mehta. They said it was an attempt by the government to show the world that all was well in Kashmir when people were \"suffering and dying\".\nSome of the recent apprehensions around culture and identity can also be tied to the increase in tourists to Kashmir from other states in India. The federal government has often connected this boom in tourism to the abrogation of Article 370, which stripped the region of its autonomy.\nNousheen Fatima, 34, says because of government messaging, people outside Kashmir now see the region as being safer and \"more assimilated with India\". But she alleges that many tourists do not respect the region's culture.\nLast year, a video showing tourists drinking alcohol during a boat ride on the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar evoked outrage from political and religious leaders, who called the behaviour \"un-Islamic and unethical\".\nIn February, locals put up posters in Srinagar, asking tourists to \"respect local culture and traditions\" and \"avoid alcohol and use of drugs\", but these were later pulled down by the police.\nIn an editorial for The Voice of Fashion magazine, Ms Vasudev argues that the outrage needs to be examined from a critical lens. She asks if it would have been all right for the show to have been held in another Indian city instead of Kashmir, where Muslims would also be observing Ramadan. And whether it would have been acceptable to hold the show in Kashmir if it featured only outfits perceived as modest.\nShe also points out that Kashmir is home to the \"world's finest wool yarn; some of the finest handspun, handwoven pashmina creations and its artisans\".\n\"What Kashmir creates and stands for cannot be replicated anywhere. Shouldn't a fashion show at Gulmarg then, with innovative garments made with 100% wool, be seen as regenerating interest in untried ways?\" she asks.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "As millions of people break their Ramadan fast, many believers around the world reach for a wildly popular dish tied to an unbelievable legend.\nOn a hot and sultry August evening in 2011, I sat at a table in my favourite restaurant in Kuwait City, facing the calm waters of the Persian Gulf, waiting for my iftar platter to arrive. The elaborate meal \u2013 consisting of fresh juices, stuffed dates, vegetable samosas, lamb pilaf, shish tawook (a marinated chicken kebab), local bread, coffee and desserts \u2013 was delicious.\u00a0\nYet, what still lingers on my tongue and in my mind more than a decade later isn't the delightful crunch of the samosa or the sapid juiciness of the shish tawook but the sweet taste of Om Ali, a simple-but-flavourful Egyptian dessert with a surprisingly dark history.\nFlash forward to 2025 and I'm standing in a small confectionery store in downtown Cairo, sharing another bowl of Om Ali, this time with my 12-year-old son, and I still can't stop drooling over the dish, despite having tried it in every Middle Eastern city I've visited during the last 14 years.\n\"A good bowl of Om Ali is unforgettable,\" says Nermine Mansour, a former Egyptian diplomat-turned-food writer and founder of the food blog, Chez Nermine. \"It is the perfect balance of flavours, textures and nutrition \u2013 the star of Egyptian cuisine,\" she adds.\u00a0\nOm Ali (also known as Umm Ali or Oum Ali) is a decadent bread pudding made from spice-infused milk, puff pastry, roasted nuts and sugar. Traditionally baked in a deep clay dish for about 20-25 minutes, it has a crunchy, caramelised coating at the top and a silky, creamy layer at the bottom, giving the dessert a unique texture. According to Mansour, the creaminess of the milk, the juiciness of the soaked puff pastry, the crunch from the nuts and the sweet earthiness of lent by the clay pot come together to give Om Ali a rare appeal, making it one of the most popular desserts in Egypt.\nWhere to find Om Ali\nAlthough Om Ali is available at all major cafes and bakeries in Egypt throughout the year, the variety and volume are staggering during Ramadan. Some of the best places to sample authentic Om Ali in Cairo are El Malky, Simonds Bakery & Caf\u00e9 and Nola Bakery.\nOm Ali is also a favourite across the Middle East, particularly during Ramadan and Eid celebrations when dessert consumption skyrockets. Earlier this year, B Laban, one of the fastest-growing Middle Eastern dessert companies, posted a video of Om Ali on Instagram and thousands of people quickly swooned over it.\n\"I get why Om Ali is so popular. It is affordable, easy to digest and can be prepared quickly using ingredients available at home, making it equally accessible to the rich and the poor,\" says Moustafa Omran, an Egyptologist and my local tour guide in Cairo. \"Despite the fame of this dish, a question always lingers in the minds of [Om Ali] lovers: who is Ali and who is his mother, after whom this dish is named?\" Omran points out, drawing my attention to the dessert's name.\nWith my mouth stuffed with soaked puff pastry and my mind going nuts over the creaming pudding at El Malky, one of the most famous dessert chains serving Om Ali in Cairo, I cannot help but agree.\nOm Ali, which means\u00a0\"Mother of Ali\" in Arabic, is an admittedly unusual\u00a0name for a dessert. Yet, what's even more unusual, as many Egyptians tell me, is that it is rumoured to be named after a murderer.\u00a0\nOm Ali was the first wife of\u00a0the first sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, which ruled Egypt from the mid-13th to early 16th Centuries. In 1250, her then-husband, Izz Al-Din Aybak overthrew the Ayyubid dynasty and established the Mamluk reign in Egypt, marrying Al-Durr, the last Ayyubid queen, to solidify his rule. The marriage was merely a political union and Al-Durr\u00a0had frequent disagreements with Aybak before finally deciding to murder him as he took a bath.\u00a0\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Om Ali decided to avenge her husband's death by beating\u00a0Al-Durr to death with wooden clogs. After killing\u00a0Al-Durr,\u00a0Om Ali instructed her cook to\u00a0bake something special to commemorate her success\u00a0and the eponymous dessert was allegedly born and named in her honour.\nAs surprised as I am to learn that Om Ali's origins may be rooted in murder and betrayal, deeper research reveals that the dish's origins are even more complex, and still baffle historians.\u00a0\n\"There are no historical records that tell us if the dessert Om Ali is connected to the murder of Al-Durr,\" says Dr Mennat-Allah El Dorry, a food historian at the American University in Cairo. \"Although we know for sure that Queen Om Ali killed Al-Durr, we do not have any concrete evidence linking the dessert to the murder\u2026 I have absolutely no idea how the narrative came about and how the dessert got its name.\"\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table\u00a0\"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nFurther, the oldest recorded recipe for Om Ali comes from a more recent 19th-Century Arabic cookbook titled Kit\u0101b nas\u1ecb\u0304h\u1ea1t al-an\u0101m f\u012b h\u1ee5sn al-t\u1ea1\u02bb\u0101m, which adds another layer of mystery to the dish's origins and nomenclature.\nYet, according to Mansour, the 13th-Century Om Ali narrative may hold some truth. \"Egyptians have eaten a thin phyllo bread called roqaq since ancient times,\" she says. According to the book The Pharaoh's Kitchen by Magda Mehdawy and Amr Hussein, roqaq has been a staple at Nubian banquets since the 3rd Century BCE. \"So, it is quite possible that Om Ali's cook used the leftover roqaq in the palace and baked it with milk and nuts to create the iconic dessert that we all love today.\"\nDespite the dessert's muddled origins, its connection to the killer of Al-Durr live on in Egyptian popular culture. Today, the name Om Ali is synonymous with good triumphing over evil \u2013 in this case, the unjust queen.\n\"We love it because of its association with the story of the victory of justice over injustice,\" says Omran. \"Also, we [Egyptians] love stories; therefore, this dish has gained immense popularity,\" he explains. The legend continues to endure in social media, food blogs and television, such as the 2004 popular drama series Abbas Al Abiad Fi Al Yawm Al Aswad, in which famous Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany recounts the legend of Om Ali to his onscreen family.\u00a0\nThe popularity of Om Ali swells during Ramadan, as sugar-based desserts take centre stage in iftar meals around the globe, providing instant nourishment to a fasting body that has run out of glucose. \"In addition to sugar, Om Ali contains protein and calcium from milk, vitamins and fibre from nuts, and carbohydrates from bread,\" Mansour points out. \"That's why, [Om Ali] is a guilty pleasure you can easily justify. It feels like a warm hug in a clay pot filled with goodness,\" she adds. (A calorie analysis reveals that Om Ali has fewer calories compared to other Middle Eastern desserts like kunefe and baklava.)\nBesides, Om Ali is an easy dessert to make. \"It requires only simple ingredients found in every Egyptian kitchen,\" Mansour adds. Depending on the size of the iftar parties, this dish can be scaled up or down, making it a favourite among chefs and home cooks during Ramadan and Eid.\nOm Ali holds a special place in Egyptian cuisine because it is simple, nutritious and evokes feelings of warmth and goodness. \"The creaminess of the pudding, the crunch of roasted nuts and the story of the victory of good over bad \u2013 a bowl of Om Ali just feels right and makes me happy after a long day of fasting,\" says Omran.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The record for a single trip into space currently stands at 437 days, but prolonged periods in orbit can alter an astronaut's body in some surprising ways, changing their muscles, brains and even their gut bacteria.\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore never intended to stay for nine months. Their initial trip to the International Space Station onboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was scheduled to be just eight days in June 2024. But after technical problems with the spacecraft meant it had to return to Earth without them, their stay in space has been longer than expected.\u00a0\nOf course, neither are new to the rigours of space travel. They are both experienced astronauts. But any extended time in the strange, low gravity environment of space is likely to have affected their bodies. To understand how, we need to look at those who have stayed for longer.\u00a0\nThe longest single spaceflight by an American to date was by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio after he spent 371 days\u00a0living aboard the\u00a0American-football-field-sized collection of modules and solar panels that make up the ISS.\nHis time in orbit \u2013 which surpassed the previous US record of 355 consecutive days \u2013 was extended in March 2023 after the spacecraft he and his crewmates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak. He eventually came home in October 2023. The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km).\nEven so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human \u2013 Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s.\nAnd in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts \u2013 Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub \u2013 broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. The pair departed the ISS in the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft along with US astronaut Tracy Dyson, who had spent six months onboard. With a huge grin on his face, Kononenko gave a double thumbs up as he was helped from the re-entry capsule after it bumped back to Earth in a cloud of dust near the remote town of Dzhezkazgan on the Kazakhstan Steppe. He now also holds the record for the longest cumulative time in space \u2013 a total of 1,111 days in orbit.\nKononenko and Chub travelled more than 158 million miles during their 5,984 orbits of the Earth in the latest mission to the ISS. But spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies, so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams.\nRubio's own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long-duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present. He is the first astronaut to participate in\u00a0a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body.\nWhile the results have yet to be published, it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to explore deeper into the Solar System. A return journey to Mars, for example, is\u00a0expected to take around 1,100 days\u00a0(just over three years) under current plans. The spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS, meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed.\nBut problems keeping fit aside, just what does spaceflight do to the human body?\nMuscles and bones\nWithout the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those\u00a0muscles that help to maintain our posture\u00a0in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps \u2013 in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks\u00a0muscle mass can fall by as much as 20%\u00a0and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%.\nSimilarly, because astronauts are not putting their skeletons through as much mechanical strain as they do when subject to Earth's gravity, their bones also start to demineralise and lose strength. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of their bone mass every month they spend in space and up to 10% over a six-month period (on Earth, older men and women lose bone mass at a rate of 0.5%-1% every year). This can increase their risk of suffering fractures and increase the amount of time it takes to heal. It can take up to four years for their bone mass to return to normal after returning to Earth.\nTo combat this, astronauts undertake 2.5 hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS. This includes a series of squats, deadlifts, rows and bench presses using a resistive exercise device installed in the ISS's \"gym\", alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike. They also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible.\nA recent study, however, highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size. It recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss.\nThe lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly. This can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on Earth. During a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to Earth, Rubio himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening.\n\"I think my spine has extended just enough that I'm kind of wedged into my seat liner, so I shouldn't move much at all,\" he said.\nWeight loss\nAlthough weight means very little while in orbit \u2013 the microgravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely, including human bodies \u2013 maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit. Although Nasa tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods, including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station, it can still affect an astronaut's body. Scott Kelly, a Nasa astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long-term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for 340 days while his twin brother stayed back on Earth, lost 7% of his body mass while in orbit.\nEyesight\nOn Earth, gravity helps to force the blood in our bodies downward while the heart pumps it up again. In space, however, this process becomes messed up (although the body does adapt somewhat), and blood can accumulate in the head more than it normally would. Some of this fluid can pool at the back of the eye and around the optic nerve, leading to oedema. This can lead to changes in vision such as decreased sharpness and structural changes in the eye itself. These changes can start to occur after just two weeks in space but as that time goes on, the risk increases. Some of the vision changes reverse within about a year of astronauts returning to Earth, but others can be permanent.\nExposure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems. The Earth's atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS, this protection disappears. While spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation, astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves.\nNeural shuffling\nAfter his long stay on the ISS, however, Kelly's cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother's on the ground. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home.\nA study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit. It found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function \u2013 in other words, movement \u2013 and also in the vestibular cortex, which plays an important role in orientation, balance and perception of our own motion. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down.\nA more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. Cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles (responsible for storing cerebrospinal fluid, providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste) can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size.\nFriendly bacteria\nIt is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorgansims that live in and on our bodies. This microbiota can influence how we digest food, affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work.\nResearchers examining Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the very different food he was eating and the change in the people he spent his days with (we obtain a horrifying amount of gut and oral microorganisms from the people we live alongside). But exposure to radiation and the use of recycled water, along with changes to his physical activity could all also have played a role. (Find out more about how exercise affects your gut microbes.)\nSkin\nAlthough there have now been five Nasa astronauts who have spent more than 300 days in orbit, we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit. His skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station. Researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint.\nGenes\n\nOne of the most significant findings from Kelly's prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA. At the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as telomeres, which are thought to help protect our genes from damage. As we age, these get shorter, but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these telomeres.\n\"Most striking, however, was the finding of significantly longer telomeres during spaceflight,\" says Susan Bailey, a professor of environmental and radiological health at Colorado State University who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother. She has done separate studies with another 10 unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months. \"Also unexpected was that telomere length shortened rapidly on return to Earth for all crewmembers. Of particular relevance to long-term health and ageing trajectories, astronauts in general had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they did before.\"\nExactly why this happens is still being unravelled, she says. \"We have some clues, but additional long-duration crewmembers \u2013 like Rubio, who spent one year in space \u2013 will be critical to really characterising and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes.\"\nOne possible cause could be exposure to the complex mix of radiation while in space. Astronauts who experience long-term exposure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage, she says.\nThere were also some changes in gene expression \u2013 the mechanism that reads the DNA to produce proteins in cells \u2013 seen in Kelly that may have been related to his journey into space. Some of these related to the body's response to DNA damage, bone formation and the immune system's response to stress. Most of these changes, however, had returned to normal within six months of his return to Earth.\nIn June 2024, a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight. Using gene expression data from samples obtained from the crew of the SpaceX Inspiration 4 mission, who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of 2021, it identified changes in 18 proteins related to the immune system, ageing and muscle growth.\nComparing their gene activity to those of 64 other astronauts on previous missions, the study found in the expression of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight. The men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight, with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to Earth.\nIn particular, the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin-6, which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body, and interleukin-8, which is produced to gulde immune cells to sites of infection, were more affected in the men compared to the women. Another protein, called firbrinogen, which is involved in blood clotting, was also affected more in male astronauts.\nBut the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight, but it could be related to their response to stress.\nYou can hear Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below. With an accumulated 675 days in space, she has spent more time in orbit than any other American, although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has clocked up 878 days in space.\nImmune system\n\nKelly received a series of vaccines before, during and after his trip into space and his immune system\u00a0was found to react normally. But Bailey's research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit.\nThere are still many questions to be answered, however, about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal, big-brained species that evolved to live on Earth. As researchers pour over Rubio's medical tests, blood samples and scans following his 371 days in space, they will doubtless be hoping they will learn more.\n* This article was originally published on 27 September 2023.

The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km).Even so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human \u2013 Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s.And in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts \u2013 Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub \u2013 broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down.Nasa/Getty ImagesScott Kelly's 340 day trip to the ISS allowed researchers to study how space affected him compared to his twin brother back on Earth (Credit: Nasa/Getty Images)A more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home.A study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit.

        "article_text": "In 2019, climate scientist Steffen Olsen took a startling photo of huskies appearing to walk on water. The photo quickly went viral as it revealed the reality of Greenland's rapidly melting ice.\nIn June 2019, a striking image of husky dogs apparently walking on water in Greenland stunned the world and quickly went viral.\nThe photo was taken by Steffen Olsen, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute and lead of Blue Action, a European project which investigates the effect of a changing Arctic on weather and climate.\n\"The reaction surprised me,\" says Olsen. \"It surprised me that so many people saw this as a beautiful photo. I saw it as a scary situation.\"\nThat's because the dogs were in fact wading through ankle-deep meltwater on top of sea ice in Inglefield Bredning, an 80km-long (49.7 miles) system in northwestern Greenland.\n\"I learned to see the photo as an illusion. People don't see sea ice, but dogs walking on water,\" Olsen says.\u00a0\nOlsen captured the photo while travelling with a team of scientists who were monitoring sea and ice conditions near the town of Qaanaaq, one of the world's most northerly towns. They were retrieving scientific instruments they had deployed during the winter.\u00a0\n\"We had been travelling for some hours and it became clear that the melting was very extreme\u2026 [the ice] more or less melted beneath our feet while we were travelling on it,\" says Olsen. \"The local hunters and I were very surprised\u2026 we were searching for dry spots to get the dogs and the sleds out of the water and there were none in sight. We turned around and made it back to the coast.\"\nThe dogs are typically very hesitant to get their paws wet, says Olsen. \"Usually when we meet water, it's because there are cracks in the sea ice and the dogs have to jump over the water\u2026they hate it. But it was actually very warm so I think they were happy to have cold feet,\" he says, adding that temperatures reached 14C (57F) on the day.\nThe scientists managed to retrieve their instruments a few days later once the water had drained away through small cracks in the ice sheet. \"Then you have a short period of time when you can then travel again before the ice collapses and breaks up,\" says Olsen.\nOlsen says he was extremely surprised by the rapid melting he witnessed when he took the photo on 13 June 2019. He has only experienced such an extreme event once during his 15 years carrying out research in Greenland. It's unusual for melting to occur that quickly, Olsen explains.\n\"It requires a sudden onset of warm air while you still have fresh snow on the ice and solid sea ice. So it's an example of an extreme event developing early in the season... The local community have told me: 'you will have to wait 100 years to see [such an event] again'.\"\u00a0\nMelting events such as the one Olsen witnessed would normally not occur until later in the season, in late June and July, but in 2019 melting started in mid-April, around six to eight weeks before the 1981-2020 average, and affected roughly 95% of Greenland's ice sheet, according to the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nSuch early melting events can have a \"snowball effect\" and lead to more melting as there is less snow and ice to reflect the Sun's rays back into space and keep the surface cool, explains Bianca Perren, a paleoclimatologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who studies sediment cores from polar regions to understand the long-term variability of the climate.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Antarctica's upside-down ice-scape we had no idea existed\n\u2022\u00a0The 'mind bomb' photos that changed the whaling industry\n\u2022\u00a0Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change\nGreenland experienced record ice loss in 2019, shedding a total of 532 billion tonnes from its giant ice sheet, according to a 2020 study. On average, Greenland loses 234 billion tonnes of ice per year\u00a0\u2013 enough to pack into 6,324 Empire State Buildings.\n\"2019 was a really unusually warm year, but so was 2012,\" says Kelly Hogan, a marine geophysicist at BAS who studies the impacts of Greenland's melting ice sheet. In 2012, the summer period (June-August) was more than 2C (4F) warmer than the average for 1981-2010, and more than 1.5C (3F) warmer for the entire ice sheet. \"Those extremes are coming round more frequently than we had thought they would. They're happening every few years,\" says Hogan.\n\"What's really distinctive about Greenland is how much melting you get on the surface in the summer, because you don't get anywhere near as much as that in Antarctica,\" says Hogan. \"When you see huge volumes of water [on the ice], it is really shocking.\"\nBut it's rare to see \"giant pools of water\" on the surface like in Olsen's photo, says Perren, as usually the water seeps through cracks in the ice. \"It basically pops the ice sheet up and floats it out to the coast. So often you don't have this pooling of water, but instead you have warm water that's being sent down into the bowels of the Greenland ice sheet, basically warming the whole thing,\" she says.\nThe rapid melting of the ice is already affecting local communities' way of life. \"They are having to adapt the way they hunt and fish,\" says Olsen.\nIf the ice is unsafe to travel on, it also makes it more difficult for scientists to carry out their research, Olsen adds. \"We will have to adapt and rely more on automatic instruments instead of community-based monitoring.\"\u00a0\nSafety is already a concern, says Perren, adding: \"I have promised my son that I will not step foot on the ice sheet because it's so dangerous.\"\nThe photo has helped raise awareness of Greenland's vulnerability to climate change, says Olsen. \"I have definitely found that you can get a lot of attention for the problem with a photo\u2026 so it has been very efficient.\n\"But I've also been challenged by people saying: 'how can you take a photo of climate change?' And I agree, you cannot take one photo and call it climate change, because that is something that unfolds over a longer time period,\" says Olsen. \"We need to explain the photo and provide the right context.\"\nPhotos are useful tools for starting conversation about the environment and explaining scientific phenomena, says Perren. \"Science has a communication problem,\" she says.\n\"When I first saw it in 2019 I remember thinking: 'oh my gosh, this is such a shocking image,'\" adds Perren. \"It's a symbolic image of what climate change looks like in Greenland. But there's also a scientific side to it: maybe this is unprecedented but it also [paints] a very good, kind of emblematic picture of what the future would look like.\"\nHogan says that photo \"really drives home the extent of the problem\". \"It looks like the dogs are skating on something without a bottom\u2026 it feels like they could just sink at any moment, which is maybe some sort of metaphor for the ice sheet and the future.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Newcastle, Aston Villa and Fulham are all in the race for Champions League football\nThe Premier League title race and relegation battles look ominously like 'done deals' - but what about the fight for Champions League football?\nEngland's top division is on course to gain an additional spot in Europe's elite club competition for next season thanks to Uefa's coefficient ranking table, which you can find out more about here.\nAs a result, as many as seven Premier League clubs could qualify but that would require Arsenal - though unlikely - or Aston Villa to finish outside the top five and win the Champions League, and either Tottenham or Manchester United to win the Europa League.\nOf the likely five spots on offer through the league, leaders Liverpool - 15 points clear at the top - will surely take one. Arsenal, in second, have an eight-point cushion to Newcastle in sixth so should secure another.\nHowever, with 10th-placed Fulham just five points off fifth, as many as eight teams probably remain in the mix for the final three places.\nCrystal Palace, in 11th, are in great form but closing a nine-point feels too big an ask, especially given the number of sides they would have to overhaul.\nWith 10 games left for most, BBC Sport looks at the eight clubs in contention and the challenges they will have to overcome to claim one of those lucrative places. Plus Phil McNulty gives his predictions on where each club will finish and fans have their say on why they back their team in the race for Europe...\nThis video can not be played\nNottingham Forest manager Nuno reflects on big win against Manchester City\nNuno Espirito Santo's side have been this season's surprise package (and a big one at that), going from a relegation scrap last term to challenging at the top, claiming famous wins at Anfield and Old Trafford along the way. Dreams of the title have faded since the start of the year but they remain in a great position to end a memorable campaign celebrating Champions League qualification.\nKey fixtures: The week after March's international break looks huge for Forest. After an FA Cup quarter-final at Brighton, they host Manchester United on 1 April before travelling to fellow top-five hopefuls Aston Villa four days later.\nShould it go down to the wire, expect quite the atmosphere when Forest face Chelsea at the City Ground on the final day of the season in what could be a winner-takes-all match.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Fourth\nWhat a story it will be for this great old club with the rich history of two European Cup wins under Brian Clough to return to the elite competition.\nAnd the surge of belief that swept around the atmospheric City Ground after the win against Manchester City makes you believe the force is with Nuno's side.\nThey have a top-class goalkeeper in Matz Sels, formidable central defenders in Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic, quality in midfield and out wide with Morgan Gibbs-White and Callum Hudson-Odoi. Throw in a striker having the season of his life in Chris Wood and a top-four place is there for the taking.\nOpta's prediction: 73.1% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nMossy: Best defence in the Premier League.\nStuart: Great business, great recruitment, great morals and an incredible work-rate.\nSteve: Forest will continue to do what they've done for most of the games so far, defend well and catch teams on the break.\nCole Palmer is Chelsea's top goalscorer in the Premier League but has gone seven league games without a goal\nAs recently as December, Chelsea were being mentioned as title challengers. Manager Enzo Maresca was quick to dismiss such talk before a post-Christmas slump that led to them dropping out of the Champions League spots. Back-to-back league wins suggest they might be finding form again at just the right time, though.\nKey fixtures: If Chelsea are to make the top five, they will really have earned it given their remaining fixtures. They travel to Arsenal on Sunday, then host rivals Tottenham before tricky games at Brentford and Fulham in April.\nIn May they face Liverpool and Manchester United at Stamford Bridge, either side of a trip to Newcastle, before that potentially crucial trip to Nottingham Forest on the last day.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Fifth\nTouted as title contenders at one point, there has been a drop off in form but Maresca still has lots of quality at his disposal. Cole Palmer is the shining symbol of that.\nMaresca's studied passing style of football has yet to fully win over Stamford Bridge and the fixture list is tough, but they should have enough to claim the fifth place which may secure Champions League football next season.\nOpta's prediction: 54.5% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nJohn: We'll qualify for Champions League because key players - including Nico Jackson - will come back from injury, Cole Palmer will find his form, and Enzo Maresca will loosen his system a bit and let these guys play the way they want to play.\nFahey: Our remaining 10 fixtures should result in 19-21 points, making 68-70 points overall. I think 65 will be enough to get fifth place.\nMatthew: Chelsea will qualify for the Champions League not on merit but because everyone else's form is also sketchy and others' inability to get results over the line will get us top five by default.\nThis video can not be played\n'He knows he should have saved that' - Hart on Ederson\nIn Pep Guardiola's time as manager, Champions League qualification has been a formality for City. However, injury problems and a once-formidable squad starting to show signs of age means it is just a matter of time before the defending champions relinquish their crown - and they still have work to do to book their place at Europe's top table next season.\nKey fixtures: In-form Brighton travel to the Etihad on Saturday with the chance to leapfrog City with a win, while Guardiola's side face Manchester United at Old Trafford early in April.\nBournemouth at home and Fulham away end City's league season and that could be very interesting should either side remain in the top-five hunt.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Third\nCity finishing in third place in the Premier League was unthinkable at the start of the season after four straight titles but they would gratefully settle for it now after a mediocre campaign by their own standards.\nThey still have some ground to make up, but with the quality still in Guardiola's squad and the goals of Erling Haaland, they should get that top-three place and go into the Champions League next season.\nOpta's prediction: 81.3% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nScott: Manchester City will qualify for the Champions League via their league position after a run of eight wins from their final 10 games.\nMark: City will qualify because the teams around them are even more unreliable when it comes to winning games.\nOnly Mohamed Salah and Erling Haaland have scored more than Alexander Isak in the Premier League this season\nAfter a taste of the Champions League last season, a year without European football looked like the perfect opportunity for Newcastle to get themselves back there. Alexander Isak spearheaded a brilliant mid-season run to raise hopes they could kick on for a top-three finish, but three losses in their last five games, coupled with some untimely injuries, slowed their momentum.\nKey fixtures: An away game against Aston Villa is the standout of a busy April in which Newcastle play six times in the league - with four home matches. A very tricky May follows, in which they travel to Brighton and Arsenal with Chelsea coming to St James' Park in between.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Sixth\nThis has been a mixed season, but eyes are firmly on that first major domestic prize in 70 years with the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley on Sunday.\nEddie Howe has a talented squad when fully fit, with a world-class striker in Isak. Top four may be beyond them but European football should not, irrespective of whether they end that long wait for a big trophy - their first since the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.\nOpta's prediction: 50.7% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nJohn: It's not a difficult run-in and with six of the final 10 games at home, Eddie Howe has the expert ability to implement the right tactics to deliver success.\nConnor: Eddie Howe is the best thing at this club in over 20 years and knows exactly what he's doing.\nBen: Alexander Isak - nothing more to say.\nBrighton are on their longest winning run in the league since April 2017\nBrighton look to have hit form at just the right time in Fabian Hurzeler's first season in charge, winning their past four league matches. With an FA Cup quarter-final to look forward to as well, the Seagulls could be heading for a thrilling conclusion to the campaign.\nKey fixtures: After taking on Manchester City on Saturday, Brighton host Aston Villa in their first league match after the international break, then travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace. Home games against Newcastle and Liverpool follow in May before a trip to Tottenham on the final day.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Ninth\nMomentum is all in the latter stages of the season and Brighton have it, as Hurzeler has engineered a remarkable run of six straight wins since the 7-0 loss at Nottingham Forest.\nThey can exact revenge on Forest in the FA Cup quarter-final, and anything is possible in their current form. They could yet make a nonsense of this prediction if it carries on, and they will really fancy their chances in the FA Cup.\nOpta's prediction: 18.1% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nPeter: The team play as a cohesive unit, believing in their potential to win against any opposition and backed up by an exemplar management structure, other clubs would be proud of.\nIan: Brighton have the momentum and there are no immovable objects in our way.\nMax: They have belief in themselves and are not afraid of any club.\nThis video can not be played\nEmery praises 'fantastic' Aston Villa defence\nIt has been a strange year for Aston Villa with Unai Emery's side thrilling in Europe but frustrating in the league. Given their Champions League exertions, perhaps the inconsistent league form shouldn't be too much of surprise. But, with one fewer game left to play than their rivals, Villa need to find last season's consistency for the next two months if they want to be back among Europe's elite in 2025-26.\nKey fixtures: For all that two-legged quarter-final against Paris St-Germain will draw the eye, Villa have got some tricky league fixtures in April as well.\nBrighton at home and Forest away start the month, Newcastle at Villa Park and Manchester City away end it. With Fulham, Bournemouth, Tottenham and Manchester United to follow in May, it doesn't get a whole lot easier.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Seventh\nVilla's Premier League form has been up and down but Emery is the master of Europe and cup competitions and they are in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and FA Cup. They must be serious contenders in the latter with a last-eight game at Preston North End.\nWill this be a distraction from the league? Time will tell, but Europe can still be achieved through the league, although repeating last season's top-four finish may be out of reach.\nOpta's prediction: 6.9% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nPrit: Strength in depth and the master strategist that is Unai Emery.\nMichael: We have a better manager, better squad and a much better fanbase than the opposing teams!\nThis video can not be played\n'Desire and intent' - Rooney full of praise for Bournemouth's front three\nDespite a terrible run with injuries, Bournemouth have continued to impress under Andoni Iraola this season. They've beaten Arsenal, Manchester City and Nottingham Forest at home, thumped Newcastle at St James' Park and reached an FA Cup quarter-final. Adding Champions League qualification to the list should not be ruled out.\nKey fixtures: With games at Arsenal and Manchester City to come in May, as well as a home match against Aston Villa, Bournemouth are likely to need a big April if they're to break into the top five. Given their only match against another side in the top half is at home to Fulham, the chance is there for them.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Eighth\nBournemouth are another team who will have eyes on what looks like a wide-open last eight in the FA Cup, although they have to navigate their way past Manchester City in the quarter-final.\nIraola has produced a top-class team with an intensity that makes them an eye-catching, entertaining watch. Will the FA Cup focus their minds more than the league?\nEither way it has been another season of progress for the Cherries and a top-10 place is surely theirs.\nOpta's prediction: 14.3% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nAndrew: We will qualify for the Champions League because Iraola will keep them running and pushing forward until the very last second of the very last game.\nJules: Bournemouth play an aggressive game, press hard, never give up and they've got a great manager.\nRoss: Andoni Iraola has transformed Bournemouth and he and the team deserve it.\nRaul Jimenez is Fulham's top scorer with 10 goals in the Premier League\nFulham are enjoying another excellent season with Marco Silva leading them to an FA Cup quarter-final and keeping them firmly in contention for a European place. The Cottagers are outsiders for a Champions League spot but draws against Arsenal and Liverpool, plus league doubles over Nottingham Forest and Newcastle, have shown what they're capable of.\nKey fixtures: Fulham face the top two in the space of five days in April - Arsenal away followed by Liverpool at Craven Cottage. Then it's Bournemouth and Chelsea before they go to Aston Villa and local rivals Brentford in May, finishing at home to Manchester City.\nPhil McNulty's prediction: Tenth\nFulham have enjoyed another solid season of progress under the excellent coaching of Marco Silva and - add them to the list - will feel they have real chances in the FA Cup after winning on penalties at Manchester United.\nTenth is probably the highest they can reach but that represents another fine campaign. Could the FA Cup provide the icing?\nOpta's prediction: 1.2% chance of a top-five finish\nFan views\nPatrick: Only two more of our league games for the season are against teams below us but we have proven our worth against the elite teams and that mindset will allow us to make it into a Champions League position.\nLuke: We have by far the hardest set of fixtures which I think favours Fulham because we play well against the best.\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

There were other changes too, as health visitors were re-deployed or in contact with parents only online.\nPanorama has heard from families and teachers about the impact on these children, who are just starting or are still in primary school.\nSchools say some have delayed speech and understanding of words, or have slower social or emotional development, or they lack basic skills normally picked up through play.\nProfessor Catherine Davies, from the University of Leeds, says some children missed out on \"fundamental skills\" they need to make sense of school and get on with wider groups.\nAt Queen's Drive Primary School, in Preston, teaching assistant Sarah Barraclough has been trained in a national programme to help four and five-year-olds in England with speech and language.\nShe says the impact of Covid has been \"huge\" and if they don't learn to say and understand more words, children then become isolated. \"You're lonely and not getting involved in the games in the playground,\" she says.\nEmaan, now aged four, was born during the first UK lockdown and is one of the children receiving help through Nuffield Early Language Intervention (NELI).\nHis parents, Ruby and Charles, really notice the difference between Emaan and his older brother.

        "article_text": "To celebrate World Sleep Day, here's our science-based guide to getting the best slumber you can \u2013 from varying sleep with the seasons to taking inspiration from the past.\nIt's a typical weekday morning, and you're just beginning to stir in bed. There's light streaking through the windows, while the many chirps and caws of birds announce that it's probably time to get up\u2026 but surely that can't be right? Cue the familiar feeling of dread, as you remember a night filled with restless, low-quality sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\nAcross the world, people are struggling with insufficient sleep. In the US alone, it's been estimated that between 50 and 70 million people suffer from the affliction, and on a global scale, it has even been called an epidemic. However, there are some simple adjustments \u2013 both psychological and physical \u2013 that might help to improve the quality of your sleep. Here's our guide to having a delicious, restful slumber, inspired by the latest scientific research and some long-forgotten historical tricks.\u00a0\u00a0\nToday, when people wake up in the middle of the night, it's not unusual to panic \u2013 after all, we tend to believe that we should sleep for a continuous eight hours. But this has not always been the case. For millennia, people had a short first sleep \u2013 and then they woke up. These little slumber-gaps were filled with an endless variety of activities, from household chores to gossip in the dark (and even the occasional murder). Then after a couple of hours, people went back to bed and slept through until the morning.\u00a0\nThis is the forgotten ancient practise of \"two sleeps\". It was rediscovered by Roger Ekirch, a university distinguished professor of history at Virginia Tech, Virginia, in the 1990s. He believes that an awareness of the habit's historical prevalence might help to reframe the experiences of those who suffer from insomnia today \u2013 and perhaps lessen their anxiety about waking up in the night. Read more about the lost ancient habit of \"biphasic sleep\" in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs spring arrives, you might notice that you need less sleep and are finding it easier to leave your bed in the morning. Research shows that we need more sleep during the dark, cold winter months than we do during the summer. This is because humans experience seasonal sleep. According to one German study, people experienced both longer REM and deep sleep in December than in June. REM sleep is the most active stage of sleep, when we dream and our heart rate increases, while deep sleep is when the body repairs muscle and tissues and is important for the consolidation of long-term memory.\u00a0Read more about the seasonality of human sleep in this article by Isabelle Gerretsen.\u00a0\nIn many countries having a catnap is a daily ritual, and research shows that regular naps are good for our health. According to a 2023 study, habitual napping helps keep our brains bigger for longer and can delay brain ageing by between three to six years. A smaller brain volume has been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.\nThere are also short-term benefits. Short naps, lasting no longer than 15 minutes, can immediately improve how well we perform mentally, with results lasting up to three hours after we wake up. The key to power naps is to keep them short (after 20 minutes we start drifting into deep sleep) and to make sure you have one mid-afternoon so that it doesn't disrupt your sleep at night. Read more about the health benefits of napping here.\u00a0\nBut not all naps are good for us. Some last mere seconds and these microsleeps can result in serious harm if they occur when you're driving. Analysis of dashcam footage from 52 drivers from a single truck company in Japan found that three quarters of them showed signs of microsleep before they were involved in a collision.\nMicrosleeps are more common among people who suffer from narcolepsy or people who don't get enough sleep at night. One study found that when people slept for just six hours a night for 14 days in a row, they had as many microsleeps as those who missed a whole night's sleep. If you're regularly experiencing microsleeps, it's therefore probably a sign that you're not getting enough sleep generally.\u00a0Read more about the naps that only last a few seconds in this article by Claudia Hammond.\u00a0\nAs we snuggle up in bed for the night \u2013 particularly if it's just with a good podcast \u2013 we might wonder why it's so cold under the covers, or even a bit lonely.\nHistorically, having your own bed was highly unusual. Like it or not, most people had to share \u2013 and not just with their siblings in childhood, or as a married couple. Until the 19th Century, the majority of people would have slept communally, routinely slumbering alongside friends, colleagues and even total strangers. A good bedfellow would provide warmth and conversation into the early hours of the morning \u2013 though you might have to overlook their morning breath and contribution to a bedful of biting parasites. Read more about the forgotten habit of communal sleep in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nHow much sleep we all need can vary from person to person, with most recommendations for between seven and nine hours. But the amount of sleep you get is only one part of the equation. Quality matters as much, if not more.\nMost of us will have experienced feeling less refreshed after a night of tossing and turning. That's partly because when we sleep, our brains flood with cerebrospinal fluid to clear out accumulated debris and toxins. This waste-clearance system is called the glymphatic system, which works best at the same time every day. This means that when we get our shuteye is important. Syncing sleep with our natural circadian rhythms \u2013 the brain's 24-hour internal clock that regulates the cycle of alertness and sleepiness \u2013 gives rise to the best-quality rest.\u00a0Read more about the importance of sleep quality in this feature by Sandy Ong.\u00a0\nToday most people in the Western world are lucky enough to wake up on a soft bed, perhaps with a spring mattress or memory foam. However, things have not always been so comfortable.\u00a0\nIn the medieval era, many people opened their eyes each morning to stuffy air and pitch-blackness \u2013 the conditions inside a \"box bed\". These popular sleeping-cupboards were completely enclosed, and helped to keep people warm at night, though they were sometimes not much bigger than a wardrobe. Slightly later there came the \"tick\" mattress, a bag of cheap materials such as straw or leaves. Unfortunately, they also provided the ideal hiding place for ticks, fleas and bedbugs. But the true inventors of a bad night's sleep might arguably have been the Victorians, who created a variety of unpleasant solutions for homeless people, from rows of coffin-beds to a rope to hang oneself over for a rest. Read more about the curious history of beds through the centuries, or top up your knowledge on why medieval people slept in cupboards, in these articles by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nSo, find yourself some bedfellows, allow for more sleep in the winter, and if you occasionally wake up in the night, consider yourself a modern pioneer of the lost ancient habit of biphasic sleep. We still can't promise that you'll be leaping out of bed on a Monday morning, but it's a start.\u00a0\n--\nThis story was originally published on 15/03/2024.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.",

The impact of a tribunal can be substantial, and there is also the potential for appeals and further hearings that increase the financial impact.\nBut the optics of the last two years, ending in a settlement, aren't good.

        "article_text": "The record for a single trip into space currently stands at 437 days, but prolonged periods in orbit can alter an astronaut's body in some surprising ways, changing their muscles, brains and even their gut bacteria.\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore never intended to stay for nine months. Their initial trip to the International Space Station onboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was scheduled to be just eight days in June 2024. But after technical problems with the spacecraft meant it had to return to Earth without them, their stay in space has been longer than expected.\u00a0\nOf course, neither are new to the rigours of space travel. They are both experienced astronauts. But any extended time in the strange, low gravity environment of space is likely to have affected their bodies. To understand how, we need to look at those who have stayed for longer.\u00a0\nThe longest single spaceflight by an American to date was by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio after he spent 371 days\u00a0living aboard the\u00a0American-football-field-sized collection of modules and solar panels that make up the ISS.\nHis time in orbit \u2013 which surpassed the previous US record of 355 consecutive days \u2013 was extended in March 2023 after the spacecraft he and his crewmates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak. He eventually came home in October 2023. The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km).\nEven so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human \u2013 Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s.\nAnd in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts \u2013 Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub \u2013 broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. The pair departed the ISS in the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft along with US astronaut Tracy Dyson, who had spent six months onboard. With a huge grin on his face, Kononenko gave a double thumbs up as he was helped from the re-entry capsule after it bumped back to Earth in a cloud of dust near the remote town of Dzhezkazgan on the Kazakhstan Steppe. He now also holds the record for the longest cumulative time in space \u2013 a total of 1,111 days in orbit.\nKononenko and Chub travelled more than 158 million miles during their 5,984 orbits of the Earth in the latest mission to the ISS. But spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies, so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams.\nRubio's own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long-duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present. He is the first astronaut to participate in\u00a0a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body.\nWhile the results have yet to be published, it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to explore deeper into the Solar System. A return journey to Mars, for example, is\u00a0expected to take around 1,100 days\u00a0(just over three years) under current plans. The spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS, meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed.\nBut problems keeping fit aside, just what does spaceflight do to the human body?\nMuscles and bones\nWithout the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those\u00a0muscles that help to maintain our posture\u00a0in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps \u2013 in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks\u00a0muscle mass can fall by as much as 20%\u00a0and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%.\nSimilarly, because astronauts are not putting their skeletons through as much mechanical strain as they do when subject to Earth's gravity, their bones also start to demineralise and lose strength. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of their bone mass every month they spend in space and up to 10% over a six-month period (on Earth, older men and women lose bone mass at a rate of 0.5%-1% every year). This can increase their risk of suffering fractures and increase the amount of time it takes to heal. It can take up to four years for their bone mass to return to normal after returning to Earth.\nTo combat this, astronauts undertake 2.5 hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS. This includes a series of squats, deadlifts, rows and bench presses using a resistive exercise device installed in the ISS's \"gym\", alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike. They also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible.\nA recent study, however, highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size. It recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss.\nThe lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly. This can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on Earth. During a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to Earth, Rubio himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening.\n\"I think my spine has extended just enough that I'm kind of wedged into my seat liner, so I shouldn't move much at all,\" he said.\nWeight loss\nAlthough weight means very little while in orbit \u2013 the microgravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely, including human bodies \u2013 maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit. Although Nasa tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods, including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station, it can still affect an astronaut's body. Scott Kelly, a Nasa astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long-term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for 340 days while his twin brother stayed back on Earth, lost 7% of his body mass while in orbit.\nEyesight\nOn Earth, gravity helps to force the blood in our bodies downward while the heart pumps it up again. In space, however, this process becomes messed up (although the body does adapt somewhat), and blood can accumulate in the head more than it normally would. Some of this fluid can pool at the back of the eye and around the optic nerve, leading to oedema. This can lead to changes in vision such as decreased sharpness and structural changes in the eye itself. These changes can start to occur after just two weeks in space but as that time goes on, the risk increases. Some of the vision changes reverse within about a year of astronauts returning to Earth, but others can be permanent.\nExposure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems. The Earth's atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS, this protection disappears. While spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation, astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves.\nNeural shuffling\nAfter his long stay on the ISS, however, Kelly's cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother's on the ground. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home.\nA study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit. It found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function \u2013 in other words, movement \u2013 and also in the vestibular cortex, which plays an important role in orientation, balance and perception of our own motion. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down.\nA more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. Cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles (responsible for storing cerebrospinal fluid, providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste) can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size.\nFriendly bacteria\nIt is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorgansims that live in and on our bodies. This microbiota can influence how we digest food, affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work.\nResearchers examining Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the very different food he was eating and the change in the people he spent his days with (we obtain a horrifying amount of gut and oral microorganisms from the people we live alongside). But exposure to radiation and the use of recycled water, along with changes to his physical activity could all also have played a role. (Find out more about how exercise affects your gut microbes.)\nSkin\nAlthough there have now been five Nasa astronauts who have spent more than 300 days in orbit, we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit. His skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station. Researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint.\nGenes\n\nOne of the most significant findings from Kelly's prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA. At the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as telomeres, which are thought to help protect our genes from damage. As we age, these get shorter, but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these telomeres.\n\"Most striking, however, was the finding of significantly longer telomeres during spaceflight,\" says Susan Bailey, a professor of environmental and radiological health at Colorado State University who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother. She has done separate studies with another 10 unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months. \"Also unexpected was that telomere length shortened rapidly on return to Earth for all crewmembers. Of particular relevance to long-term health and ageing trajectories, astronauts in general had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they did before.\"\nExactly why this happens is still being unravelled, she says. \"We have some clues, but additional long-duration crewmembers \u2013 like Rubio, who spent one year in space \u2013 will be critical to really characterising and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes.\"\nOne possible cause could be exposure to the complex mix of radiation while in space. Astronauts who experience long-term exposure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage, she says.\nThere were also some changes in gene expression \u2013 the mechanism that reads the DNA to produce proteins in cells \u2013 seen in Kelly that may have been related to his journey into space. Some of these related to the body's response to DNA damage, bone formation and the immune system's response to stress. Most of these changes, however, had returned to normal within six months of his return to Earth.\nIn June 2024, a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight. Using gene expression data from samples obtained from the crew of the SpaceX Inspiration 4 mission, who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of 2021, it identified changes in 18 proteins related to the immune system, ageing and muscle growth.\nComparing their gene activity to those of 64 other astronauts on previous missions, the study found in the expression of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight. The men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight, with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to Earth.\nIn particular, the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin-6, which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body, and interleukin-8, which is produced to gulde immune cells to sites of infection, were more affected in the men compared to the women. Another protein, called firbrinogen, which is involved in blood clotting, was also affected more in male astronauts.\nBut the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight, but it could be related to their response to stress.\nYou can hear Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below. With an accumulated 675 days in space, she has spent more time in orbit than any other American, although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has clocked up 878 days in space.\nImmune system\n\nKelly received a series of vaccines before, during and after his trip into space and his immune system\u00a0was found to react normally. But Bailey's research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit.\nThere are still many questions to be answered, however, about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal, big-brained species that evolved to live on Earth. As researchers pour over Rubio's medical tests, blood samples and scans following his 371 days in space, they will doubtless be hoping they will learn more.\n* This article was originally published on 27 September 2023.

        "article_text": "A fashion show held last week in a picturesque, snow-clad town in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked a major controversy that is still simmering.\nThe show, by the well-known fashion brand Shivan & Narresh, was held last Friday at a ski resort in Gulmarg to display their skiwear collection. The label is the first big, non-local brand to hold a fashion show in Kashmir, a scenic Himalayan region which has seen decades of violence.\nBut it soon sparked outrage among locals, politicians and religious leaders in Muslim-majority Kashmir after fashion publisher Elle India posted a video on social media which showed some models wearing underwear or bikinis. Locals were also angry over another video - shared by online magazine Lifestyle Asia - of a party held after the show, which showed people drinking alcohol outdoors.\nMany took offence with the show being held in the holy month of Ramadan - a time of fasting and prayer for Muslims - and accused the designers of \"mocking their faith\" and \"disregarding local culture and sentiments\". Some clerics called the show \"obscene\" and said it was like \"soft porn\". \nSome others explained that the outrage had arisen not only from religious conservatism, but also from a fear of cultural imposition from \"outsiders\". Kashmir has witnessed decades of armed separatist insurgency against Indian rule since the late 1980s. \nThe backlash prompted Elle India and Lifestyle Asia to delete their videos. Shivan Bhatiya and Narresh Kukreja, the designers behind the label, also apologised, saying that their \"sole intention was to celebrate creativity\" and that they didn't intend to offend religious sentiments.\nKashmir - known as the land of saints and Sufism (Islamic mysticism) - has a rich tradition of spirituality which influences many aspects of peoples' lives. The traditional attire is modest, with locals - both men and women - often wearing the pheran, a long, loose cloak.\nThe row also moved off social media and a discussion about the show and the after-party caused a ruckus in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly.\nThe opposition criticised the government, accusing it of giving permission for the event despite being aware of local sensitivities. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah distanced his government from the event, saying it had been organised by private entities, and asking local authorities to investigate the matter and submit a report.\n\"If law has been violated, strict action will be taken,\" he said in the assembly on Monday. The police have not yet given details about who organised the event and what laws, if any, have been violated.\nThe fashion brand did not respond to the BBC's questions about the show, including about permissions it obtained.\nIt's not surprising that scenic Gulmarg - one of India's few skiing destinations and a favourite with tourists - was the choice of venue for a show highlighting a skiwear collection.\nFashion journalist Shefalee Vasudev says it's not uncommon for designers to want to hold fashion shows in exquisite locations.\nIn fact, international designers like Alexander McQueen and Karl Lagerfeld are remembered as much for their creative, theatrical fashion shows as they are for their iconic designs.\nBut experimentation brings with it the risk of controversy and so, it's important to be mindful of the political and cultural sensitivities of a place, Ms Vasudev told the BBC.\nAnd this holds especially true in a place like Kashmir, which has witnessed wars and decades of armed conflict.\nBoth India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the territory.\nThousands of people have been killed since the late 1980s, when a separatist insurgency broke out against Indian rule. Though the separatist movement has lost steam over the years, many locals continue to view the administration in Delhi with distrust.\nThese sentiments have deepened since 2019 when the federal government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, stripped the region of its autonomy.\nSo some locals told the BBC that they were not surprised by the reactions to the show.\n\"Everything in Kashmir is political; people see things through a political prism,\" says Mir, a professor at a local university (he asked for his surname to be withheld to protect his identity). He adds that people are sceptical about big corporate events like the fashion show and - even if they are organised by private players - they believe that the government is trying to dilute their culture.\nArshid Ahmad, a researcher, uses stronger words to express public angst. \"The government is trying to dilute the spirit of resistance in Kashmiris,\" he says.\nThis isn't the first time an event held by non-locals has triggered a controversy in Kashmir. In 2013, separatists and human rights activists in the region protested against a show by renowned conductor Zubin Mehta. They said it was an attempt by the government to show the world that all was well in Kashmir when people were \"suffering and dying\".\nSome of the recent apprehensions around culture and identity can also be tied to the increase in tourists to Kashmir from other states in India. The federal government has often connected this boom in tourism to the abrogation of Article 370, which stripped the region of its autonomy.\nNousheen Fatima, 34, says because of government messaging, people outside Kashmir now see the region as being safer and \"more assimilated with India\".

        "article_text": "Stylish and experimental, Breathless heralded a new era of film-making when it was released 65 years ago. In 1964, its director told the BBC why he broke every rule he could.\nJean-Luc Godard was crystal clear about what he planned to do with his feature-length film debut, Breathless (\u00c0 bout de souffle), which was released 65 years ago this month. He wanted to blow up the whole idea of what cinema was. In 1964, the director told the BBC's Olivier Todd: \"It was a film which took everything the cinema had done \u2013 girls, gangsters, cars \u2013 exploded all this and put an end once and for all to the old style.\"\u00a0\nStylish and semi-improvised, Breathless seemed revolutionary when it hit French screens on 16 March 1960. With its fragmented editing, offbeat dialogue and nonchalant approach to storytelling, it helped rewrite the language of modern cinema. As renowned US film critic Roger Ebert wrote: \"No debut film since Citizen Kane in 1942 has been as influential.\"\nOn its surface, Breathless's plot resembles that of a hard-boiled crime thriller. It tells the story of amoral, impulsive petty criminal Michel Poiccard (played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his doomed relationship with the enigmatic Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg), an American journalism student living in Paris. The film's plot plays out as Michel tries to evade arrest after murdering a policeman: he struggles to collect the money necessary to fund his escape and to convince the ambivalent Patricia to flee with him to Italy. But its director was not so much concerned with its crime narrative as he was with shattering cinematic conventions.\u00a0\nBorn in 1930 to wealthy Franco-Swiss parents, Godard had spent the decade preceding Breathless's release immersed in cinema. At the beginning of the 1950s he had begun working as a film critic for the influential French magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma. When he started, French cinema was dominated by studio-produced literary adaptations which valued polished storytelling over innovation. Godard, along with his fellow cinephiles at the magazine, railed against these films, arguing that they failed to capture any real emotion or show how people really behaved.\nAt the same time, US films that had been banned during the Nazi occupation were being shown in French cinemas. Following the Second World War, France had signed the Blum-Byrnes agreements which had opened up its markets to US products in return for eradicating its war debt. This led to a flood of US films that were enthusiastically embraced by these young French critics. They especially admired westerns and detective thrillers \u2013 genres they regarded as critically underappreciated. It was Italian-born French film critic Nino Frank who coined the term film noir or dark film. The Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma writers also revered film-makers who could stamp their own unique creative visions onto Hollywood productions, such as Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. They regarded these directors as the true \"auteurs\" or authors of those films, rather than the studio which produced them or the stars who appeared in them.\nThroughout the 1950s, these critics would debate and discuss the shortcomings of French cinema while developing their own ideas of what it should be. Many of the writers Godard worked alongside at Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, such as Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, \u00c9ric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol, would also end up becoming directors and leading proponents of the influential movement that would become known as La Nouvelle Vague (The New Wave).\u00a0\nWith Breathless, Godard saw his chance to put the ideas he and his friends discussed into practice. He explained to the BBC in 1964 that he purposely set out to break rules he felt were holding back cinema. \"Conventions were exploded to make something with the remains, just as the debris is collected after an explosion. And when there is nothing useful left, we can start from scratch on fresh ground,\" he said.\nThe film's story was written by Truffaut, who based it loosely on a 1952 news article about a Paris criminal, Michel Portail. However, when Godard came to filming, he would pretty much abandon Truffaut's script. Instead, he got his actors to improvise scenes, or he would feed them lines from behind the camera while filming. This gave the dialogue a spontaneous and personal feel. But it meant that much of Breathless needed to be shot sequentially, so Belmondo and Seberg would know what had happened earlier in the story.\nDue to its limited budget, Godard's plan was to make the cheapest film possible. So instead of shooting in a studio where he would be able to control the lighting, the sound and the set, he took to the streets of Paris with his cinematographer, Raoul Coutard, who filmed on location using a lightweight handheld camera and relying on natural light. The camera, while portable and effective at filming in low-light conditions, was both noisy and unable to record synchronised sound. This meant that nearly all of the improvised lines of dialogue needed to be written down as Belmondo and Seberg ad-libbed, and then dubbed in post-production. This resulted in the later recorded dialogue often not matching the actors' lips, leading to debates that continue to this day about what the characters are actually saying.\nBecause much of Breathless's guerilla-style filming was done without permits or permission, random people going about their everyday lives in Paris's bustling streets and cafes were often captured in shot, lending an authenticity to its depiction of life in the city. Coutard had been a war photographer, and his reportage style of filming captured an immediacy and intimacy that made the film seem, at times, documentary-like. His camera moves restlessly around, capturing small everyday moments as the characters meet, talk and hang out. Sometimes the camera almost seems to be a participant in the action, sitting in the passenger seat of the car Michel has just stolen while he talks to it as if it were a friend. Breathless's lack of a conventional film crew added to its inventiveness. One of its most famous scenes, where Michel and Patricia are seen walking down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es chatting as she advertises a newspaper, was achieved by Godard pulling Coutard along in a wheelchair while he filmed the actors walking towards him.\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\n\"The freedom of shooting on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, Jean Seberg walking down the curb with her unforgettable chanting, 'New York Herald Tribune'. It was like the invention of a mythology for me,\" the Italian director of Last Tango in Paris and The Last Emperor, Bernardo Bertolucci, told the BBC's The Film Programme in 2009.\nBut Godard wasn't trying to convince audiences that they were seeing unfiltered reality. He had been influenced by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht, who believed that a story could so absorb an audience that they became passive and unthinking. So, to keep viewers critically engaged, Brecht would remind them that they were watching a play and not real life.\nGodard embraced this idea, using a range of stylistic devices to make it impossible for viewers to forget that they were watching a film. Characters regularly break the fourth wall, addressing their dialogue directly to the audience. Often, they comment on their own situation, shaking the viewer's feeling of being an unseen spectator. And while a typical film's soundtrack subtly suggests the mood of a scene, in Breathless the music starts and stops suddenly, often disconnected from what is happening on screen at the time.\u00a0\nBut it was Godard's rejection of the usual cinematic editing rules that would become the signature of the film. \"I was incredibly passionate about the style, the language of \u00c0 bout de souffle,\" Bertolucci told the BBC. \"There were these jump cuts, for example. At school they were always telling you how to avoid jump cuts which were considered mistakes, and the movie was full of jump cuts.\"\nBreathless's use of jump cuts \u2013 abrupt transitions forward in time within the same scene \u2013 came about partly by accident. The finished film turned out to be much longer than intended, and Godard needed a way to cut it down to a manageable length. But instead of dropping whole scenes or sequences, the director chose to condense its running time by cutting out sections within takes. Often, he removes material from a continuous shot of movement or dialogue while making no attempt to match the edits, breaking the viewer's immersion in the film and giving it an energetic, skittish rhythm.\nThis jittery editing style lent Breathless a feeling of unpredictability, grabbing the audience's attention and forcing them to be aware of the film-making process. Godard also did this by referencing other films, while at the same time subverting the very conventions that make those films work. Otto Preminger's 1950 film noir thriller Whirlpool is playing when Patricia enters a cinema in an effort to lose the police trailing her. In another scene, when she looks through a rolled-up poster at Michel, the shot mimics a scene in the western Forty Guns (1957) which is seen through a gun barrel. The admired French director of gangster films, Jean-Pierre Melville, has a cameo appearance playing a fictional celebrity author, while Godard himself crops up as a bystander on the street who recognises the fugitive Michel from the newspaper articles.\u00a0\nIn another homage to Godard's influences, the protagonist, Michel, dresses like his hero Humphrey Bogart and practises trying to emulate his onscreen mannerisms. At one point, while gazing at the poster for Bogart's last film, The Harder They Fall (1956), he whispers \"Bogey\" in admiration. But Michel's behaviour, unlike that of a Bogart hero, comes across as neither heroic nor courageous. He displays no conscience over his crimes or remorse over his actions. His girlfriend, Patricia, who goes on to betray him to the police, could be seen as a classic femme fatale character, but instead of being driven by passion, their relationship seems oddly detached and her motives remain opaque. The meaning in Breathless is never simply spelt out for its audience, and its freewheeling plot and morally ambiguous characters provide no easy answers. The film leaves it to the viewer to come to their own interpretations and judgements.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0How Easy Rider revolutionised Hollywood\n\u2022\u00a0The classic western that made Clint Eastwood a star\n\u2022\u00a0The cult erotic film that became a global hit\nWith its distinctive storytelling, imaginative camerawork and photogenic young leads, who imbued it with an effortless sense of cool, Breathless was an immediate critical and commercial hit. It seemed to capture the mood of the times and people flocked to see it. \"They were in a sense ready for it,\" Professor James Williams told Kirsty Lang on the BBC's Last Word in 2022. \"I mean, people wanted something new and different.\" It would go on to win Godard the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 1960 Berlin International Film Festival.\nFor the aspiring directors who saw Breathless, its effect was electric. \"As a potential film-maker, it was like just being free, it was like being on a drug or something. It was just amazing,\" Get Carter's director Mike Hodges told the BBC's The Film Programme in 2006.\n\"It broke all the rules \u2013 and rules of film-making are quite frightening in many ways. You've got to get the angles right, and you have lines that you don't cross. This was in the classical tradition. So in a sense, cinema was very like the classical painters, whereas when you saw Godard's film, it was like the impressionists coming to life, but on the screen.\"\nBreathless's impact would be felt in many of the US films that followed its release, with Godard influencing the Hollywood studios that had so affected him. Breathless's characters' moral ambiguity and its abrupt shifts in tone could be seen in Bonnie and Clyde (1967), its innovative camera angles and examination of relationship uncertainty were reflected in The Graduate (1967), and its low-budget filming techniques and improvised dialogue were embraced in Easy Rider (1969).\u00a0\nIn the 1970s, a slew of young directors inspired by the French New Wave, such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, would put their own singular \"auteur\" visions of cinema on the screen. The director Quentin Tarantino, who named his production company A Band Apart, after Godard's 1964 film Bande \u00e0 part, has long acknowledged the effect the director had on him. He told Film Comment in a 1994 interview that \"Godard did to movies what Bob Dylan did to music: they both revolutionised their forms\".\nPart of Breathless's continuing influence on film-makers is in persuading them that it is possible for the viewer to do just what Godard did. As Shaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright wrote after Godard died in 2022: \"It was ironic that he himself revered the Hollywood studio film-making system, as perhaps no other director inspired as many people to just pick up a camera and start shooting.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Listen to Esme read this article\nDonald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.\nSince taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.\nPlus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\".\nAnd yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals.\nCritical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.\nSo, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?\nTrump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).\nElizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.\nShe says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.\nWithin two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.\nSuch has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\"\nHe went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.\nThe weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\"\nFailure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\".\nChina's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.\n\"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.\nDaisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\"\nSome minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.\nChina has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).\n\"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. \nShe says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.\nWhat is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). \n\"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\"\nAs he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology.\nThe key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.\nIn the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward. \nThe Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels. \nBy August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.\nAnd yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.\nBut Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.\n\"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray.\n\"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\"\nThere could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective.\nThe exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.\nAlthough work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\"\nAs a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.\nAnalysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.\nMIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.\nHe adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.\nIf Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation. \nCarl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\"\nHe also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\"\nBut the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\"\nFor those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has signed a constitutional declaration covering a five-year transitional period, three months after his Islamist group led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad.\nThe document says Islam is the religion of the president, as the previous constitution did, and Islamic jurisprudence is \"the main source of legislation\", rather than \"a main source\", according to the drafting committee.\nIt also enshrines separation of powers and judicial independence, and guarantees women's rights, freedom of expression and media freedom.\n\"We hope it will be a new history for Syria, where we replace oppression with justice,\" Sharaa said.\nUN special envoy Geir Pedersen said he welcomed the \"moves towards restoring the rule of law\" and noted that \"this development potentially fills an important legal vacuum\".\nBut the Kurdish-led administration in north-eastern Syria criticised the constitutional declaration, saying it \"contradicts the reality of Syria and its diversity\".\nIn January, rebel military commanders named Sharaa president for the transitional period, cancelled the Assad-era 2012 constitution, and dissolved the former regime's parliament, army and security agencies.\nOnly 10 days ago, Sharaa announced the formation of the seven-member committee to draft the constitutional declaration, which he said would serve as \"the legal framework regulating the transitional phase\".\nA member of the committee, Abdul Hamid al-Awak, a constitutional law expert who teaches at a Turkish university, told a news conference on Thursday that the declaration aimed to \"create a balance between a security society and rights and freedoms\".\nHe said it stipulated \"absolute separation of powers\", pointing to Assad's \"encroachment\" on other branches of government during his 24-year rule.\nThe president would have executive authority during the transitional period, he said, but would have only one \"exceptional power\" \u2013 the ability to declare a state of emergency.\nA new People's Assembly will have full responsibility for legislation. Two thirds of its members will be appointed by a committee selected by the president and one third chosen by the president himself.\nA committee will also be formed to draft a new permanent constitution.\nSharaa has promised an inclusive government that will run the country until the new constitution is finalised and free and fair elections are held.\nHowever, he faces significant challenges following a devastating civil war that erupted when Assad ordered a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests 14 years ago.\nLast week, gunmen supporting Sharaa's Sunni Islamist-led government were accused of carrying out revenge killings against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect in the western coastal region following a deadly ambush on a security patrol by gunmen loyal to the former regime. One monitoring group has said almost 1,500 civilians were killed.\nSharaa has pledged to hold the perpetrators to account and ordered the formation of a committee aimed at preserving civil peace.\nHowever, many Alawites and members of other religious and ethnic minorities are wary of his intentions because of his past as the leader of al-Qaeda's former Syrian affiliate.\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on Thursday that nothing could justify the killing of civilians and warned that Syria's \"much-deserved brighter future hangs in the balance\".\n\"The caretaker authorities have repeatedly committed to building a new Syria based on inclusive and credible foundations for all Syrians.

One monitoring group has said almost 1,500 civilians were killed.Sharaa has pledged to hold the perpetrators to account and ordered the formation of a committee aimed at preserving civil peace.However, many Alawites and members of other religious and ethnic minorities are wary of his intentions because of his past as the leader of al-Qaeda's former Syrian affiliate.UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on Thursday that nothing could justify the killing of civilians and warned that Syria's \"much-deserved brighter future hangs in the balance\".

        "article_text": "To celebrate World Sleep Day, here's our science-based guide to getting the best slumber you can \u2013 from varying sleep with the seasons to taking inspiration from the past.\nIt's a typical weekday morning, and you're just beginning to stir in bed. There's light streaking through the windows, while the many chirps and caws of birds announce that it's probably time to get up\u2026 but surely that can't be right? Cue the familiar feeling of dread, as you remember a night filled with restless, low-quality sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\nAcross the world, people are struggling with insufficient sleep. In the US alone, it's been estimated that between 50 and 70 million people suffer from the affliction, and on a global scale, it has even been called an epidemic. However, there are some simple adjustments \u2013 both psychological and physical \u2013 that might help to improve the quality of your sleep. Here's our guide to having a delicious, restful slumber, inspired by the latest scientific research and some long-forgotten historical tricks.\u00a0\u00a0\nToday, when people wake up in the middle of the night, it's not unusual to panic \u2013 after all, we tend to believe that we should sleep for a continuous eight hours. But this has not always been the case. For millennia, people had a short first sleep \u2013 and then they woke up. These little slumber-gaps were filled with an endless variety of activities, from household chores to gossip in the dark (and even the occasional murder). Then after a couple of hours, people went back to bed and slept through until the morning.\u00a0\nThis is the forgotten ancient practise of \"two sleeps\". It was rediscovered by Roger Ekirch, a university distinguished professor of history at Virginia Tech, Virginia, in the 1990s. He believes that an awareness of the habit's historical prevalence might help to reframe the experiences of those who suffer from insomnia today \u2013 and perhaps lessen their anxiety about waking up in the night. Read more about the lost ancient habit of \"biphasic sleep\" in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs spring arrives, you might notice that you need less sleep and are finding it easier to leave your bed in the morning. Research shows that we need more sleep during the dark, cold winter months than we do during the summer. This is because humans experience seasonal sleep. According to one German study, people experienced both longer REM and deep sleep in December than in June. REM sleep is the most active stage of sleep, when we dream and our heart rate increases, while deep sleep is when the body repairs muscle and tissues and is important for the consolidation of long-term memory.\u00a0Read more about the seasonality of human sleep in this article by Isabelle Gerretsen.\u00a0\nIn many countries having a catnap is a daily ritual, and research shows that regular naps are good for our health. According to a 2023 study, habitual napping helps keep our brains bigger for longer and can delay brain ageing by between three to six years. A smaller brain volume has been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.\nThere are also short-term benefits. Short naps, lasting no longer than 15 minutes, can immediately improve how well we perform mentally, with results lasting up to three hours after we wake up. The key to power naps is to keep them short (after 20 minutes we start drifting into deep sleep) and to make sure you have one mid-afternoon so that it doesn't disrupt your sleep at night. Read more about the health benefits of napping here.\u00a0\nBut not all naps are good for us. Some last mere seconds and these microsleeps can result in serious harm if they occur when you're driving. Analysis of dashcam footage from 52 drivers from a single truck company in Japan found that three quarters of them showed signs of microsleep before they were involved in a collision.\nMicrosleeps are more common among people who suffer from narcolepsy or people who don't get enough sleep at night. One study found that when people slept for just six hours a night for 14 days in a row, they had as many microsleeps as those who missed a whole night's sleep. If you're regularly experiencing microsleeps, it's therefore probably a sign that you're not getting enough sleep generally.\u00a0Read more about the naps that only last a few seconds in this article by Claudia Hammond.\u00a0\nAs we snuggle up in bed for the night \u2013 particularly if it's just with a good podcast \u2013 we might wonder why it's so cold under the covers, or even a bit lonely.\nHistorically, having your own bed was highly unusual. Like it or not, most people had to share \u2013 and not just with their siblings in childhood, or as a married couple. Until the 19th Century, the majority of people would have slept communally, routinely slumbering alongside friends, colleagues and even total strangers. A good bedfellow would provide warmth and conversation into the early hours of the morning \u2013 though you might have to overlook their morning breath and contribution to a bedful of biting parasites. Read more about the forgotten habit of communal sleep in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nHow much sleep we all need can vary from person to person, with most recommendations for between seven and nine hours. But the amount of sleep you get is only one part of the equation. Quality matters as much, if not more.\nMost of us will have experienced feeling less refreshed after a night of tossing and turning. That's partly because when we sleep, our brains flood with cerebrospinal fluid to clear out accumulated debris and toxins. This waste-clearance system is called the glymphatic system, which works best at the same time every day. This means that when we get our shuteye is important. Syncing sleep with our natural circadian rhythms \u2013 the brain's 24-hour internal clock that regulates the cycle of alertness and sleepiness \u2013 gives rise to the best-quality rest.\u00a0Read more about the importance of sleep quality in this feature by Sandy Ong.\u00a0\nToday most people in the Western world are lucky enough to wake up on a soft bed, perhaps with a spring mattress or memory foam. However, things have not always been so comfortable.\u00a0\nIn the medieval era, many people opened their eyes each morning to stuffy air and pitch-blackness \u2013 the conditions inside a \"box bed\". These popular sleeping-cupboards were completely enclosed, and helped to keep people warm at night, though they were sometimes not much bigger than a wardrobe. Slightly later there came the \"tick\" mattress, a bag of cheap materials such as straw or leaves. Unfortunately, they also provided the ideal hiding place for ticks, fleas and bedbugs. But the true inventors of a bad night's sleep might arguably have been the Victorians, who created a variety of unpleasant solutions for homeless people, from rows of coffin-beds to a rope to hang oneself over for a rest. Read more about the curious history of beds through the centuries, or top up your knowledge on why medieval people slept in cupboards, in these articles by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nSo, find yourself some bedfellows, allow for more sleep in the winter, and if you occasionally wake up in the night, consider yourself a modern pioneer of the lost ancient habit of biphasic sleep. We still can't promise that you'll be leaping out of bed on a Monday morning, but it's a start.\u00a0\n--\nThis story was originally published on 15/03/2024.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Mark Carney, an economist and political newcomer, has been sworn in as Canada's new prime minister, and delivered remarks vowing to \"never\" become a part of the United States.\nHe took office on Friday just days after being elected leader of the governing Liberal Party and amid an ongoing trade war with US President Donald Trump.\n\"We know that by building together, we can give ourselves far more than anyone else can take away,\" he said after the ceremony. \nCarney replaces outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in office for nine years, after a landslide victory in last week's Liberal leadership race. \n\"We will never, in any shape or form, be part of the US,\" Carney told reporters in Ottawa on Friday, referring to Trump's musings that Canada join the US as its \"51st state\".\n\"We are very fundamentally a different country,\" he said, later adding the notion is \"crazy\". \nHe declined to answer questions about the timing of Canada's next federal election - currently scheduled for October - but hinted he would move quickly to seek \"as strong a mandate that is needed for the time\".\nIn his first order as prime minister, Carney moved to end a policy that had been frequent attacked against by political opponents. \nHe ended the consumer carbon pricing programme - a key environmental policy under Trudeau that had become deeply unpopular in recent years amid high inflation. \nConservatives have criticised the tax, saying it raised the price of goods and energy for Canadian families.\nAt an afternoon cabinet meeting, Carney said his government will still take steps to fight climate change. An industrial carbon tax on large emitters remains in place. \nCanadians receive a rebate to offset the cost of carbon pricing and will get their final cheque in April.\nCanadian politics in recent months have largely been overshadowed by the trade war Trump launched after taking office in January - and with a general election on the horizon, Carney is expected to pitch himself as the candidate best equipped to take on Trump. \nHe previously held roles as governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, and of the Bank of England, and helped both countries weather major financial disruption. \nHe intends to travel to the UK and France as his first foreign trip as PM next week.\nCarney said he also looks forward to speaking with Trump. \n\"We respect the United States. We respect President Trump,\" he said.\n\"President Trump is has put some very important issues at the top of his agenda.\"\nCarney has promised to uphold Canada's reciprocal tariffs on specific American goods for as long as Trump maintains 25% universal tariffs on Canadian goods not  covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) trade deal.\nCanada is dependent on trade with the US. Economists say it risks a recession if Trump's tariffs are fully imposed. \nSeveral of Carney's new cabinet members served under Trudeau, and in particular he kept on those who have been working directly with the Trump administration in recent months. \nThey including M\u00e9lanie Joly, who remains in foreign affairs; David McGuinty, who remains in public safety; Jonathan Wilkinson, staying on as energy minister; Dominic Leblanc, who has moved from finance to trade; and Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, moved from industry to finance. \nWhen the federal election comes, Carney's main rival will be Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre. \nBefore the the threat of tariffs, Conservatives enjoyed a 20-point lead in some election polls. Now polls are indicating a much closer race. \nSpeaking after Carney on Friday, Poilievre argued that Liberals do not deserve a fourth term in office, arguing adding they have already had nine years to improve affordability and other issues in the country.\n\"It will be the same Liberal results,\" he said. \nPoilievre added that if he were to be elected prime minister, he would \"face off against President Trump directly, respond with counter tariffs and take back control\".\nWhen Canadians next go to the polls, the Liberals will face not only the Conservatives - who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons - but also the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats, and the New Democrats (NDP), who have 24.\nReacting to Carney's swearing in, the leader of the NDP argued that his cabinet appointments show that there is no room for progressive Liberals under his leadership. \nJagmeet Singh said that he had failed to create separate cabinet portfolios for minister of women, youth, or people with disabilities, and described Carney as someone who has made billionaires \"very rich at the cost of workers\".",

        "article_text": "Custard powder makes a delicious dessert but also has a rather less savoury potential \u2013 in certain conditions, it can be a powerful explosive.\nInstant custard powder is a staple of many kitchens. Just add water and heat, and the powdery mixture of cornstarch and flavourings will transform into an unctuous treat. It's hard to imagine anything more inoffensive. But on 18 November 1981, at the Bird's Custard factory in Oxfordshire, the substance showed its dark side. A hopper of powder overflowed, and the resulting dust cloud ignited, exploding into flame.\nNine people were injured in the explosion. They were lucky \u2013 powder explosions can be lethal. Fourteen people were killed in Minnesota in 1871 when a flour mill went up. Forty-four people, including a child, lost their lives to a cornstarch-based explosion in 1919 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which levelled part of the town. \"The main explosion seemed to lift great buildings and hold them in tension for a moment, letting them drop with their own weight,\" one observer wrote later.\nDust explosions, of various substances, have continued to take lives \u2013 in 2014, 97 people died when dust in a factory in Kunshan, China, ignited. In 2022, one industry report counted 50 such explosions globally, although not all of them involved foodstuffs.\nHow can the makings for a simple dessert cause carnage, though? In all dust explosions, there are a few common factors. The powder must be made of a flammable substance \u2013 that means you're safe from sand, which is made of minerals like silica. But flour, cornstarch, sugar, coal dust, powdered plastic, and aluminium powder can all burn, meaning that if they get airborne, the risk for a truly devastating explosion goes up.\nThat's because, suspended in a cloud, all those particles have an enormous surface area exposed to oxygen. That makes them swift to combust. If a few of them heat up to ignition \u2013 and in each of these cases, there was a source of heat like friction or static electricity involved \u2013 then the fire can spread almost instantaneously to the rest of the cloud. Like a pile of confetti ignited in a fireplace, suspended dust burns fast.\nThat evening at the Bird's Custard factory, there were 20 workers on duty. Several noticed that cornstarch was pouring out of the top of one of the bins, according to the accident report. \"At this point several witnesses saw a flash near the top of the bin and a wall of flame spreading outwards and downwards from the bin top,\" the report continues. \"Descriptions were of a gale-force wind with a flame front behind, which flashed through the area.\" Later inspection revealed that the machinery meant to pour cornstarch into various bins had malfunctioned, so cornstarch continued to pour into the container until it overflowed.\u00a0\u00a0\nKeeping the risk of such explosions down means coming at the problem from many angles \u2013 grounding all the machines in a factory to reduce static electricity, building in filtration systems that remove dust from the air, and diligent patrolling for any dust build-up are all recommended by health and safety agencies.\nLook at a spoonful of cornstarch or custard powder, and it is nearly impossible to imagine it as an engine of destruction. Very few of us have any direct experience of these events, so it is hard to see these substances the way you might see a sheet of paper held near a candle, or a cigarette smouldering by a pile of leaves, as an accident waiting to happen.\u00a0\nThere are situations in which you might encounter this dangerous chemistry in real life, however, outside of a custard factory or flour silo.\nParties in which coloured powder, often cornstarch, is shot into crowds, inspired by the Hindu festival of Holi, are popular spring-time events. In 2015, at a water park in Taiwan, coloured cornstarch sprayed over a concert audience ignited, provoking a maelstrom in which more than 500 people were injured. Twenty people died as a result of their injuries.\nMore like this\n\u2022\u00a0The odd-tasting oil that packed a healthy punch\n\u2022\u00a0What we owe the humble lentil\n\u2022\u00a0Gelatine: the ingredient with the wonder wobble\nThe park's management stated that they had no knowledge that such explosive fires were possible as a result of cornstarch clouds. In fact, coloured powders are often sold with labels incorrectly marking them as non-flammable, a team of scientists found in 2023 when they tested the combustible qualities of various powders.\nAt Bird's Custard, that day in 1981, the wall of flame thankfully did not kick up any dust that could have provoked a secondary explosion. But it's not uncommon for dust explosions to go from bad to worse as lingering dust is kicked up and rises into the air. The only way to prevent these disasters is to pre-empt them, say consultants who assess the risks for companies.\nKeep spaces where powders are used clean, patrol for sources of heat and, above all, have a healthy respect for the destructive potential in innocent, edible powder like custard.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of an escalating trade war.\nThe threat is a response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of its retaliation to Trump's tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US.\nThe US president called for the immediate removal of the EU's \"nasty\" tariff on US whiskey, calling the bloc \"hostile and abusive\" and \"formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States\".\nA European Commission spokesperson said that \"calls are being prepared\" between between the US and the EU to discuss the situation.\nIt confirmed that its trade commissioner, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, had \"reached out to his American counterparts\" after Trump's latest threat.\nThe stand-off marked another escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets and raised concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US.\nEurope sends more than \u20ac4.5bn ($4.89bn; \u00a33.78bn) worth of wine each year to the US, which is its largest export market, according to the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins, which represents the European wine industry.\nIgnacio S\u00e1nchez Recarte, secretary-general of the group, said if Trump carried through on his threats, it would destroy the market, costing thousands of jobs.\n\"There is no alternative to sell all this wine,\" he said, pleading with the two sides to \"keep wine out of this fight\".\nThe latest clash came after new US tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on Wednesday, hitting imports of the metals with a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions from the duties that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries, including from the EU and Canada.\nCanada and Europe - which are among America's biggest trade partners - called the new taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products. The EU's measures are due to go into force 1 April. \nThe clash reprises a battle that played out during Trump's first term, when he first announced tariffs on steel and aluminium. \nThe EU responded with its own tariffs, including a 25% tax on American whiskey.\nIn the aftermath, whiskey sales to the EU dropped 20%, falling from roughly $552m in 2018 to $440m in 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. Trump in turn\nThe tariffs were lifted after Trump left office, after the two sides reached an agreement that exempted a certain amount of European metals from the duties.\nBut Trump has indicated little appetite for deal-making so far, at least when it comes to steel and aluminium.\n\"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the US will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all wines, champagnes & alcoholic products coming out of France and other EU represented countries,\" he wrote on social media, using all capital letters for some of the message. \nThe targeting of wine and whiskey is symbolic - there are few consumer goods more iconic than French Bordeaux or Tennessee whiskey. From a value standpoint, drinks trade is worth less than some of the other items facing tariffs.\nBut Mary Taylor, a US-based importer of European wines, said the measures would be catastrophic for her business and industry, with an impact that would ripple out to restaurants, bars and distributors across the US. \n\"It just looks like a big, giant threat to our livelihoods,\"  she said.\nMs Taylor, who brings in 2 million bottles a year, weathered the 25% tariff Trump put on certain EU bottles during his first term by expanding her distribution in Europe, but she said, \"200% is a whole different ball game\".\nShares in the US fell again on Thursday. \nThe S&P 500 dropped nearly 1.4%, taking it down roughly 10% from its most recent peak - a milestone known as a correction. The Dow slumped 1.3%, while the Nasdaq dropped almost 2%. \nIn Europe, London's FTSE 100 was flat, while Germany's Dax ended about 0.5% lower. \nIn Paris, the Cac 40 fell 0.6%, as shares of major spirit-makers were hit, with Pernod Ricard down 4% and Hennessy cognac maker LVMH falling 1.1%.\nIn interviews with US business media on Thursday, White House officials blamed the EU for escalating the dispute.\n\"Why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon or Harley-Davidson motorcycles? It's disrespectful,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television, describing the back-and-forth as \"off the topic\".\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that a trade war was likely to inflict more economic pain on the EU than on the US, dismissing concerns that the clash could spiral.\n\"One or two items, with one trading bloc \u2013 I'm not sure why that's a big deal for the markets,\" he said.\nIn an interview with the BBC's HardTalk, European central bank president Christine Lagarde, said that the EU had \"no choice\" but to retaliate.\n\"At the moment, everybody is positioning,\" she said, adding that she expected the two sides to sit down and negotiate.\n\"Everybody will suffer\" if the dispute were to develop into a full blown trade war, she warned.\nSo far, Trump has shown little tolerance for retaliation from countries over the tariffs he has introduced.\nEarlier this week, he blasted Canada with the threat of a 50% tariff on its steel and aluminium after the Canadian province of Ontario responded to new tariffs with a surcharge on electricity exports to the US.\nHe rescinded that threat after Ontario agreed to suspend the charges.\nFormer Trump adviser Stephen Moore, now an economist with the Heritage Foundation, said he thought the EU would have to make a concession to defuse the situation, noting that Trump had consistently voiced concerns about rules on agricultural products.\n\"Absolutely this is going to end up with a deal,\" he said. \"It's only a question if it ends up in a deal in a day, a week, a month or six months, but there will eventually be a negotiated settlement.\" \nThe full HARDtalk will be available from 14 March on the BBC News Channel, iPlayer, the World Service and as a podcast.",

        "article_text": "Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic \u2013 and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\nWhen Tadas Eidukevi\u010dius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Vladimir Putin has said he agrees with the idea of a ceasefire in Ukraine, but that \"questions\" remain about the nature of a truce - as he set out a number of tough conditions for peace.\nThe Russian president was responding to a plan for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine agreed to earlier this week following talks with the US. \nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described Putin's response to the plan as \"manipulative\" and called for more sanctions on Russia. \nMeanwhile, the US placed further sanctions on Russian oil, gas and banking sectors.\nRussian officials said Putin was expected to hold talks on the ceasefire on Thursday evening with US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, who had flown to Moscow earlier that day. \nIt is not clear whether that meeting actually took place. On Friday, Russia's state media quoted the air traffic monitor Flightradar as saying the plane believed to be carrying Witkoff had left Moscow.\nMoscow and Washington have not commented on the issue.\nLate on Thursday and overnight, both Russia and Ukraine reported new enemy drone attacks. \nUkraine said seven people - including children - were injured in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv.\nRussia reported a large fire at an oil facility in the southern city of Tuapse. \nSpeaking at a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Putin said of the ceasefire proposal: \"The idea is right - and we support it - but there are questions that we need to discuss.\"\nA ceasefire should lead to \"an enduring peace and remove the root causes of this crisis\", Putin said. \n\"We need to negotiate with our American colleagues and partners,\" he said. \"Maybe I'll have a call with Donald Trump.\"\nPutin added: \"It will be good for the Ukrainian side to achieve a 30-day ceasefire.\n\"We are in favour of it, but there are nuances.\"\nOne of the areas of contention is Russia's western Kursk region, Putin said, where Ukraine launched a military incursion last August and captured some territory. \nHe claimed Russia was fully back in control of Kursk, and said Ukrainian troops there \"have been isolated\".\n\"They are trying to leave, but we are in control. Their equipment has been abandoned,\" Putin said.\n\"There are two options for Ukrainians in Kursk - surrender or die.\"\nUkraine's top commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said a day earlier that Ukrainian troops would hold defensive positions in the Kursk region \"as long as it is expedient and necessary\" despite \"increased\" pressure from Russian forces.\nAt Thursday's press conference, Putin also outlined some of his questions over how a ceasefire would work. He asked: \"How will those 30 days be used? For Ukraine to mobilise? Rearm? Train people? Or none of that? Then a question - how will that be controlled?\n\"Who will give the order to end the fighting? At what cost? Who decides who has broken any possible ceasefire, over 2,000km? All those questions need meticulous work from both sides. Who polices it?\"\nPutin \"doesn't say no directly\", Zelensky said in his nightly video address, but \"in practice, he's preparing a rejection\".\nHe added: \"Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, wants to kill Ukrainians.\" \nThe Russian leader had set so many pre-conditions \"that nothing will work out at all\", Zelensky said. \nAfter Putin's remarks and Zelensky's response, there is now a clear divide between both sides' positions. \nUkraine wants a two-stage process: a quick ceasefire and then talks about a longer-term settlement. \nRussia believes you cannot separate the two processes and all the issues should be decided in a single deal. Both sides seem content to argue their differences. \nUkraine believes it can put pressure on Russia, painting it as a reluctant peacemaker, playing for time. Russia, equally, believes it has a chance now to raise its fundamental concerns, about Nato expansion and Ukraine's sovereignty. \nBut this presents a problem for Donald Trump. He has made it clear he wants a quick result, ending the fighting in days. \nAnd right now, Putin does not appear to want to play ball. \nSpeaking at the White House following Putin's remarks, Trump said he would \"love\" to meet the Russian leader and that he hoped Russia would \"do the right thing\" and agree to the proposed 30-day truce. \n\"We'd like to see a ceasefire from Russia,\" he said. \nSpeaking earlier at a meeting in the Oval Office with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump told reporters he had already discussed specifics with Ukraine.\n\"We've been discussing with Ukraine land and pieces of land that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement,\" Trump said.\n\"A lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed.\"\nOn the subject of Ukraine joining the Nato military alliance, Trump said \"everybody knows what the answer to that is\".\nThe fresh sanctions on Russian oil and gas came as the Trump administration further restricted access to US payment systems, making it harder for other countries to buy Russian oil.\nEarlier in the day, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov rejected the ceasefire proposal put forward by the US.\nOn Wednesday, the Kremlin released a video it said showed Putin visiting Russia's Kursk region, symbolically dressed in military fatigues. Russia later said it recaptured the key town of Sudzha.\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, and now controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\nMore than 95,000 people fighting for Russia's military have been killed in the war, according to data analysed so far and confirmed by the BBC. The actual death toll is believed to be much higher.\nRussia's military has not publicly revealed its battlefield casualties since September 2022, when it said 5,937 soldiers had been killed.\nUkraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian deaths among soldiers and officers. Western analysts believe this figure to be underestimated.",

        "article_text": "In 2019, climate scientist Steffen Olsen took a startling photo of huskies appearing to walk on water. The photo quickly went viral as it revealed the reality of Greenland's rapidly melting ice.\nIn June 2019, a striking image of husky dogs apparently walking on water in Greenland stunned the world and quickly went viral.\nThe photo was taken by Steffen Olsen, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute and lead of Blue Action, a European project which investigates the effect of a changing Arctic on weather and climate.\n\"The reaction surprised me,\" says Olsen. \"It surprised me that so many people saw this as a beautiful photo. I saw it as a scary situation.\"\nThat's because the dogs were in fact wading through ankle-deep meltwater on top of sea ice in Inglefield Bredning, an 80km-long (49.7 miles) system in northwestern Greenland.\n\"I learned to see the photo as an illusion. People don't see sea ice, but dogs walking on water,\" Olsen says.\u00a0\nOlsen captured the photo while travelling with a team of scientists who were monitoring sea and ice conditions near the town of Qaanaaq, one of the world's most northerly towns. They were retrieving scientific instruments they had deployed during the winter.\u00a0\n\"We had been travelling for some hours and it became clear that the melting was very extreme\u2026 [the ice] more or less melted beneath our feet while we were travelling on it,\" says Olsen. \"The local hunters and I were very surprised\u2026 we were searching for dry spots to get the dogs and the sleds out of the water and there were none in sight. We turned around and made it back to the coast.\"\nThe dogs are typically very hesitant to get their paws wet, says Olsen. \"Usually when we meet water, it's because there are cracks in the sea ice and the dogs have to jump over the water\u2026they hate it. But it was actually very warm so I think they were happy to have cold feet,\" he says, adding that temperatures reached 14C (57F) on the day.\nThe scientists managed to retrieve their instruments a few days later once the water had drained away through small cracks in the ice sheet. \"Then you have a short period of time when you can then travel again before the ice collapses and breaks up,\" says Olsen.\nOlsen says he was extremely surprised by the rapid melting he witnessed when he took the photo on 13 June 2019. He has only experienced such an extreme event once during his 15 years carrying out research in Greenland. It's unusual for melting to occur that quickly, Olsen explains.\n\"It requires a sudden onset of warm air while you still have fresh snow on the ice and solid sea ice. So it's an example of an extreme event developing early in the season... The local community have told me: 'you will have to wait 100 years to see [such an event] again'.\"\u00a0\nMelting events such as the one Olsen witnessed would normally not occur until later in the season, in late June and July, but in 2019 melting started in mid-April, around six to eight weeks before the 1981-2020 average, and affected roughly 95% of Greenland's ice sheet, according to the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nSuch early melting events can have a \"snowball effect\" and lead to more melting as there is less snow and ice to reflect the Sun's rays back into space and keep the surface cool, explains Bianca Perren, a paleoclimatologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who studies sediment cores from polar regions to understand the long-term variability of the climate.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Antarctica's upside-down ice-scape we had no idea existed\n\u2022\u00a0The 'mind bomb' photos that changed the whaling industry\n\u2022\u00a0Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change\nGreenland experienced record ice loss in 2019, shedding a total of 532 billion tonnes from its giant ice sheet, according to a 2020 study. On average, Greenland loses 234 billion tonnes of ice per year\u00a0\u2013 enough to pack into 6,324 Empire State Buildings.\n\"2019 was a really unusually warm year, but so was 2012,\" says Kelly Hogan, a marine geophysicist at BAS who studies the impacts of Greenland's melting ice sheet. In 2012, the summer period (June-August) was more than 2C (4F) warmer than the average for 1981-2010, and more than 1.5C (3F) warmer for the entire ice sheet. \"Those extremes are coming round more frequently than we had thought they would. They're happening every few years,\" says Hogan.\n\"What's really distinctive about Greenland is how much melting you get on the surface in the summer, because you don't get anywhere near as much as that in Antarctica,\" says Hogan. \"When you see huge volumes of water [on the ice], it is really shocking.\"\nBut it's rare to see \"giant pools of water\" on the surface like in Olsen's photo, says Perren, as usually the water seeps through cracks in the ice. \"It basically pops the ice sheet up and floats it out to the coast. So often you don't have this pooling of water, but instead you have warm water that's being sent down into the bowels of the Greenland ice sheet, basically warming the whole thing,\" she says.\nThe rapid melting of the ice is already affecting local communities' way of life. \"They are having to adapt the way they hunt and fish,\" says Olsen.\nIf the ice is unsafe to travel on, it also makes it more difficult for scientists to carry out their research, Olsen adds. \"We will have to adapt and rely more on automatic instruments instead of community-based monitoring.\"\u00a0\nSafety is already a concern, says Perren, adding: \"I have promised my son that I will not step foot on the ice sheet because it's so dangerous.\"\nThe photo has helped raise awareness of Greenland's vulnerability to climate change, says Olsen. \"I have definitely found that you can get a lot of attention for the problem with a photo\u2026 so it has been very efficient.\n\"But I've also been challenged by people saying: 'how can you take a photo of climate change?' And I agree, you cannot take one photo and call it climate change, because that is something that unfolds over a longer time period,\" says Olsen. \"We need to explain the photo and provide the right context.\"\nPhotos are useful tools for starting conversation about the environment and explaining scientific phenomena, says Perren. \"Science has a communication problem,\" she says.\n\"When I first saw it in 2019 I remember thinking: 'oh my gosh, this is such a shocking image,'\" adds Perren. \"It's a symbolic image of what climate change looks like in Greenland. But there's also a scientific side to it: maybe this is unprecedented but it also [paints] a very good, kind of emblematic picture of what the future would look like.\"\nHogan says that photo \"really drives home the extent of the problem\". \"It looks like the dogs are skating on something without a bottom\u2026 it feels like they could just sink at any moment, which is maybe some sort of metaphor for the ice sheet and the future.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

Ministers have requested urgent advice on the issue.\"\nAlthough not a cure, abiraterone can help stop prostate cancer spreading to other parts of the body. \nIn England and Northern Ireland, the drug is only approved for men with very advanced prostate cancer which has spread already. \nIn Wales and Scotland, people with the disease that has not yet spread can also get it.\nResearch has shown that for these earlier stage patients, the survival rate after six years is improved and that the drug halved the rate of progression of the cancer.\nThe charity says many lives could be extended by the drug, given the findings from a trial called Stampede, published in 2022. \nIt found improved odds of survival among men given the drug alongside usual care, and concluded that abiraterone should be considered a new standard treatment. \nAccording to figures from NHS England, each year about 8,400 patients have high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread. \nUsing the Stampede assumptions, 672 of those men could die prematurely without access to abiraterone.\nIn October 2023, BBC News spoke to Giles Turner, a retired banker living in Sussex. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year but was told that abiraterone could not be obtained on the NHS in England. \nHe chose to pay for treatment with the drug at \u00a3250 a month. He told us then that he felt \"very fortunate\" to be able to afford it, but outraged for others who could not. \nAt the time, NHS England said it was reviewing the drug's use for a wider range of men. \nHowever, in December 2024 it told Prostate Cancer UK that \"it has not been possible to identify the necessary recurrent headroom in revenue budgets\". \nBecause abiraterone is a generic drug which has gone \"off patent\" and is licensed for only one group of prostate cancer patients, there is a complicated process to get it approved for wider use.\nEach year, NHS England can make \"discretionary\" investment decisions with a specialist advisory group, but it has chosen not to for this drug. \nSmyth's letter earlier this month said the process had to look at \"the overall budget impact of introducing a new treatment based on patient volumes\", and ministers would not intervene.\nMr Turner said he was \"stunned\" that nearly one-and-a-half years after the BBC report, NHS England had not caught up with NHS Scotland and NHS Wales. \nHe has spent \u00a320,000 so far on his treatment, and said he felt it was wrong that while expensive new patented drugs treatments could be funded, abiraterone - costing the NHS \u00a377 per pack per month - could not be.

Lose then move on.\nThe Football Association provoked debate, and some criticism, by ignoring the claims of English candidates such as Eddie Howe in their succession plan post-Southgate, to go for the best man available regardless of nationality.\nThe strategy was clear. The long-term can wait while a proven winner takes charge and Tuchel's first England squad merely confirms it.\nThere is a nod to the next generation with the inclusion of versatile defender Lewis-Skelly with England short at left-back and Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers, who is 22, but there was the definite whiff of short-term targets in Tuchel's selection.\nHowever, the recall of Henderson is the most eye-catching example of Tuchel wanting experience for the here and now. He last played for England in November 2023 and missed out on selection for last summer's Euro 2024.\nTuchel described Henderson as a \"serial winner\" and this is what the coach has in mind as he plots a path to next year's World Cup.\nJordan Henderson's England career looked over when he was left out of Gareth Southgate's Euro 2024 squad\nAnd then there is the shock selection of Burn. \nA wonderful story, as Newcastle United manager Howe agreed, but a very late stage for any player to prove they are international class.\nBurn would be the oldest player to win his first England cap since Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies made his debut against Montenegro on 12 October 2010 at 33 years and 200 days. The bustling forward was the oldest since 38-year-old Leslie Compton in 1950.\nIt is very much a case of going back to the past for the short-term future. Former interim boss Lee Carsley's last squad contained a total 627 caps, while this one has a tally of 664.\nTuchel is missing younger players who have been injured recently, such as Manchester United teenager Kobbie Mainoo and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, but is clear the German's reign is not going to be a slow burner.\nThe selection of Henderson and the return of Rashford demonstrates that Tuchel is prepared to start with a clean slate.\nHenderson's call-up came out of the blue after it looked like his England career was over when he, like Rashford, was left out of Gareth Southgate's squad for Euro 2024.\nThe former Liverpool captain had an ill-fated stint in Saudi Arabia before returning to Europe with Ajax, where Tuchel has clearly seen enough to recall him.\nTuchel appears to want Henderson as much for his influence off the pitch, saying: \"What he brings every time is leadership, character, personality and energy. He makes sure everyone lives by the standards and with character. He embodies everything we are trying to build.\"\nMarcus Rashford (right) is enjoying a revival in form and fortune on loan at Aston Villa\nEngland's head coach has long been a fan of Rashford and wants to be the beneficiary of Aston Villa manager Unai Emery's repair job on the forward's career.\nHe said: \"I had a strong feeling we should nominate him, to push him to stay at the level he is at now not fall back into old routines.\"\nTuchel's words offer an indication that he realises Rashford had fallen by the wayside at Old Trafford but is also convinced the 27-year-old can offer much to his new England.\nHe clearly does not feel the same about Manchester City's Jack Grealish. He would have been hoping to make a comeback after also missing out on Euro 2024, although he has not figured regularly under manager Pep Guardiola.\nTottenham midfielder James Maddison is another who is, for now at least, consigned to the margins,\nTuchel goes with that he knows by recalling Chelsea's Reece James as he makes his return from another hamstring injury. \nHe was a key member of Tuchel's side that won the Champions League in 2021 and there is a potential opening at right-back with Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold injured, Kyle Walker, 34, and on loan at AC Milan, and with Newcastle United's Tino Livramento talented but inexperienced.\nTuchel has made no secret of his desire to utilise the natural physical aspects of the English style into his squad and this is in evidence with this selection.\nBurn, ay 6 feet 7 inches, fits the bill, while Rogers combines raw power with natural skill and strong running. James also combines physical strength with great ability -and the squad has a very powerful look.\nTuchel was asked whether that lack of physicality cost England in previous tournaments.\nHe said: \"I don't think a lot is missing. Obviously a little bit is because we lost consecutive Euros finals and World Cup semi-final and quarter-finals. \n\"The feeling is a little step is needed to bring it over the line.\"\nTuchel's squad is sure to cause debate, especially in Nottingham, where Forest fans will feel Morgan Gibbs-White could have offered an \"X Factor\" after his outstanding performances in their tilt to reach the Champions League.\nThey will also offer up Callum Hudson-Odoi as an example of someone who deserves a return to the England squad after his rejuvenation, exemplified by his winning goal against Manchester City that puts Forest in such a wonderful position to reach the top four.\nEverton defender Jarrad Branthwaite, who won a full cap under Southgate, also misses out despite being in outstanding form since manager David Moyes returned to Goodison Park. He is included in Carsley's England Under-21 side.\nTottenham defender Djed Spence will have had his backers, while there is no place for Conor Gallagher despite his fine form at Atletico Madrid.\nTuchel resisted the temptation to include Arsenal 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, who also goes into Carsley's squad.\nThomas Tuchel gave a hugely impressive performance in front of the media after announcing his first squad.\nFrom suggestion he is intent on \"building a brotherhood\" in his England squad to talking about \"a parental vibe\" when handling Arsenal teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tuchel was confident and comfortable in his new skin as England head coach.\nNo subject was off limits, apart from when he declined to reveal who his captain might be if Harry Kane was not available.\nTuchel was open, honest and clearly excited about the task ahead, although he admitted he was \"missing the smell of the grass\" and could not wait to get on the training ground with his new charges.\nThis is a coach who has been around the block with big clubs such as Borussia Dortmund, Paris St. Germain and Bayern Munich, while getting a feel and admiration for the English game and his players at Chelsea.\nHe is the quick winner the FA wanted with his appointment.\nNow the serious work starts with the World Cup his goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRashford returns as Tuchel names first England squad",

        "article_text": "Netflix's latest big-budget film The Electric State, starring Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, is one of the most expensive movies ever made, and had some of the most scathing reviews in recent memory. But that doesn't mean it will flop.\nFilm critics haven't minced their words when delivering their verdicts on The Electric State.\nIt is \"a turgid eyesore\" and \"top-dollar tedium\", according to the Times. It's \"slick but dismally soulless\", declared the Hollywood Reporter, while the New York Times called it  \"obvious, garish and just plain dumb\".\nPaste pointed out its eye-watering budget, billing it as \"the most banal way you can spend $320m\". Warming to the theme, the magazine summed it up as \"one hell of an artistically neutered, sanitized boondoggle\".\nThere have been some kinder reviews. Empire said it was \"breezily watchable\" and worth three stars, while the Telegraph awarded four stars to the \"Spielbergian treat\".\nBut overall, its 15% Rotten Tomatoes score is a meagre return for any major film, especially one costing such a lot. The $320m (\u00a3247m) figure has been widely reported but neither confirmed nor denied by Netflix.

The Hollywood Reporter described Atlas as \"another Netflix movie made to half-watch while doing laundry\" - summing up this new genre.\nIn December, N+1 magazine quoted several screenwriters as saying a common request from Netflix executives is for characters to announce what they're doing \"so that viewers who have this programme on in the background can follow along\".\n\"Electric State does feel like that,\" Sandwell continues, \"where there are just random big dumps of the characters explaining exactly what's happened, sometimes something we've seen recently, just in case you're not following along.\n\"But it does depend on the movie.\"\nNetflix does have serious and critically-acclaimed movies, too, of course, but they are often not such crowd-pleasers. Emilia Perez, which led this year's Oscar nominations, has not troubled the Netflix global top 10 charts.\nAnother critic, Gav Squires, says many of Netflix's films are \"very average\", but don't usually have such astronomical budgets as The Electric State.\n\"Netflix know what they're doing,\" he says. \"They know that people are probably watching on a second screen, they're not paying full attention. So when they're putting stuff out that costs $30m that people aren't really watching and is kind of average, I'm not too fussed about it.\n\"But when they're spending $320m on a movie, I start getting really angry. $320m would have paid the budgets for the last, I think, 10 best picture Oscar winners.\n\"And it just feels like really, really bad value for money at that point.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nFrance thrash Scotland to become Six Nations champions\nThere was a sense of painful familiarity about Scotland's closing Six Nations performance in Paris, as they fell to a 35-16 defeat by champions France for their third loss of the tournament.\nThey were so dangerous and so competitive for long spells, but a failure to turn pressure into points, coupled with a ropey third quarter against France's monstrous forward replacements, cost them dear.\nThey trailed by three points on 42 minutes but the deficit was 19 come full-time as a fourth-place finish was confirmed.\nConsistently inconsistent has been a theme, with promising spells not converted into a complete 80-minute displays - and not for the first time.\nShould Scotland be delivering more? Or are mid-table finishes about right given what's at their disposal?\nTownsend optimistic on future but is it 'time for change'?\n'Scotland bum cheek away from converting' in Paris\nReaction, analysis & have your say\nDecisions went against Scotland throughout the championship. Pundits were taken aback when France hooker Peato Mauvaka's headbutt on Ben White was only punished with a yellow card while the hosts were 10-0 ahead in Paris.\nBut ultimately, the Scots didn't capitalise against Ireland, England and France when the matches were in the balance and went on to suffer three defeats.\nWhen asked if Scotland deserved to finish higher than fourth, head coach Gregor Townsend was clear.\n\"No, if we don't win when we have a lot of the game, that's where we are going to finish,\" he said.\n\"It is a very tough competition. Teams can't play well every game; no-one won a Grand Slam. We are a quality side, it just didn't go our way this year.\"\nThis video can not be played\nScotland 'can match world's best packs' - Townsend\nFrance are the benchmark just now. A thriving domestic league, a thriving youth setup, and a thriving grassroots scene. It's night and day from the situation in Scotland. \n\"Look at our player participation numbers,\" said former Scotland forward Johnnie Beattie. \"France have hundreds of thousands and we have around 20,000 adults.\n\"That is not something Scottish fans will want to hear but when you look at numbers, that is where we are.\"\nWe can quibble over the precise numbers, perhaps, but the thrust of Beattie's argument is unimpeachable. \nNo more was the difference in depth exposed than after 46 minutes of play in Paris, when France head coach Fabien Galthie turned to his bench.\nJulien Marchand, Cyril Baille, Dorian Aldegheri, Emmanuel Meafou, Oscar Jegou and Anthony Jelonch were all sent on to turn the tide the home side's way. \nWorld-class back-rower and France captain Gregory Alldritt was removed from the fray, because he can be. It worked a treat. \nIn contrast, Townsend left replacement prop Will Hurd on the bench and asked Zander Fagerson to play the full 80 minutes. \nOf those who were introduced, Ewan Ashman is plagued by line-out throwing issues; Ewan Johnson plies his trade in France's second tier with Oyonnax; and Marshall Sykes is not a guaranteed starter for struggling Edinburgh. \nThe Scottish replacements left everything out on the pitch when they came on, but they are being asked to compete with a different level of player.\nIt was a similar tale in the defeat by Ireland. Scotland were outthought and outmuscled at Murrayfield.\nFormer Irish fly-half Ronan O'Gara said \"it felt like a 40-point win\" for Ireland that day, and he wasn't exaggerating.\nWhen push comes to shove, Scotland are a level below the northern hemisphere's elite sides.\nBecause of that lack of depth, Scotland are forced to play in a manner that isn't conducive to grinding out Test match win after Test match win. \nTheir gameplan in Paris was clear. Keep the ball alive, take risks, play with pace and width and get their talented backline involved as much as possible.\n\"We played with some fantastic endeavour and were quite sharp on the ball, but we couldn't break through, get in behind and really stress them,\" former Scotland full-back Chris Paterson said.\n\"Scotland played the right way, gave ourselves the best opportunity by keeping the ball alive, playing as quick as possible. It wasn't always accurate but it's the right way to go about it.\"\nFormer Scotland prop Peter Wright echoed those thoughts: \"I was pretty proud of the way Scotland played. They stuck at it, went out and tried to play the game that could have beaten France.\n\"They had a go, moved the ball, played with width. [Blair] Kinghorn had one of his best games. [Duhan] van der Merwe and [Darcy] Graham looked dangerous.\"\n\"[Finn] Russell will get a lot of criticism for certain things, but I thought he played pretty well and gave Scotland a chance. He varied the game enough to try and hurt the French.\"\nTownsend's side were not fixated on playing the percentages and relying on a solid set-piece, because this Scotland team cannot do that.\nThey have magnificent moments in games, plays that take your breath away, but because of the high-risk strategy they rarely deliver for the duration of a match, let alone for multiple matches across a championship.\nTheir first-half performance was excellent at Stade de France, but they were brushed aside as legs grew tired and mistakes were punished.\nTownsend's side have beaten Italy and the worst Welsh team for a generation in this tournament. That is it.\nPerhaps Wright summed it up best. \n\"Ultimately, France are a better side,\" he said. \"There are world-class players all over the pitch, they can bring real quality off the bench and that just adds to the tempo and physicality.\"\n'Scotland put lot into it, but France just better'\n15/03/25",

        "article_text": "Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic \u2013 and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\nWhen Tadas Eidukevi\u010dius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "In Japan, a smelly waste product is being reimagined as a potential clean fuel of the future that is powering cars and tractors.\nWe're being eyed suspiciously by dozens of cows. Their breath fogs cartoonishly from their nostrils.\nIt's a brisk morning in snowy Hokkaido, an island in the north of Japan. The cold air carries the distinct scent of cow manure \u2013 a smelly yet familiar side-effect of the region's thriving dairy industry. Accounting for 20% of the country's landmass, this island is the second-largest in Japan. It's also home to over a million cows, which produce over half of the country's milk and dairy products.\nWe are visiting one farm in Hokkaido that wants to transform the source of the pungent aroma in the air into something valuable. They are turning cattle manure into hydrogen.\u00a0\nWhen it is burned, hydrogen does not emit carbon, making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. There are widespread hopes it could be used as a sustainable fuel to heat homes and power cars, trains, aircraft and ships in the future.\nBut the most common way of producing hydrogen today involves using methane \u2013 a fossil fuel piped up from deep underground, meaning it is still associated with significant carbon emissions. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting water using electricity, but this can be expensive and is only low carbon if renewable sources of electricity are used.\nThe Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm, however, is using a different source \u2013 a waste product that there is no shortage of on Hokkaido. Around 20 million tonnes of cow manure is generated in Hokkaido annually. If not treated correctly, it can be an environmental burden, producing significant methane emissions as well as affecting water quality if allowed to leak into streams and rivers. So can it instead be used as a source of sustainable energy?\n\"This project to produce hydrogen from livestock manure originated in Japan and is unique to this place,\" says Maiko Abe from Air Water, one of several companies involved in the hydrogen farm project. We are visiting the facility in Shikaoi, a town in central Hokkaido, to film an upcoming episode of the BBC's TechXplore focusing on Japan. \"Shikaoi accounts for 30% of Hokkaido\u2019s cow waste and urine, so it has great potential for renewable energy.\"\nLaunched in 2015 by Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, the project aims to convert agricultural by-products into hydrogen to supply the local, rural community in a circular economy.\u00a0The cow excrement and urine is collected from local dairy farms before being fed into a anaerobic digester at a central facility. Here bacteria break down the organic waste to produce biogas and a liquid fertiliser. The biogas is then purified into methane that is used to manufacture hydrogen.\nThe plant now has a hydrogen production capacity of 70 cubic metres (18,500 gallons), with an onsite fuelling station that can fill around 28 vehicles fitted with hydrogen fuel cells per day, says Abe. Although the fuel can be used by cars with fuel cells, the plant's fuelling station has been specially designed to accommodate agricultural vehicles such as tractors and forklift trucks. These farm vehicles are difficult to electrify with batteries due to their size and the type of work they do. The hydrogen-powered vehicles are used around the farms' sites, reducing the emissions that would otherwise be created by using other fuel sources.\u00a0\nCattle-made-hydrogen is also stored in canisters that are transported to provide power and heat to other facilities in the area, including a local sturgeon fish farm and the nearby Obihiro Zoo.\nBut hydrogen isn't without its problems. It needs to be stored in high-pressure tanks as a gas, and can be prone to leakage due to its low molecular weight. It can also degrade metal storage containers, leaving them embrittled, and is easily ignited and so requires additional safety precautions when handling it.\nHydrogen can also be stored as a liquid by chilling it to cryogenic temperatures of below \u2013253C (-423F), but this can be energy intensive and requires large amounts of additional infrastructure.\nHydrogen has nearly three times the energy content of petrol (gasoline) when taken by mass alone. But its low molecular weight also means that by volume, the energy packed into a litre of liquid hydrogen is a quarter that of petrol. Put simply, as the lightest gas in the Universe, hydrogen takes up more space kilogram for kilogram than petrol. This means a lot more storage space is needed for hydrogen compared to fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and natural gas. It also means producing and storing it at scale can require large amounts of energy and infrastructure.\nBut as well as these hurdles, the hydrogen farm project in Hokkaido also faces other challenges specific to northern Japan's climate.\nHokkaido's subzero winters means new technologies are needed to produce the hydrogen stably without the small amounts of water vapour in the methane freezing.\nUsing agricultural waste as a methane source to produce hydrogen is relatively uncommon, but it ultimately uses\u00a0the same process as is used to produce hydrogen from natural gas: steam reforming. Here, steam heated to 800C (1,472F) reacts with the methane to produce hydrogen, along with the byproducts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO2).\u00a0\nIn the case of cow manure, however, says Abe, the project remains sustainable as this carbon originated in the grass the cows grazed on: \"Since it was originally in the atmosphere, it is considered carbon neutral.\"\nIn addition, it helps to prevent the methane that would otherwise have been emitted from the manure from getting into the atmosphere, where it is a potent greenhouse gas.\nLeftover slurry from the manure after the biogas has been extracted is sprayed as fertiliser onto nearby fields, while formic acid \u2013 which is both used in and created by the processes \u2013 could be offered as a preservative for cattle feed, says Abe.\u00a0\nCurrently, the electricity needed to produce and store the hydrogen comes from the national grid. But Abe says there's potential to shift to green energy, given Hokkaido\u2019s promising sea, wind and geothermal potential, thus reducing the carbon emissions of this electricity.\nStill, other challenges remain. The high cost of the hydrogen compared to fossil fuels and low demand mean expanding the operation is difficult.\u00a0\n\"The construction costs of hydrogen stations are very high,\" says Abe. \"Since hydrogen vehicles are not yet widespread, we're keeping our filling capacity low to manage initial investment. As adoption increases, we'll expand supply.\"\nTo encourage hydrogen vehicle adoption in the area, hydrogen prices are subsidised by the plant, matching the cost of petrol. Hydrogen refuelling stations are also being developed in major Hokkaido cities like Sapporo and Muroran.\nHype Meter\nThe process to make clean hydrogen fuel from cow manure in Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm is worth paying attention to, especially as it also reduces methane which would otherwise be released from the manure. With other countries exploring how to use other types of waste, from pig dung to coconut husks, to produce hydrogen using similar processes, it appears this could be a model adaptable to other local contexts.\nWith the scale still small, however, and costs of production high, it remains to be seen how widespread this industry can be. There are also other ways of producing fuel from cow waste, such as simply using the biogas produced from manure as a fuel itself without needing to convert it to hydrogen.\u00a0\nJapan is the world leader in hydrogen vehicles and has invested considerably in developing the technology. But for now battery-powered electric vehicles remain cheaper than hydrogen powered ones.\nThough it's unlikely that cow manure alone will ever meet Japan's hydrogen demand, it could contribute significantly, and Shikaoi is creating a model for a circular economy that it hopes will show how costs can fall with the economies of scale.\u00a0\nAnd there is growing interest in other parts of the world in using waste materials to produce hydrogen, with pig dung, poultry waste and even coconut husks having been explored as potential feedstocks. In Thailand, vehicle manufacturer Toyota is even exploring the use of hydrogen made from chicken waste to fuel its vehicles.\nMeanwhile, engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago in the US recently developed another promising method to make hydrogen involving manure. In their case, they used the manure, along with sugarcane waste and corn husks, to make biochar, a carbon-rich substance which vastly reduces the amount of electricity needed to convert water to hydrogen.\n\"We are the first group to show that you can produce hydrogen utilising biomass at a fraction of a volt,\" says Meenesh Singh, a chemical engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago who led the project.\nIn the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, on Kyushu, meanwhile, another waste product is being used to produce hydrogen \u2013 and here the dung is from humans.\nFor more than a decade, hydrogen has been created at the city's sewage treatment plant for use in hydrogen-powered vehicles. Most recently it has been used to fuel a fleet of zero-emission rubbish trucks.\nAkira Miyaoka, hydrogen utilisation manager for Fukuoka City, says trucks that transport daily products are the town's main source of CO2, rather than large factories as in many other cities. \"So we are working to reduce CO2 emissions from commercial trucks,\" she says.\nThe initiative started as a collaboration between Kyushu University and Fukuoka City, but now involves several major companies including Toyota.\n\"Sewage is something that is steadily discharged every day in the daily lives of citizens, so by making effective use of that sewage and extracting hydrogen as energy, we can achieve local production and local consumption of energy,\" says Miyaoka.\u00a0\nGenerating hydrogen from human waste starts with water from various household sources \u2013 including showers, dishwashers and toilets \u2013 arriving at the treatment plant. As the water is cleaned, the residual sludge is kept as a source of biogas and converted into hydrogen.\u00a0\n\"Sewage and biogas contain various impurities, so the process begins with the process of removing those impurities, which I think is a little different from other hydrogen production processes,\" says Miyaoka.\nIn 2024, Toyota helped the city launch Japan\u2019s first hydrogen-powered service vehicle fleet, including ambulances, delivery vans and bin trucks. Officials at the sewage treatment plant say it is capable of producing 300kg (661lbs) of hydrogen in 12 hours \u2013 enough to fuel 30 trucks.\u00a0\nThe rubbish trucks head out six nights each week, each collecting 1.7 tonnes (3,700lb) of rubbish, all while running silently and emission-free on the bodily waste of the people they are collecting other waste from.\nFukuoka's sewage-to-hydrogen fuelling station has been around since 2015, and several other countries around the world are now adopting a similar approach.\nConcord Blue has developed waste-to-energy plants in Germany, India, Japan and the US, converting waste and biomass into hydrogen and bioenergy. Several water authorities in the UK are also working on projects to derive hydrogen from sewage.\nA prototype race car has also been developed using sewage-derived hydrogen in the UK. The Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), in partnership with Severn Trent Water, is harnessing microbes that generate hydrogen fuel from waste. They anticipate the technology could hit the mainstream within five years, despite existing challenges. (Read about how sewage-powered cars could be the future of motorsport.)\nOn a larger scale, aviation accounts for 2% of global carbon emissions, and researchers in a UK lab have developed jet fuel made entirely from human sewage.\nStill, despite the promise, all of these technologies have yet to be delivered at significant scale.\nWhether in rural or city landscapes, the Japanese projects we've seen during in filming are inspiring because they have the local community at their heart.\nWhile adoption of hydrogen cars has stalled, hydrogen truck adoption is increasing gradually and it is these larger heavier industrial vehicles that contribute most significantly per vehicle to greenhouse gas emissions.\nBy reimagining waste as a resource, these projects demonstrate that energy can be found in even the most unlikely of places.\n* Paul Carter is the presenter of TechXplore.

        "article_text": "After Kim Visintine put her son to bed every night at a hospital in St Louis, Missouri, she spent her evening in the hospital\u2019s library. She was determined to know how her boy had become seriously ill with a rare brain tumour at just a week old.\n\"Doctors were shocked,\" she says. \"We were told that his illness was one in a million. Other parents were learning to change diapers but I was learning how to change chemotherapy ports and IVs.\"\nKim\u2019s son Zack was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme. It is a brain tumour that is very rare in children and is usually seen in adults over 45. \nZack had chemotherapy treatments but doctors said there was no hope of him ever recovering. He died at just six years old.\nYears later, social media and community chatter made Kim start to think that her son was not an isolated case. Perhaps he was part of a bigger picture growing in their community surrounding Coldwater Creek.\nIn this part of the US, cancer fears have prompted locals to accuse officials of not doing enough to support those who may have been exposed to radiation due to the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940s. \nA compensation programme that was designed to pay out to some Americans who contracted diseases after exposure to radiation expired last year - before it could be extended to the St Louis area. \nThis Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Reca) provided one-time payouts to people who may have developed cancer or other diseases while living in areas where activities such as atomic weapons testing took place. It paid out $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) to more than 41,000 claimants before coming to an end in 2024.\nBenefits were paid to such neighbours, frequently called \"downwinders\", in Arizona, Utah and Nevada, but not New Mexico, where the world's first test of a nuclear weapon took place in 1945. Research published in 2020 by the National Cancer Institute suggested that hundreds of cancers in the area would not have occurred without radiation exposure.\nSt Louis, meanwhile, was where uranium was refined and used to help create the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project. After World War Two ended, the chemical was dumped near the creek and left uncovered, allowing waste to seep into the area.\nDecades later, federal investigators acknowledged an increased cancer risk for some people who played in the creek as children, but added in their report: \"The predicted increases in the number of cancer cases from exposures are small, and no method exists to link a particular cancer with this exposure.\"\nThe clean-up of the creek is still ongoing and is not expected to finish until 2038.\nA new bill has been put forward in the House, and Josh Hawley, a US senator representing Missouri, says he has raised the issue with President Donald Trump. \nWhen Kim flicks through her school yearbook, she can identify those who have become sick and those who have since passed away. The numbers are startling.\n\"My husband didn\u2019t grow up in this area, and he said to me, 'Kim, this is not normal. It seems like we\u2019re always talking about one of your friends passing away or going to a funeral',\" she says.\nJust streets away from the creek, Karen Nickel grew up spending her days near the water picking berries, or in the nearby park playing baseball. Her brother would often try and catch fish in Coldwater Creek.\n\"I always tell people that we had just the fairytale childhood that you would expect in what you consider suburban America,\" says Karen. \"Big backyards, big families, children playing out together until the street lights came on at night.\"\nBut years later, her carefree childhood now looks very different.\n\"Fifteen people from the street I grew up on have died from rare cancers,\" she says. \"We have neighbourhoods here where every house has been affected by some cancer or some illness. We have streets where you can\u2019t just find a house where a family has not been affected by this.\"\nWhen Karen\u2019s sister was just 11 years old, doctors discovered that her ovaries were covered in cysts. The same had happened to their neighbour when she was just nine. Karen\u2019s six-year-old granddaughter was born with a mass on her right ovary.\nKaren helped found Just Moms STL, a group that is dedicated to protecting the community from future exposures that could be linked to cancers - and which advocates for a clean-up of the area.\n\"We get messages every day from people that are suffering from illnesses and are questioning whether this is from exposure,\" she says. \"These are very aggressive illnesses that the community is getting, from cancers all the way to autoimmune diseases.\"\nTeresa Rumfelt grew up just a street away from Karen and lived in her family home from 1979 until 2010. She remembers every one of her animals passing away from cancer and her neighbours getting ill from rare diseases.\nYears later, her sister Via Von Banks was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a form of motor neurone disease. Some medical studies have suggested there could be a link between radiation and ALS, but this is not definitive - and more research needs to be done to firm it up. \nThat does not reassure people like Teresa who are concerned that more needs to be done to understand how locals are being affected. \n\"ALS took my sister at 50,\" Teresa says. \"I think it was the worst disease ever of mankind. When she was diagnosed in 2019, she\u2019d just got her career going and her children were growing. She stayed positive through all of it.\"\nLike Hawley, Just STL Moms and other community members want the government's compensation act to be expanded to include people within the St Louis area, despite the programme being in limbo after expiring.\nExpanding it to the Coldwater Creek community would mean that locals could be offered compensation if they could prove they were harmed as a result of the Manhattan Project, during which the atomic bomb was developed with the help of uranium-processing in St Louis. It would also allow screenings and further study into illnesses other than cancer. \nIn a statement to the BBC, the US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it took concerns very seriously and had actively worked with federal, state and local partners - as well as community members - to understand their health concerns, and to ensure community members were not exposed to the Manhattan Project-era waste.\nThe BBC has also contacted the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is leading the clean-up - but has not received a response to a request for comment.\n\"My sister would have loved to be part of the fight. She\u2019d be the first to picket,\" says Teresa of her efforts to get greater support from the government.\nThe trend in people around Coldwater Creek getting unwell has not gone unnoticed among healthcare professionals.\nDr Gautum Agarwal, a cancer surgeon at Mercy Hospital in St Louis, says he has not noticed a \"statistical thing\", but notes that he has seen husbands and wives and their neighbours presenting cancers.\nNow, he ensures that his patients are asked where they live and how close they are to Coldwater Creek.\n\"I tell them that there\u2019s a potential that there\u2019s a link. And if your neighbours or family live near there, we should get them screened more often. And maybe you should get your kids screened earlier.\"\nHe hopes that over time more knowledge will be gained about the issue, and for a study into multi-cancer early detection tests to be introduced that could help catch any potential cancers, and help reassure people in the area.\nOther experts take a different view of the risks. \"There is a narrative that many people are sick from cancers, specifically from exposures while living next to Coldwater Creek for the last few decades\", says Roger Lewis, a professor in the environmental and occupations health department of St Louis University. \n\"But the data and studies don't indicate that. They show that there is some risk but it's small. It doesn't mean that it's not significant in some ways, but it's very limited.\" \nProf Lewis acknowledges the fear in the community, saying locals will feel safer if the government is clearer about its efforts  to eliminate any hazards. \nFor many people near Coldwater Creek, conversation with authorities is not easing the angst that comes with living in an area known for the dumping of nuclear waste.\n\"It\u2019s almost a given in our community that at some point we all expect to have some sort of cancer or illness,\u201d says Kim Visintine. \u201cThere\u2019s almost this apathy within our group that, well, it\u2019s just a matter of time.\"\nCorrection 16 March: This article originally reported that the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act covered parts of New Mexico. It has been amended to show that benefits were paid under the act to people in Arizona, Nevada and Utah, but not in New Mexico.",

        "article_text": "The White House has denied an accusation from rights groups that it flouted due process by defying a judge's order while carrying out deportations at the weekend.\nA group of 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members, plus 23 alleged members of the international MS-13 gang, were sent from the US to a prison in El Salvador. Some were removed from the country under a law not invoked since World War Two.\nThe move came despite a temporary block issued by a judge. The White House said the judge's order itself was not lawful and was issued after the group was deported.\nNeither the US government nor El Salvador has identified the detainees, or provided details of their alleged criminality or gang membership.\nAnnouncing the move on Saturday, the day after he signed it, Trump accused the gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\".\nHe cited the Alien Enemies Act - a piece of legislation that dates to 1798, which was designed to allow non-citizens to be deported in times of war or invasion. Campaigners have questioned Trump's justification.\nThe act was used to process 137 of the total of 261 people who were deported, the White House said on Monday. \nThe basis on which the other deportees were removed from the US remains unclear, and details of the group as a whole have not been disclosed.\nSeveral relatives of men believed to be among the group told the New York Times that their loved ones did not have gang ties. \nThe White House, for its part, has insisted that authorities are \"sure\" that the detainees were gang members, based on intelligence. \nThe case raises constitutional questions since, under the US system of checks and balances, government agencies are expected to comply with a federal judge's ruling.\nA hearing to ascertain more information about the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act is taking place on Monday afternoon. \nThe order to halt the deportations came from US District Judge James Boasberg on Saturday evening, who demanded a 14-day pause pending further legal arguments.\nAfter lawyers told him that planes with deportees had already taken off, the judge reportedly gave a verbal order for the flights to turn back, although that directive did not form part of his written ruling.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied the court ruling had been broken. \n\"The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" she said. \"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from US territory.\"\nThe justice department echoed Leavitt, saying the deportees had already left before the judge's ruling - which it has appealed against.\nBut a timeline of events reported by US media suggests the Trump administration appears to have had the opportunity to stop at least some of the deportations.\nTrump's border tsar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House on Monday that Trump did \"exactly the right thing\". \n\"The plane was already over international waters with a plane full of terrorists and significant public safety threats,\" he said. \"We removed terrorists. That should be celebrated in this country.\" \nEl Salvador's President Nayib Bukele confirmed the arrival of deportees. \"Oopsie... Too late,\" he said of the judge's order, writing on social media. His team also published footage of some of the men inside one of its mega-jails.\nAccording to the White House, El Salvador's government received $6m (\u00a34.62m) to take the detainees, which Leavitt said \"is pennies on the dollar\" compared to the cost of confining them in US prisons. \nRights groups accused Trump of using a 227-year-old law to circumvent due process.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) questioned Trump's use of a sweeping wartime authority which allows fast-track deportations. \"I think we're in very dangerous territory here in the United States with the invocation of this law,\" said Lee Gelernt from the organisation.\nThe Alien Enemies Act only allowed deportations when the US was in a declared war with that foreign government, or was being invaded, Mr Gelernt said. \"A gang is not invading,\" he told BBC News. \nThe act was last used during World War Two to intern Japanese-American civilians.\nMaking matters worse was the fact \"the administration is saying nobody can review what they're doing\", Mr Gelernt added.\nMeanwhile, Amnesty International USA said the deportations were \"yet another example of the Trump administration's racist targeting\" of Venezuelans \"based on sweeping claims of gang affiliation\".\nVenezuela itself criticised Trump, saying he \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\".\nThe latest deportations under Trump's second term are part of the president's long-running campaign against illegal immigration.  \nThe US president has also moved to strengthen ties with El Salvador.\nThe two gangs targeted with the weekend deportations were declared \"foreign terrorist organisations\" by Trump after returning to the White House in January.",

        "article_text": "The record for a single trip into space currently stands at 437 days, but prolonged periods in orbit can alter an astronaut's body in some surprising ways, changing their muscles, brains and even their gut bacteria.\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore never intended to stay for nine months. Their initial trip to the International Space Station onboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was scheduled to be just eight days in June 2024. But after technical problems with the spacecraft meant it had to return to Earth without them, their stay in space has been longer than expected.\u00a0\nOf course, neither are new to the rigours of space travel. They are both experienced astronauts. But any extended time in the strange, low gravity environment of space is likely to have affected their bodies. To understand how, we need to look at those who have stayed for longer.\u00a0\nThe longest single spaceflight by an American to date was by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio after he spent 371 days\u00a0living aboard the\u00a0American-football-field-sized collection of modules and solar panels that make up the ISS.\nHis time in orbit \u2013 which surpassed the previous US record of 355 consecutive days \u2013 was extended in March 2023 after the spacecraft he and his crewmates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak. He eventually came home in October 2023. The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km).\nEven so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human \u2013 Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s.\nAnd in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts \u2013 Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub \u2013 broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. The pair departed the ISS in the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft along with US astronaut Tracy Dyson, who had spent six months onboard. With a huge grin on his face, Kononenko gave a double thumbs up as he was helped from the re-entry capsule after it bumped back to Earth in a cloud of dust near the remote town of Dzhezkazgan on the Kazakhstan Steppe. He now also holds the record for the longest cumulative time in space \u2013 a total of 1,111 days in orbit.\nKononenko and Chub travelled more than 158 million miles during their 5,984 orbits of the Earth in the latest mission to the ISS. But spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies, so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams.\nRubio's own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long-duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present. He is the first astronaut to participate in\u00a0a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body.\nWhile the results have yet to be published, it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to explore deeper into the Solar System. A return journey to Mars, for example, is\u00a0expected to take around 1,100 days\u00a0(just over three years) under current plans. The spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS, meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed.\nBut problems keeping fit aside, just what does spaceflight do to the human body?\nMuscles and bones\nWithout the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those\u00a0muscles that help to maintain our posture\u00a0in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps \u2013 in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks\u00a0muscle mass can fall by as much as 20%\u00a0and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%.\nSimilarly, because astronauts are not putting their skeletons through as much mechanical strain as they do when subject to Earth's gravity, their bones also start to demineralise and lose strength. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of their bone mass every month they spend in space and up to 10% over a six-month period (on Earth, older men and women lose bone mass at a rate of 0.5%-1% every year). This can increase their risk of suffering fractures and increase the amount of time it takes to heal. It can take up to four years for their bone mass to return to normal after returning to Earth.\nTo combat this, astronauts undertake 2.5 hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS. This includes a series of squats, deadlifts, rows and bench presses using a resistive exercise device installed in the ISS's \"gym\", alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike. They also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible.\nA recent study, however, highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size. It recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss.\nThe lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly. This can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on Earth. During a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to Earth, Rubio himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening.\n\"I think my spine has extended just enough that I'm kind of wedged into my seat liner, so I shouldn't move much at all,\" he said.\nWeight loss\nAlthough weight means very little while in orbit \u2013 the microgravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely, including human bodies \u2013 maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit. Although Nasa tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods, including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station, it can still affect an astronaut's body. Scott Kelly, a Nasa astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long-term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for 340 days while his twin brother stayed back on Earth, lost 7% of his body mass while in orbit.\nEyesight\nOn Earth, gravity helps to force the blood in our bodies downward while the heart pumps it up again. In space, however, this process becomes messed up (although the body does adapt somewhat), and blood can accumulate in the head more than it normally would. Some of this fluid can pool at the back of the eye and around the optic nerve, leading to oedema. This can lead to changes in vision such as decreased sharpness and structural changes in the eye itself. These changes can start to occur after just two weeks in space but as that time goes on, the risk increases. Some of the vision changes reverse within about a year of astronauts returning to Earth, but others can be permanent.\nExposure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems. The Earth's atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS, this protection disappears. While spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation, astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves.\nNeural shuffling\nAfter his long stay on the ISS, however, Kelly's cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother's on the ground. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home.\nA study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit. It found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function \u2013 in other words, movement \u2013 and also in the vestibular cortex, which plays an important role in orientation, balance and perception of our own motion. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down.\nA more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. Cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles (responsible for storing cerebrospinal fluid, providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste) can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size.\nFriendly bacteria\nIt is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorgansims that live in and on our bodies. This microbiota can influence how we digest food, affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work.\nResearchers examining Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the very different food he was eating and the change in the people he spent his days with (we obtain a horrifying amount of gut and oral microorganisms from the people we live alongside). But exposure to radiation and the use of recycled water, along with changes to his physical activity could all also have played a role. (Find out more about how exercise affects your gut microbes.)\nSkin\nAlthough there have now been five Nasa astronauts who have spent more than 300 days in orbit, we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit. His skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station. Researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint.\nGenes\n\nOne of the most significant findings from Kelly's prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA. At the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as telomeres, which are thought to help protect our genes from damage. As we age, these get shorter, but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these telomeres.\n\"Most striking, however, was the finding of significantly longer telomeres during spaceflight,\" says Susan Bailey, a professor of environmental and radiological health at Colorado State University who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother. She has done separate studies with another 10 unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months. \"Also unexpected was that telomere length shortened rapidly on return to Earth for all crewmembers. Of particular relevance to long-term health and ageing trajectories, astronauts in general had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they did before.\"\nExactly why this happens is still being unravelled, she says. \"We have some clues, but additional long-duration crewmembers \u2013 like Rubio, who spent one year in space \u2013 will be critical to really characterising and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes.\"\nOne possible cause could be exposure to the complex mix of radiation while in space. Astronauts who experience long-term exposure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage, she says.\nThere were also some changes in gene expression \u2013 the mechanism that reads the DNA to produce proteins in cells \u2013 seen in Kelly that may have been related to his journey into space. Some of these related to the body's response to DNA damage, bone formation and the immune system's response to stress. Most of these changes, however, had returned to normal within six months of his return to Earth.\nIn June 2024, a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight. Using gene expression data from samples obtained from the crew of the SpaceX Inspiration 4 mission, who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of 2021, it identified changes in 18 proteins related to the immune system, ageing and muscle growth.\nComparing their gene activity to those of 64 other astronauts on previous missions, the study found in the expression of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight. The men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight, with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to Earth.\nIn particular, the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin-6, which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body, and interleukin-8, which is produced to gulde immune cells to sites of infection, were more affected in the men compared to the women. Another protein, called firbrinogen, which is involved in blood clotting, was also affected more in male astronauts.\nBut the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight, but it could be related to their response to stress.\nYou can hear Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below. With an accumulated 675 days in space, she has spent more time in orbit than any other American, although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has clocked up 878 days in space.\nImmune system\n\nKelly received a series of vaccines before, during and after his trip into space and his immune system\u00a0was found to react normally. But Bailey's research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit.\nThere are still many questions to be answered, however, about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal, big-brained species that evolved to live on Earth. As researchers pour over Rubio's medical tests, blood samples and scans following his 371 days in space, they will doubtless be hoping they will learn more.\n* This article was originally published on 27 September 2023.

        "article_text": "As leaders around the world try to figure out how best to deal with the new Trump administration, one Canadian official has come out swinging.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, a regular on major US networks where he has addressed Americans directly, was among the first in Canada to pull US alcohol off the shelves as a trade war between the two neighbours ramped up.\nFord has also ripped up a multi-million dollar contract with Elon Musk's Starlink, and has been unafraid to use energy exports to the US as a bargaining chip - all in a bid to get Trump to withdraw his tariff threats against Canada.\nThe right-wing, plain-spoken politician admitted he was initially delighted Donald Trump won re-election and viewed him as an ally.\nBut then, Ford said, using an expletive, the US president pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\".\nThis week, it appeared that Ford's unusual tactics had grabbed Trump's attention.\nSpeaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Tuesday, the US president described Ford as a \"very strong man\" as he addressed Ontario's threat to slap a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity.\nFord has since shelved that plan pending further discussions with the Trump administration. But his threat to hike the price of electricity on Americans seems to have earned him a grudging nod of respect from Trump, who later backed off from doubling tariffs on aluminium and steel to 50%.\nIt also helped Ford score a meeting with US officials in Washington to discuss the future of the Canada-US trade relationship. \nFord sat on Thursday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The meeting was also attended by Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc.\nThe meeting was \"very, very productive\" though \"bumps in the road\" remain, he said afterwards. \nIt is unclear whether Ford's defiant stance will earn Canada more favours from Trump. It is also an approach that is not unanimously agreed on, with Premier Danielle Smith of the oil-rich Alberta vehemently refusing to withhold any of her province's energy exports to the US.\nTrump's recent willingness to turn down the heat, however, signals that Ford may be succeeding in grabbing the attention of the US, said Shakir Chambers, a Canadian Conservative strategist at the Toronto-based Oyster Group.\n\"That's how you deal with Trump, through a position of strength,\" Mr Chambers told the BBC. \"Ford understands the language of Trump's people and inner circle.\"\nIt at least earned him a rare compliment from the US president, who for several months has berated Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau repeatedly by calling him \"governor,\" while expressing his desire to absorb Canada and make it \"the 51st state\".\nAlso rare is seeing the Oval Office pay attention to the premier of a Canadian province, whose day-to-day is ordinarily preoccupied with domestic matters such as infrastructure projects, healthcare funding and co-operating with the federal government.\nBut these are no ordinary times in Canada. The country is in the middle of a transfer of power, from outgoing Trudeau to Prime Minister-designate Mark Carney.\nIt is also facing what has been referred to as an \"existential threat\" from its neighbour and long-time ally to the south.\nAnnouncing his intention to pause energy tariffs pending trade talks, Ford vowed to Canadians that he will not \"roll over\" and warned that using Ontario's energy supply as a bargaining chip remains on the table. \nBut he said he will not ignore the chance to resolve this dispute with Americans.\nHis emergence as the face of Canada's fight is, in many ways, understandable. As Ontario premier, he is at the helm of a province that is home to 16 million people and Canada's large auto manufacturing sector, which is deeply intertwined with that of the US, leaving it vulnerable to any broad tariff threats.\nHe is also chair of the Council of the Federation, a multilateral congress that includes all of Canada's provincial and territorial premiers.\nOn Wednesday, Ford kept busy ahead of his meeting with the Americans. He sat down for breakfast with incoming Prime Minister Carney, where the two discussed the need to \"stand firm and strong\" to Trump.\nAmericans will undoubtedly see more of Ford in the coming weeks and months. The premier just decisively secured four more years in office after campaigning on standing up against the US president.\nFor Ontarians, Ford is a well-known figure. He has led the province since 2018 and is only the second premier in its history to secure three consecutive majority government wins.\nHe is the product of a Toronto political dynasty known as \"Ford Nation\". For many years, he was overshadowed by his younger brother, the late Rob Ford, who was the mayor of Toronto from 2010 to 2014 before he was ousted after a crack cocaine scandal.\nLocally, the Fords are infamous for their \"authentic\" and approachable style of politics, said Mr Chambers, who was coached high school football by the younger Ford.\nPremier Ford is known for handing out his personal cell phone number to constituents, encouraging them to contact him directly. During a news conference on US tariffs last week, he urged people to be patient as he worked to respond to more than 4,000 text messages he has received lately.\nDespite his popularity, the premier is also embroiled in several controversies. Chief among them is an ongoing police investigation into a now-scrapped deal his government made that would have allowed the development of environmentally-protected land.\nOn the national stage, he has run up against Alberta Premier Smith, who has called for a more measured and cautious response to Trump and his tariffs. \nThat caution has also been practised by other leaders, namely France's Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, both of whom struck a more diplomatic tone in their February visits to the White House. \nBut Ford's defiant stance against Trump is widely supported in Canada. Polls show the majority of Canadians support retaliating against the US, and a swell of nationalism has since emerged across the country.\nWhile Ford has been forceful, he has also been careful in his direct appeals to Americans.\n\"Believe me when I say I don't want to do this,\" he said earlier this week when he announced his plan to hike electricity prices, before underscoring that his priority is to protect Ontario jobs.",

        "article_text": "Sleep can have a significant impact on athlete performance at the highest level\nGood sleep hygiene is a crucial competent of any top-level athlete's approach to fitness and wellbeing.\nPoor quality sleep can have a negative physical and mental impact, hindering an athlete's performance. But manage sleep well, and they can maximise their ability.\nFor World Sleep Day - 14 March - BBC Sport spoke to a sleep expert and international athlete to find out how elite sportspeople manage their sleep, and how you can improve yours.\nAccording to the NHS, adults require between seven and nine hours of sleep per night.\nGiven the changeable schedules athletes in elite sports are subject to, sticking to a strict sleep routine can be very difficult.\nThat means maintaining as much consistency as possible, even when on the road, can have a huge benefit.\nRemi Mobed, a physiotherapist with an expertise in sleep who has worked with the England men's national teams in football and rugby, supports the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team.\nHe says their approach is the \"gold standard\" for managing sleep in elite-level sport.\n\"In a group stage of a Tour de France, the cyclists are going to be in approximately 20 different hotels over the course of 22 days,\" he says.\n\"Each of those cyclists has their own dehumidifier, their own mattress, their own duvet and their own pillow that come as a travel pack. The team travels with that and the soigneur goes ahead and prepares the athlete's room for them prior to arrival, every day for 22 days.\n\"The reality for other team sports is to do the basics as well as you can, like getting the athletes to travel with an eye mask and their own pillow from home.\"\nIneos Grenadiers' Carlos Rodriguez, who benefits from Mobed's insight, finished seventh in the 2024 Tour de France\nDoubles tennis player Neal Skupski - a three-time Wimbledon champion - travels all over the world on the ATP Tour. For him, the constant change of location is part of the challenge.\n\"You're sleeping in a different bed each week - some mattresses hard, some soft,\" the 35-year-old says. \n\u201cFor a lot of the guys [the problem] is the pillows - they can mess you up. You can wake up with a bad neck and then you can't turn, and that hurts you especially on the serve.\n\"In the Olympic village in Paris last summer, one of the manufacturers allowed people to go to them and change the mattress hardness or softness. There was a line way out the door of athletes going in, testing the bed, trying to get a softer or harder one that suited them. The queue was so long I couldn't believe my eyes!\"\nCompeting worldwide requires athletes to traverse time zones and adjust their sleep schedules accordingly. So far in 2025, Skupski has played in Australia, Japan, Qatar, the UAE, and the US.\n\"People see players at tournaments on TV and sometimes think that they should be playing better, but it is probably down to the fact that their body is just knackered,\" the Liverpudlian says.\n\"I stay up as long as possible on a plane. Then if I get to Australia 12 o'clock in the afternoon, I would definitely stay up all day until around 10pm, just trying getting on the new time zone straight away.\n\"For the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Andy Murray was trying to get on time zone back in the UK a week in advance. So he was getting up around 2am and then starting his day, which I found crazy. But then he had a much better sleep when he got to Tokyo than me, so maybe I should have listened to him.\u201d\nMobed adds: \"As a general rule, if you're jumping three time zones, your body is able to cope with it. On top of that, it takes an athlete one day per hour that they've travelled to adjust.\n\"So if the difference is seven hours, the first three are fine to adjust to, and then it would be four days for the final four hours to be fully adjusted. Going across to Australia or New Zealand, 12 or 13 hours ahead, then that is a much bigger task.\"\nSkupski has represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup around the world since 2019\nIn team sports, athletes often share hotel rooms with a team-mate while travelling to away matches or international competitions.\n\"Coaches overlook sleep as a major factor,\" Mobed says. \"They often partner the strikers together, for instance, or the fly-halves, because the coaches want them to be discussing tactics. It is a mentorship system, thinking, 'this young kid can learn from Harry Kane through small conversations in the hotel room'.\n\"But the hotel room is not somewhere that should be done. That should be a place that is sacrosanct for the athletes to be in a relaxed state.\n\"You need to figure out who are the night owls and who are the morning larks. It is no good putting people in at the opposite end of the scale.\"\nAccording to NHS data, more than a million people in the UK were prescribed medication to help with sleep in 2023. Addiction to sleeping pills can lead to withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, panic attacks, sweating, headaches and shaking.\nBrentford captain Christian Norgaard revealed he feared becoming addicted to sleeping pills during his time with Brondby in his native Denmark, saying a sleep coach helped him avoid developing a serious problem.\n\"Sleeping pills are a really taboo subject in sport,\" Mobed says. \"There are many athletes, unfortunately, that are addicted to these sleep-enhancing meds.\n\"I think there is a time and a place for them, but the basics of sleep hygiene must be addressed first. Athletes often won't prioritise sleep, because they know that they can go to the doctor and get a sleeping pill.\n\"They can stay in your system for quite a prolonged period after you wake up. So let's say it gets to 1am and you're not sleeping so you take some of these meds - they are definitely still in your system the next morning.\"\nMelatonin is a hormone which can also be taken as a supplement to help sleep, but despite some of his doubles partners using it in the past, Skupski prefers to manage his sleep naturally\nNot everybody needs to be as precise about their sleep hygiene as an elite athlete, but getting good-quality sleep is important for the health and wellbeing of everyone.\n\"Naps should be no more than 40 minutes long, ideally 20,\" Mobed offers as a key tip. \"Some people will nap for one hour, two hours, three hours during the day, and that will have a massive detrimental effect.\n\"You've got this napping vicious cycle - sleeping too much in the day can actually completely put out your rhythm, and then at night you're not going to sleep well. You're then being counter-productive because the drowsiness goes into the next day.\"\nFor Skupski, one crucial change has made a big difference.\n\"I was waking up in the middle of the night and thinking, 'why am I wide awake?',\u201c he says.\n\"I was having coffee too late at night - having dinner and then a coffee around 7 or 8pm. One of the doctors told me you shouldn't be taking in coffee after 4pm because caffeine can stay in your system for eight hours.\"",

It's amazing,\" he says.\nIt even makes the three-hour commute he makes some days to train with the likes of UFC interim champion Tom Aspinall and KSW heavyweight champion Phil De Fries worth it.\n\"I could be going to like a building site in the freezing cold, which I would absolutely hate,\" he adds. \n\"I enjoy this, or sometimes it's a bit 'what are you being sad for? You've got an amazing life at the moment'.\"\nParkin is on a four-fight winning streak in the UFC. He signed with the UFC after just six bouts on his record.\nThe Sunderland man has been somewhat fast-tracked in the promotion thanks in part to the ever-changing nature of the division he fights in and his closeness with one of the UFC's biggest star, Aspinall.\nHe earned a spot on Dana White's Contender Series in 2022 and won himself a UFC contract with a first-round stoppage.\nBefore then, Parkin was working security at a bar, regularly travelling to Sunderland games.\nHis mother pushed him to try out the jiu-jitsu gym and from there he transitioned from kickboxing into MMA.\n\"I don't think I'd be anywhere near where I'm at now without Phil and Tom and coach [Andrew] Fisher,\" he says.\n\"I went [to train with Aspinall] and I thought I was really good and I just got knocked off. Really bad. I thought, 'oh my god', I'm useless at this. It's like starting again.\nHe adds: \"I know I haven't had many fights in the UFC but I'm already ranked. \n\"Heavyweight, you get pushed a little bit more, because there's just not many of us.\nDe Fries - globetrotter finds home as KSW heavyweight champ\nParkin trains with Phil De Fries (left) and Tom Aspinall during his camps\nThe heavyweight scene in the UK has often been scarce. Parkin says he turned pro because he struggled for opponents in the amateur ranks.\nBut recent years have seen two key men emerge and find success in very different factions. \nManchester fighter Aspinall, 31, shot through the UFC ranks and is now the number one heavyweight contender in the UFC, waiting for his shot at champion and legend Jon Jones.\nSunderland's De Fries, 38, is one of KSW's biggest star. He is the European promotion powerhouse's most dominant champion with eleven successful defences since 2018.\n'Extraordinary' - the case for Aspinall to fight Jones in numbers\nParkin sits number 13 in the UFC's rankings. He fights number eight contender Marcin Tybura at UFC London on Saturday. \nThe heavyweight division, not unlike boxing, continues to dominate attention in the UFC.\nThe scene is primed for another heavyweight to step up and under the tutelage of Aspinall and De Fries, Parkin could be that fighter.\nBut that doesn't mean Parkin has any aspirations to fight Aspinall in the future, quite the opposite.\n\"I wouldn't want to fight him. He's my friend, but I was hoping by the time I got there he'd be completely done, and maybe hopefully get this Jon Jones fight and get loads of money and retire,\" Parkin says.\n\"But I'm still loads of fights off that yet, and like, unless it was for crazy money, I just wouldn't want to fight him, really.\n\"I'm 13th ranked now. I know I'm fighting eighth but there's still potentially 15 guys I have to beat to even get there.\"\n\"I think Tybura had like 20 odd UFC fights,\" Parkin adds. \n\"So you kind of can't be not good having 20 UFC fights, you know. I do think I'm probably better than him. I do believe that.\"\nMMA schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nHampson reflects on life-altering injury and life-changing influence\nMatt Hampson could not breathe by himself and was drifting in and out of consciousness when medics cut his England jersey off him.\nIt was half a lifetime ago that the now 40-year-old was in intensive care, having been left paralysed from the neck down when a scrum collapsed in a training session with the Under-21 national team.\nHe recalls the faces around him immediately after the incident, the \"shell-shocked\" looks, the sense of helplessness when he could not feel his arms and legs, and waking up in the back of an ambulance after \"blacking out\" before being resuscitated.\nHe was only 20 years old then. Now, 20 years on, the former Leicester Tigers prop remembers how it all felt \"so surreal\" when he was rushed to Northampton General Hospital.\nThe injury left Hampson only able to breathe through a ventilator and as \"bizarre and scary\" as that struck him at the time, he admits he was momentarily distracted from the life-changing chaos of it all.\n\"Having my England kit that I was so proud of being cut off me with scissors was a small trivial thing I was thinking of,\" Hampson told BBC East Midlands Today.\n\"I was so proud of playing for England with the rose on my chest, and then having that kit cut off me, I was just thinking of that rather than thinking of myself.\"\nHampson had started the day - 15 March, 2005 - by slipping that England shirt on as one of the nation's finest rising rugby union prospects.\nIt was with the academy at Leicester Tigers, a club renowned for developing forwards of fierce pedigree, that Hampson worked hard to gain that reputation.\n\"I wasn't a natural rugby player, but I wanted it, I was hungry for it and was passionate about it,\" he said.\n\"Rugby was my purpose and what I could do to channel my energy. I felt like it was my calling.\"\nHampson reflects on foundation's work as he turns 40\nI was too busy to die - Hampson\n'Get busy living or get busy dying' - Hampson reflects on injury 10 years on \nThat calling, however, was silenced in harrowing circumstances which sent him in a different direction.\nHe would go on to spend 18 months at Stoke Mandeville Hospital - home of the National Spinal Injuries Centre - and after that he said there was \"a lot of soul searching\" about what would come next.\n\"You are a rugby player, so to redefine yourself was massively important,\" he said.\n\"It was obviously a turning point in my life and initially I struggled to justify why it happened to me and why life would never be the same again. But now I understand.\"\nHe says this while at the Get Busy Living Centre, a state-of-the art facility that he is the driving force behind, which offers total support to those in a similar situation.\nThe centre, which is nestled among farmland outside Melton Mowbray in rural Leicestershire, is also home of the foundation set up in Hampson's name.\n\"I come into the driveway and see the foundation and centre and this is what it's all about,\" he said.\n\"This is why it happened. Realising how much support I had and how many people that I'd be able to help and influence, just through my journey and my story - to show people that there is a great life to be had in this situation.\"\nMatt Hampson was awarded an OBE in 2022 and received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Leicester in January\nIt was the support that Hampson got after his accident that made him realise what could be possible.\nIn hospital he was visited by so many people that he ended up needing a booking system to stay on top of it all. As a high-profile injury that rocked the rugby world, there was also a lot of money donated to help him and his family cope.\nHe knew he was \"blessed\" to be in that position, but also saw that many were not so fortunate.\n\"It didn't just come to me straightaway,\" Hampson said of plans for his foundation and the centre. \"The trust fund was sort of thrust upon me where people were raising money for me. \n\"I felt very grateful for that and I felt that I needed to give something back. The natural progression for the trust was to turn into a foundation, a charity to help other people.\n\"The most worthwhile thing we can do in our life is to make an impression on someone else's life.\"\nHow many people the foundation and centre have supported over the years, Hampson can't put an exact number on.\nBut it is hundreds who have sought access to expert physiotherapists, specialist personal trainers, wellbeing support and other tailored healthy living advice at the centre.\nAccommodation has been set up there recently to help offer even greater levels of access, and there are further redevelopment plans for the site and aspirations to expand its reach with satellite centres around the country.\nSome people who have come through the centre have even gone on establish themselves as athletes, competing at the Paralympic Games. Among them are Nick Cummins and Jamie Stead, who were both part of ParalympicsGB's gold medal-winning wheelchair rugby side at the Tokyo games in 2021.\nGraham Lee, a Grand National-winning jockey who suffered a spinal injury in 2024 in a riding accident, went direct to the centre from hospital to start his rehabilitation.\n\"The second I got out of the van, Matt was there,\" Lee said. \"He is a class act in every way.\"\nWhen Hampson turned 40 last year, he spoke of his pride in how he, and those he works with, have \"shaken things up for the disability world\".\n\"The world is a lot more inclusive. You were just existing back then,\" Hampson said when reflecting on the support he received after he first left hospital with his injury.\n\"Now you can get busy living and you can do things. It's a challenge, every day is a challenge, but it makes it enjoyable and makes it worthwhile.\n\"You feel like you are actually getting somewhere, actually changing the world for disabled people but also changing the world for a lot of other people as well.\n\"I'm immensely proud of what we do here.\"\nNatalie Jackson, BBC East Midlands Today sports editor:\nI have been covering Matt Hampson's story for 20 years and first met him in Stoke Mandeville Hospital not long after his accident. \nWhen he was first injured he could only communicate by blinking and clicking, and his injury is the worst level of tetraplegia \u2013 paralysed  from the neck down and on a ventilator.  \nHe was in hospital for 18 months and I filmed with him during his last week in hospital before he came home. \nI was nervous about meeting him because I was worried about saying the wrong thing but he instantly put me at ease with his smile, humour and positivity. And that mental strength he has used ever since to change the way people view disability and to shake up the disability world, changing and saving hundreds of lives. \nHe has an incredible ability to know what people need. \nI have seen people take their first steps at his centre and seen him take people from a dark place and transform their lives, proving that you can have a full and incredible life after a spinal injury \u2013 Getting Busy Living.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nFrance thrash Scotland to become Six Nations champions\nHalf an hour played in Paris and things are a little testy. \nFrance's discipline is rank. They've had two men in the bin. Peato Mauvaka somehow escapes a full red for a diving headbutt on Ben White. And Darcy Graham has just scored. \nIt's 13-10 to the championship-chasers, but it's stressed.\nThe stadium cameras pick out Antoine Dupont in the crowd and the place erupts. To these people, it's like an apparition. God is with us, so have faith.\nApart from the cacophony that greeted the tries that came in a dominant second half, the roars for Dupont - in that moment of need and again later as he lifted the trophy with the stand-in captain Gregory Alldritt - were the loudest of the night.\nAnd what a night. What an era they might be entering. As the fireworks crackled, the tinsel fell and the lap of honour snaked around the vast stadium, it felt like the beginning of something. \nFrance overpower Scotland to win Six Nations title\nFrance's Bielle-Biarrey breaks Six Nations try record\nHow final day unfolded as France win Six Nations\nTo say that French rugby is in rude order is putting it mildly.\nFirst, a moment of reflection. Saturday was not the time or the place to ponder what might have been for this team - not when everybody was losing their mind at the joy of it all - but the realisation will dawn at some point that this should have been a Grand Slam season for Les Bleus.\nThat one inexplicable blip at Twickenham will confound experts for the rest of time. \nOne of the great wings of his generation (Damian Penaud) and arguably the greatest player ever (Dupont) both fumbled glorious chances to score. It's as surreal now as it was in real time.\nNearly everything else France have done this season has had world class written all over it. \nThe 43-0 drubbing of Wales on opening night was a record home win over the visitors. It was the first time they'd 'nilled' the Welsh in the championship in more than a quarter of a century.\nThe 73 points they put on Italy was the second highest total in a match in the history of the competition.\nThe trip to Dublin, billed as the clash of the heavyweights, turned into a one-sided romp. With awesome power and gorgeous subtlety, France put in one of the greatest away Six Nations performances that anybody can remember.\nIt was Ireland's biggest defeat at home in 12 years and France's total of 42 points was the most they'd scored in that fixture on Irish soil.\nThis video can not be played\nBielle-Biarrey scores try for France\nGame by game, they threatened to rewrite the record books. Before Saturday, there were potential milestones at every turn. \nThey needed four tries to get to 30 for the tournament, thereby breaking a mark set by England 24 years ago. \nThey duly broke that record just after the hour when Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Gael Fickou set up Yoram Moefana for a clinical score that showed France at their best.\nBielle-Biarrey already had a slice of history with an all-time high of 11 try involvements but he was looking for more. Another score would have taken him to eight for the championship - a record for the Six Nations. He delivered. Again.\nHis try early in the second half, a breakaway thing sparked by Ntamack, was crucial as it set France on their way. He now joins England's Cyril Lowe and Scotland's Ian Smith in a holy trinity who have scored eight championship tries in a single season.\nGiven that those two gentlemen did their thing in 1914 and 1925, you get a sense of the scale of what the young Bordeaux wizard has been doing.\nOthers turned up with collective glory and individual immortality in mind. \nBefore kick-off, Penaud was level with Serge Blanco as France's most prolific try-scorer. One more and he was out on his own, a new record of 39 tries in his 56th appearance. It took Blanco 93 games to get the mountain top in the first place.\nPenaud will have to wait for another day, but Thomas Ramos overtook Frederic Michalak's record of 436 points for his country. Another history man.\nIn their clear blue sky, the one cloud is the lack of a Slam, but given where French rugby is right now you wonder how much longer they'll be waiting. Prediction: not very long at all.\nFrench clubs have won the last four Champions Cup and three of the past four Challenge Cups. It would be the least surprising thing in global rugby if that trend continued in a few months.\nToulouse, the reigning champions, have already beaten Ulster 61-21, Exeter 64-21 and Leicester 80-12. Bordeaux, the fiercely impressive contenders, have put 69 points on Exeter and 66 points on the Sharks. They're a pair of behemoths.\nEngland are improving, Ireland regressing, but France are steaming ahead. On Friday they won the Under-20 Six Nations for the first time since 2018.\nThough still kids, 18 of the 23 that beat Scotland have played for their clubs this season. Toulouse, Bordeaux, Toulon, La Rochelle - all the biggest French guns have given game time to their youth. They start them early here.\nTheir under-age system has seen them win three of the past four Junior World Cups and they were beaten in the final of the other. One of the scariest things for everybody else is the age profile.\nTheo Attissogbe - three tries in his two games in the championship - is only 20. Bielle-Biarrey, Oscar Jegou and Hugo Auradou, all involved on Saturday, are 21. Nolann le Garrec, who was Maxime Lucu's deputy, is 22. Leo Barre, not in the squad for the denouement but scorer of two tries in his one game, is also 22.\nThere are other potential superstars waiting in the wings - Marko Gazzotti, the brilliant 20-year-old back-row from Bordeaux; Emilien Gailleton, the outstanding 21-year-old centre from Pau; Nicolas Depoortere, already an important figure in a magnificent Bordeaux backline at the age of 22.\nThe list isn't endless, but it can feel like it at times. \nAs they whooped and hollered and paraded the trophy around the Stade de France, you got an overwhelming sense that this Belle Epoque in rugby boots is only just getting started.",

        "article_text": "Made in Canada.\nThree words that are now a common presence on Canadian shelves, after Donald Trump's tariffs sparked a trade war with the US's northern neighbour.\nIn Canada the economic measures against it have been met with a wave of patriotism, with some consumers and businesses boycotting American products. \nOthers with operations in the US face a choice - ride out the uncertainty or bring their enterprise back home.\n\"Right now, I'm a little angry. I don't want to invest in American companies,\" says Joanna Goodman, owner of Au Lit Fine Linens, a Toronto-based bedding and nightwear company.\n\"It's about having your eggs in one basket. And right now, that basket is very reckless and very precarious,\" she continues.\nOn a tour around one of her firm's two stores, housed in a giant warehouse, Ms Goodman highlights elegantly made-up beds, mannequins in silk pyjamas, and shelves full of sweet-smelling candles \u2013 most of it made in Canada.\nBut one fifth of the stock currently comes from the US. Ms Goodman is quick to point out, \"you see how big the store is, so even 20% is a lot\".\n\"I have a lot of inventory here of American brands that I've had relationships with for 20 years. I'm not going to throw it away,\" she says. \"The question is, will I reorder?\"\nTo show Au Lit Fine Linens' commitment to Canadian manufacturers, its stores now highlight everything that is Canadian made. This is mirrored on its website, which has a \"shop all made in Canada\" section, and says \"made right here at home\".\nFrom Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, to the Ukraine war, global events in recent years have given rise to a more recent phenomenon \u2013 reshoring.\nBringing business operations back to home shores, it is the reversal of offshoring.\nBusiness leader and recently-appointed new member of Canada's Senate, Sandra Pupatello, says that reshoring is \"really obvious\" to support.\nPupatello, who had previously been Ontario's Minister of Economic Development and Trade, points to the Covid-19 pandemic, when rules of trade \"went right out the window\".\nShe specifically cites the example of US mask manufacturer 3M coming under pressure from the White House in 2020 to halt exports to Canada and Latin America.\nIn that moment Pupatello thought: \"We've got to be prepared for the worst\".\nShortly after, she established Reshoring Canada, a non-partisan group advocating for a more resilient supply chain in Canada.\nPupatello tells the BBC: \"If the going gets tough, Canada is on its own. And if we know that's the case, let us plan for it.\"\nA Canadian government report from last year found that there had \"not been signs of either large-scale or any notable increased reshoring by businesses\", but things could now be changing.\nRay Brougham has been trying to make inroads into the Canadian car manufacturing sector since establishing his company Rainhouse Manufacturing Canada in 2001. Based in British Columbia, it manufactures parts for a number of industries.\nThe North American car industry's integrated supply chains can see parts crossing the borders between the US, Mexico, and Canada multiple times before a vehicle is finally assembled.\nUS President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare US carmakers from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect in March.\nBut in the shadow of a trade war, Mr Brougham says he has had \"good communications\" with a large Canadian auto parts company for the first time ever. \"All of a sudden they are interested in working closer with other Canadian companies.\"\nFor Mr Brougham and others, the benefits of reshoring are clear. From giving a leg up to small companies that have struggled to compete with manufacturers overseas, to ensuring fair wages, and the environmental benefits of importing and exporting fewer goods.\nOthers, including Graham Markham, director of a food sector supplier, believe it's about adding value to products Canada already produces.\nHis Canadian firm New Protein International is currently constructing Canada's first soy protein manufacturing plant in southwest Ontario, just miles from the US border.\nCanada is the world's fourth-largest exporter of the crop, but most of it is processed overseas.\n\"We don't process those value-added ingredients into more valuable ingredients here at home,\" says Mr Markham.\nFrom critical minerals and uranium to lumber and soybeans, he argues that this is the moment to change.\n\"Canada has long been a successful supplier of raw materials to the world. The opportunity now is to stop exporting the job creation and innovation that comes from processing those materials domestically.\"\nSo, could manufacturing start coming back to Canada?  Economist Randall Bartlett says it is too early to tell.\n\"There's a lot more smoke than there is fire when it comes to actual reorganisation of supply chains and moving them domestically,\" says Mr Bartlett, senior director of Canadian economics at Quebec-based Desjardins.\n\"I think there has been some movement toward reshoring, but I think there's a lot more narrative around it than there is actual re-establishing of manufacturing capacity.\"\nThere are major hurdles too.\nThe highly-integrated auto industry, for example, would take years to untangle. Reshoring it would require \"many tens of hundreds of billions of dollars in both private and public sector investment to make happen\", according to Mr Bartlett.\nThen there's the reality of global trade.\n\"Some countries are better at producing some things than other countries are,\" Mr Bartlett says, suggesting that rather than a full reshoring push, diversifying Canada's trade partners might be more practical.\nHe says that Canada should focus on \"those industries where we have a comparative advantage\", which he says include renewable energy and processing steel and aluminium. Those two metals have now been hit with a 25% tariff if they are exported to the US.\nBack at Au Lit Fine Linens in Toronto, Joanna Goodman steps into a vast stockroom, filled with the sound of carboard boxes being packed.\n\"We're shipping orders to the US that came in pre-tariffs,\" she explains, before pausing.  \"We did get an order the day of the tariffs starting, and it was a very decent-sized order.\"\nShe says that she doesn't know whether the US buyer understands that tariffs will now apply. \"He has to ask Mr Trump [why]\".\nAs for what comes next?  \"These tariffs could be gone any day. Let's see how it all unfolds, then we'll start making decisions,\" says Ms Goodman.\nLike many Canadian businesses, she's waiting for the dust to settle before deciding where to buy, where to sell, and what Made in Canada really means for the future.",

        "article_text": "In Japan, a smelly waste product is being reimagined as a potential clean fuel of the future that is powering cars and tractors.\nWe're being eyed suspiciously by dozens of cows. Their breath fogs cartoonishly from their nostrils.\nIt's a brisk morning in snowy Hokkaido, an island in the north of Japan. The cold air carries the distinct scent of cow manure \u2013 a smelly yet familiar side-effect of the region's thriving dairy industry. Accounting for 20% of the country's landmass, this island is the second-largest in Japan. It's also home to over a million cows, which produce over half of the country's milk and dairy products.\nWe are visiting one farm in Hokkaido that wants to transform the source of the pungent aroma in the air into something valuable. They are turning cattle manure into hydrogen.\u00a0\nWhen it is burned, hydrogen does not emit carbon, making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. There are widespread hopes it could be used as a sustainable fuel to heat homes and power cars, trains, aircraft and ships in the future.\nBut the most common way of producing hydrogen today involves using methane \u2013 a fossil fuel piped up from deep underground, meaning it is still associated with significant carbon emissions. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting water using electricity, but this can be expensive and is only low carbon if renewable sources of electricity are used.\nThe Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm, however, is using a different source \u2013 a waste product that there is no shortage of on Hokkaido. Around 20 million tonnes of cow manure is generated in Hokkaido annually. If not treated correctly, it can be an environmental burden, producing significant methane emissions as well as affecting water quality if allowed to leak into streams and rivers. So can it instead be used as a source of sustainable energy?\n\"This project to produce hydrogen from livestock manure originated in Japan and is unique to this place,\" says Maiko Abe from Air Water, one of several companies involved in the hydrogen farm project. We are visiting the facility in Shikaoi, a town in central Hokkaido, to film an upcoming episode of the BBC's TechXplore focusing on Japan. \"Shikaoi accounts for 30% of Hokkaido\u2019s cow waste and urine, so it has great potential for renewable energy.\"\nLaunched in 2015 by Japan\u2019s Ministry of the Environment, the project aims to convert agricultural by-products into hydrogen to supply the local, rural community in a circular economy.\u00a0The cow excrement and urine is collected from local dairy farms before being fed into a anaerobic digester at a central facility. Here bacteria break down the organic waste to produce biogas and a liquid fertiliser. The biogas is then purified into methane that is used to manufacture hydrogen.\nThe plant now has a hydrogen production capacity of 70 cubic metres (18,500 gallons), with an onsite fuelling station that can fill around 28 vehicles fitted with hydrogen fuel cells per day, says Abe. Although the fuel can be used by cars with fuel cells, the plant's fuelling station has been specially designed to accommodate agricultural vehicles such as tractors and forklift trucks. These farm vehicles are difficult to electrify with batteries due to their size and the type of work they do. The hydrogen-powered vehicles are used around the farms' sites, reducing the emissions that would otherwise be created by using other fuel sources.\u00a0\nCattle-made-hydrogen is also stored in canisters that are transported to provide power and heat to other facilities in the area, including a local sturgeon fish farm and the nearby Obihiro Zoo.\nBut hydrogen isn't without its problems. It needs to be stored in high-pressure tanks as a gas, and can be prone to leakage due to its low molecular weight. It can also degrade metal storage containers, leaving them embrittled, and is easily ignited and so requires additional safety precautions when handling it.\nHydrogen can also be stored as a liquid by chilling it to cryogenic temperatures of below \u2013253C (-423F), but this can be energy intensive and requires large amounts of additional infrastructure.\nHydrogen has nearly three times the energy content of petrol (gasoline) when taken by mass alone. But its low molecular weight also means that by volume, the energy packed into a litre of liquid hydrogen is a quarter that of petrol. Put simply, as the lightest gas in the Universe, hydrogen takes up more space kilogram for kilogram than petrol. This means a lot more storage space is needed for hydrogen compared to fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and natural gas. It also means producing and storing it at scale can require large amounts of energy and infrastructure.\nBut as well as these hurdles, the hydrogen farm project in Hokkaido also faces other challenges specific to northern Japan's climate.\nHokkaido's subzero winters means new technologies are needed to produce the hydrogen stably without the small amounts of water vapour in the methane freezing.\nUsing agricultural waste as a methane source to produce hydrogen is relatively uncommon, but it ultimately uses\u00a0the same process as is used to produce hydrogen from natural gas: steam reforming. Here, steam heated to 800C (1,472F) reacts with the methane to produce hydrogen, along with the byproducts carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (CO2).\u00a0\nIn the case of cow manure, however, says Abe, the project remains sustainable as this carbon originated in the grass the cows grazed on: \"Since it was originally in the atmosphere, it is considered carbon neutral.\"\nIn addition, it helps to prevent the methane that would otherwise have been emitted from the manure from getting into the atmosphere, where it is a potent greenhouse gas.\nLeftover slurry from the manure after the biogas has been extracted is sprayed as fertiliser onto nearby fields, while formic acid \u2013 which is both used in and created by the processes \u2013 could be offered as a preservative for cattle feed, says Abe.\u00a0\nCurrently, the electricity needed to produce and store the hydrogen comes from the national grid. But Abe says there's potential to shift to green energy, given Hokkaido\u2019s promising sea, wind and geothermal potential, thus reducing the carbon emissions of this electricity.\nStill, other challenges remain. The high cost of the hydrogen compared to fossil fuels and low demand mean expanding the operation is difficult.\u00a0\n\"The construction costs of hydrogen stations are very high,\" says Abe. \"Since hydrogen vehicles are not yet widespread, we're keeping our filling capacity low to manage initial investment. As adoption increases, we'll expand supply.\"\nTo encourage hydrogen vehicle adoption in the area, hydrogen prices are subsidised by the plant, matching the cost of petrol. Hydrogen refuelling stations are also being developed in major Hokkaido cities like Sapporo and Muroran.\nHype Meter\nThe process to make clean hydrogen fuel from cow manure in Shikaoi Hydrogen Farm is worth paying attention to, especially as it also reduces methane which would otherwise be released from the manure. With other countries exploring how to use other types of waste, from pig dung to coconut husks, to produce hydrogen using similar processes, it appears this could be a model adaptable to other local contexts.\nWith the scale still small, however, and costs of production high, it remains to be seen how widespread this industry can be. There are also other ways of producing fuel from cow waste, such as simply using the biogas produced from manure as a fuel itself without needing to convert it to hydrogen.\u00a0\nJapan is the world leader in hydrogen vehicles and has invested considerably in developing the technology. But for now battery-powered electric vehicles remain cheaper than hydrogen powered ones.\nThough it's unlikely that cow manure alone will ever meet Japan's hydrogen demand, it could contribute significantly, and Shikaoi is creating a model for a circular economy that it hopes will show how costs can fall with the economies of scale.\u00a0\nAnd there is growing interest in other parts of the world in using waste materials to produce hydrogen, with pig dung, poultry waste and even coconut husks having been explored as potential feedstocks. In Thailand, vehicle manufacturer Toyota is even exploring the use of hydrogen made from chicken waste to fuel its vehicles.\nMeanwhile, engineers at the University of Illinois Chicago in the US recently developed another promising method to make hydrogen involving manure. In their case, they used the manure, along with sugarcane waste and corn husks, to make biochar, a carbon-rich substance which vastly reduces the amount of electricity needed to convert water to hydrogen.\n\"We are the first group to show that you can produce hydrogen utilising biomass at a fraction of a volt,\" says Meenesh Singh, a chemical engineer at the University of Illinois Chicago who led the project.\nIn the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, on Kyushu, meanwhile, another waste product is being used to produce hydrogen \u2013 and here the dung is from humans.\nFor more than a decade, hydrogen has been created at the city's sewage treatment plant for use in hydrogen-powered vehicles. Most recently it has been used to fuel a fleet of zero-emission rubbish trucks.\nAkira Miyaoka, hydrogen utilisation manager for Fukuoka City, says trucks that transport daily products are the town's main source of CO2, rather than large factories as in many other cities. \"So we are working to reduce CO2 emissions from commercial trucks,\" she says.\nThe initiative started as a collaboration between Kyushu University and Fukuoka City, but now involves several major companies including Toyota.\n\"Sewage is something that is steadily discharged every day in the daily lives of citizens, so by making effective use of that sewage and extracting hydrogen as energy, we can achieve local production and local consumption of energy,\" says Miyaoka.\u00a0\nGenerating hydrogen from human waste starts with water from various household sources \u2013 including showers, dishwashers and toilets \u2013 arriving at the treatment plant. As the water is cleaned, the residual sludge is kept as a source of biogas and converted into hydrogen.\u00a0\n\"Sewage and biogas contain various impurities, so the process begins with the process of removing those impurities, which I think is a little different from other hydrogen production processes,\" says Miyaoka.\nIn 2024, Toyota helped the city launch Japan\u2019s first hydrogen-powered service vehicle fleet, including ambulances, delivery vans and bin trucks. Officials at the sewage treatment plant say it is capable of producing 300kg (661lbs) of hydrogen in 12 hours \u2013 enough to fuel 30 trucks.\u00a0\nThe rubbish trucks head out six nights each week, each collecting 1.7 tonnes (3,700lb) of rubbish, all while running silently and emission-free on the bodily waste of the people they are collecting other waste from.\nFukuoka's sewage-to-hydrogen fuelling station has been around since 2015, and several other countries around the world are now adopting a similar approach.\nConcord Blue has developed waste-to-energy plants in Germany, India, Japan and the US, converting waste and biomass into hydrogen and bioenergy. Several water authorities in the UK are also working on projects to derive hydrogen from sewage.\nA prototype race car has also been developed using sewage-derived hydrogen in the UK. The Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), in partnership with Severn Trent Water, is harnessing microbes that generate hydrogen fuel from waste. They anticipate the technology could hit the mainstream within five years, despite existing challenges. (Read about how sewage-powered cars could be the future of motorsport.)\nOn a larger scale, aviation accounts for 2% of global carbon emissions, and researchers in a UK lab have developed jet fuel made entirely from human sewage.\nStill, despite the promise, all of these technologies have yet to be delivered at significant scale.\nWhether in rural or city landscapes, the Japanese projects we've seen during in filming are inspiring because they have the local community at their heart.\nWhile adoption of hydrogen cars has stalled, hydrogen truck adoption is increasing gradually and it is these larger heavier industrial vehicles that contribute most significantly per vehicle to greenhouse gas emissions.\nBy reimagining waste as a resource, these projects demonstrate that energy can be found in even the most unlikely of places.\n* Paul Carter is the presenter of TechXplore.

Live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nThere was no fairytale for Lewis Hamilton on his first competitive outing for Ferrari, as Formula 1's most celebrated driver began his career with the sport's most iconic team.\nThe seven-time world champion qualified only eighth for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix - one place and 0.218 seconds slower than his team-mate Charles Leclerc, and a whopping 0.877secs behind Lando Norris' McLaren on pole position.\nAfterwards, Hamilton was repeating the mantra he has been using for some time - that it is going to take a little time before he is fully up to speed with his new car and team.\n\"For me, just improving every single lap, session on session,\" he said. \"Big learning curve this weekend.\n\"The car was so much different than I have ever experienced here and it's been a lot slower process to build confidence in the car.\n\"In the high-speed [corners], I have been down all weekend to Charles, who has had confidence from the get-go. He knew what the car does. I was just building up to that. I got a lot closer in the end and to be that close to Charles in my first qualifying session against a great qualifier...\"\nNorris takes Melbourne pole with Hamilton eighth\nAustralian Grand Prix Qualifying Review\nHe didn't complete the sentence, but the meaning was clear - Leclerc is blindingly fast; everyone knows that. So from Hamilton's point of view, in terms of his own relative performance, this was a perfectly decent start.\nThe same could not be said of Ferrari themselves. Hamilton is at Ferrari with one objective only - to win an eighth world title. Leclerc himself spoke on Thursday about winning a championship with Ferrari being his \"obsession\". Neither will achieve their aims with a car that qualifies on the fourth row of the grid.\nLeclerc was perplexed by what had happened. He had been quick all weekend, and fourth fastest in the first qualifying session, just over 0.1secs off Norris, who topped all three. But it became progressively worse as the hour developed.\n\"As soon as we started to push the car more and more,\" Leclerc said, \"we found more and more inconsistency, which was a bit of a shame.\n\"We lost the pace a little bit through qualifying. In Q1 we were good, in Q2 we were less good and in Q3 we had to push a lot to try and nail the lap time. We didn't really follow the track for some reason.\n\"This car has a lot of potential but for now we don't seem to be in the right window, so we have to find it.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBig surprises & how will Hamilton do?: BBC 5 Live team share 2025 predictions\nIt was a sobering start to a season that all in F1 had expected to start with Ferrari as McLaren's closest challenger. But not everyone felt it was necessarily a reflection of the team's true potential.\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"I am certainly surprised at the gap between McLaren and Ferrari. But I would say more, I just don't take that gap at face value.\n\"I'm sure the potential of the red car is higher than for some reasons was possible to exploit today. I think we have seen that until possibly qualifying in every single session, even in Bahrain [at pre-season testing].\n\"So we are very realistic that Ferrari is definitely one of the main contenders.\"\nLando Norris has spent his entire F1 career with McLaren since making his debut in 2019\nHamilton at Ferrari - his personal quest for success, and the internal battle with Leclerc - is one of the dominant narratives at the start of this season.\nAnother is whether Norris can deliver on his ambition to mount a season-long title challenge from the off, rather than having to play catch-up - which he had to try to do last year because McLaren did not start on Red Bull's level.\nIn the end in Melbourne, McLaren did deliver on their potential, but not without a few scary moments.\nFacing a tougher challenge from Red Bull and Max Verstappen than they - and the four-time champion himself - had expected, Norris and Oscar Piastri both made mistakes on their first laps in the final part of qualifying.\nThat put them under pressure on their last runs - lacking a competitive first lap always makes finding the right balance of risk and reward on that all-important final lap much more difficult, because the penalty of making a mistake is so much greater.\nFor home favourite Piastri, this was bad enough - he was fourth after his first run. Norris, though, was 10th, having had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits.\nBoth absolutely nailed it. Piastri, hoping to become the first Australian to win his home grand prix in F1, improved by a second, knocking Verstappen from the top, and Norris did even better, pipping his team-mate by 0.084secs.\nNorris said. \"It's a track where you've got to commit. You know what your target is, and once you turn in you're kind of hoping for the best in a lot of cases. You want to take those risks.\n\"Obviously, I took too many on my first lap and got track limits, so I was in a difficult position knowing how much risk I wanted to take. But I put it together well. It was just a clean lap, no mistakes, and that was enough. So happy. A perfect way to start the season.\"\nMcLaren ended last year with their first constructors' championship title for 26 years, and Stella has said they have taken some risks with \"innovative\" design in pushing for more performance from a car that was the fastest in the field for the second half of last year.\nAlthough all the teams arrived in Melbourne expecting them to be at the front, Norris on Thursday described the idea they might be a chunk ahead of the rest as \"short-sighted\".\nIn the end, at least on the quick, demanding street circuit of Albert Park, he was the one who had to recalibrate.\n\"It really was not necessarily our expectation to have a bit of a gap to the rest of the cars,\" Norris said, before pointing to the fact that the errors they made were due to the difficulty in nailing a lap in a car that has taken the team to new heights.\n\"The car is extremely quick. And when you put it together, it's unbelievable. It's just difficult to put it together. So really it was like a little fight between me and Oscar today, and it was a tough one.\"\nMax Verstappen retired with a brake failure after just four laps of last year's race in Melbourne\nVerstappen might have been pleasantly surprised to be best of the rest, but the 0.385secs margin between him and Norris, while perhaps expected, will have been less palatable.\nFor his team, though, there are concerns on more than one level. On top of the apparent gap to McLaren, there was the performance of their new recruit Liam Lawson.\nAfter paying off Sergio Perez to leave just seven months after being given a new two-year contract, the last thing Red Bull will have wanted to see was Lawson more than 0.6secs off Verstappen on the first day's practice.\nLawson was then hit with an engine problem that robbed him of the entire final session on Saturday. In that context, it was no surprise that he should struggle in qualifying.\nEven so, a first lap a second off Verstappen, and a mistake on his second - putting him on to the grass and down in 18th on the grid - was not a good start.\nLawson is two places behind 18-year-old Italian Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Hamilton's replacement at Mercedes. Antonelli, who will become the third youngest driver to start an F1 race on Sunday, had his qualifying compromised by damage to the floor of his car. The other Mercedes of George Russell will start alongside Verstappen in fourth.\nThere was an impressive performance from another rookie, Gabriel Bortoleto in the Sauber, a bad start to his first full season for Haas' British novice Oliver Bearman, and promise from Fernando Alonso in the Aston Martin that was not delivered when an off in the second session damaged his floor.\nHow to follow Australian Grand Prix on the BBC\nMany would want a straightforward first race of the season. But Albert Park has a habit of throwing up curveballs, and it seems the weather may oblige on Sunday, with rain predicted.\n\"It's a new car,\" Norris said. \"So there are a lot of unknowns and question marks about how it will perform. It's not always as simple as just putting on wets and having a crack.\n\"A bit of our pace potentially goes out of the window because it's harder to extract and show the difference of pace we had today. But we're in the best position to do that if we can. I know the chances of rain have been going down, but normally wet races and inter races are pretty exciting.\"\nWhat he did not mention is that the rain brings Verstappen - who would not expect to match the McLarens in a dry race - right into the picture.\nStella was less reticent.\n\"The only thing I can say about Max in the wet is that he is mega,\" he said. \"He can be a significant threat.\"\nHamilton, too, has made a reputation for being special when it rains. But his circumstances mean he will not be treating it with the usual smile.\n\"The wet has often been something I have enjoyed,\" Hamilton said. \"So it's a comfort zone for me but I am going out for the first time in the wet in an uncomfortable position because I have never driven this car.\n\"It is going to be a shock to the system when I first get out there, but I will be learning on the fly and giving it everything.\"\nBritish driver Nigel Mansell won his first race for Ferrari, at the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix.

        "article_text": "Every McDonald's in Britain has been warned its owners could face legal action if they fail to take steps to protect staff from sexual abuse.\nThe equality watchdog has written to all 1,400 branches telling them they must comply with their legal duties, or risk enforcement action, after a BBC investigation uncovered claims of a toxic culture of sexual assault and harassment.\nIn January, McDonald's workers told us they still faced sexual harassment more than a year after its chief executive promised to clean up behaviour at the fast-food chain.\nMcDonald's said it was \"committed\" to doing everything it can to ensure a safe working environment for all employees.\nIt added: \"We are confident that the plan we have in place is working.\"\nThe BBC has exclusively seen the letter from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\nWe asked one current McDonald's employee, who works for a franchise restaurant in southwest Scotland, for his reaction to it. He told us he hoped the intervention would lead to ''concrete change'' for people like him.\nThe 19-year-old worker, who we're calling Alan, told us in January he had been repeatedly subjected to \"degrading and humiliating\" verbal abuse by his colleagues, and faced \"homophobic slurs\".\nAlan still works there. He says things are not much different and he wants to \"get away\" from it.\nThe letter from the EHRC called the allegations in our investigation \"troubling\" and noted there have been \"repeated incidents\".\nThe vast majority of McDonald's restaurants are run by franchises, which means individual operators are licensed to run the outlets and employ the staff.\nIn February 2023, the watchdog entered into a legally binding agreement with McDonald's to prevent sexual harassment in its restaurants.\nFranchises were not covered by that agreement.\nBut in its latest letter, the EHRC said all businesses in Britain, small or large, must comply with the Equality Act.\n''It is your duty to ensure that any anti-discrimination and harassment measures you currently have in place are effective, and to take any necessary steps to protect your workers,\" the chief executive of the EHRC, John Kirkpatrick, told the restaurants.\nThe letter sets out the ''reasonable steps\" that restaurants could take to prevent sexual harassment.\nThese include regular risk assessments, ensuring younger and more vulnerable workers are properly safeguarded and ensuring complaints are dealt with sensitively and effectively through an established procedure.\nIt added that any franchise restaurant that does not comply with its legal duties \"may be at risk of enforcement action''.\nThe EHRC has a range of statutory enforcement powers open to it, including the ability to launch formal investigations.\nIf an organisation repeatedly refuses to comply, then the watchdog can take it through the courts, where an unlimited fine could be issued.\nLiam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, said the BBC's investigation of abuse at McDonald's had \"exposed malpractice which was totally and utterly unacceptable\".\nHe called for the EHRC to explain \"why it is only now writing to McDonald's restaurants about their new duty under the law, to prevent sexual harassment from taking place, when it came into effect nearly six months ago\".\nHe said it was \"especially concerning because the regulator has known about hundreds of allegations of harassment for several years\".\nHe added: \"Parliamentary committees have now twice found the vigour of their enforcement to be disappointing. It's now vital the public are reassured they're on top of the problem - and not behind the curve.\"\nEHRC head John Kirkpatrick told the BBC's Today programme that the letter was a \"starting point\".\n\"If it's not proving successful, we can investigate further. If we can find legal robust evidence of breaches of the law then we can impose an action plan on them and if they don't follow that, a court can impose fines on them,\" he said.\n\"The most effective and efficient way to make progress is through agreements but if that's not progressing adequately that's when we can take stronger and further action.\"\nThe BBC first began investigating working conditions at McDonald's more than two years ago, after the fast-food chain signed its agreement with the EHRC.\nIn July 2023, we published our initial investigation, which reported claims by workers, some as young as 17, of being groped and harassed almost routinely.\nAt the time, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.\nSince then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.\nEarlier this year, we reported that the watchdog plans to intervene again, \"in light of serious allegations raised by our work with the company, and the BBC investigation\".\nThe BBC understands the action plan will involve strengthening the existing measures - which included providing more training and conducting a survey of workers - as well as announcing new steps.\nAlistair Macrow, the boss of McDonald's in the UK, has been summoned twice to Parliament to answer questions in front of MPs since our initial investigation.\nIn January, he said 29 people had been dismissed over sexual harassment allegations over the past 12 months.\nIn a statement, a McDonald's spokesperson said the agreement with the EHRC was signed \"with the intention that it continues to evolve to ensure the robust measures we have in place are aligned with any updated guidance\".\nIt said the letter was sent \"to remind our franchisees of their legal obligations to provide a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace for their employees - which is the same legal requirement of all employers,\" adding that it \"welcomes\" any steps that mean it is continuing to make progress in this area.\nIt said that together with its franchisees, it is committed to doing everything it can to ensure a safe working environment for all employees, with initiatives and measures as part of a cultural action plan.\n\"These actions include everything from enhanced training programmes and onboarding practices, through to the launch of a new digital speak up channel designed with our and our franchisees' restaurant crew in mind,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are confident that the plan we have in place is working and making a difference to the near 170,000 people currently employed by McDonald's and our franchisees across McDonald's in the UK & Ireland today.\"\nThey added that its latest anonymous employee survey showed that 94% of people are aware of ways in which they can speak up.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nSome of the names in this story have been changed to protect identities.\nGet our flagship daily newsletter delivered straight to your inbox first thing, with all the latest headlines you need to start the day.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has threatened a 200% tariff on any alcohol coming to the US from the European Union (EU) in the latest twist of an escalating trade war.\nThe threat is a response to the EU's plans for a 50% tax on imports of US-produced whiskey as part of its retaliation to Trump's tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US.\nThe US president called for the immediate removal of the EU's \"nasty\" tariff on US whiskey, calling the bloc \"hostile and abusive\" and \"formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States\".\nA European Commission spokesperson said that \"calls are being prepared\" between between the US and the EU to discuss the situation.\nIt confirmed that its trade commissioner, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, had \"reached out to his American counterparts\" after Trump's latest threat.\nThe stand-off marked another escalation of a trade war which has rattled financial markets and raised concerns over the impact on the economies and consumers in many countries around the world, including the US.\nEurope sends more than \u20ac4.5bn ($4.89bn; \u00a33.78bn) worth of wine each year to the US, which is its largest export market, according to the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins, which represents the European wine industry.\nIgnacio S\u00e1nchez Recarte, secretary-general of the group, said if Trump carried through on his threats, it would destroy the market, costing thousands of jobs.\n\"There is no alternative to sell all this wine,\" he said, pleading with the two sides to \"keep wine out of this fight\".\nThe latest clash came after new US tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on Wednesday, hitting imports of the metals with a blanket duty of 25% and ending exemptions from the duties that the US had previously granted for shipments from some countries, including from the EU and Canada.\nCanada and Europe - which are among America's biggest trade partners - called the new taxes unjustified and struck back with their own tariffs on a range of US products. The EU's measures are due to go into force 1 April. \nThe clash reprises a battle that played out during Trump's first term, when he first announced tariffs on steel and aluminium. \nThe EU responded with its own tariffs, including a 25% tax on American whiskey.\nIn the aftermath, whiskey sales to the EU dropped 20%, falling from roughly $552m in 2018 to $440m in 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the US. Trump in turn\nThe tariffs were lifted after Trump left office, after the two sides reached an agreement that exempted a certain amount of European metals from the duties.\nBut Trump has indicated little appetite for deal-making so far, at least when it comes to steel and aluminium.\n\"If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the US will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all wines, champagnes & alcoholic products coming out of France and other EU represented countries,\" he wrote on social media, using all capital letters for some of the message. \nThe targeting of wine and whiskey is symbolic - there are few consumer goods more iconic than French Bordeaux or Tennessee whiskey. From a value standpoint, drinks trade is worth less than some of the other items facing tariffs.\nBut Mary Taylor, a US-based importer of European wines, said the measures would be catastrophic for her business and industry, with an impact that would ripple out to restaurants, bars and distributors across the US. \n\"It just looks like a big, giant threat to our livelihoods,\"  she said.\nMs Taylor, who brings in 2 million bottles a year, weathered the 25% tariff Trump put on certain EU bottles during his first term by expanding her distribution in Europe, but she said, \"200% is a whole different ball game\".\nShares in the US fell again on Thursday. \nThe S&P 500 dropped nearly 1.4%, taking it down roughly 10% from its most recent peak - a milestone known as a correction. The Dow slumped 1.3%, while the Nasdaq dropped almost 2%. \nIn Europe, London's FTSE 100 was flat, while Germany's Dax ended about 0.5% lower. \nIn Paris, the Cac 40 fell 0.6%, as shares of major spirit-makers were hit, with Pernod Ricard down 4% and Hennessy cognac maker LVMH falling 1.1%.\nIn interviews with US business media on Thursday, White House officials blamed the EU for escalating the dispute.\n\"Why are Europeans picking on Kentucky bourbon or Harley-Davidson motorcycles? It's disrespectful,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television, describing the back-and-forth as \"off the topic\".\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that a trade war was likely to inflict more economic pain on the EU than on the US, dismissing concerns that the clash could spiral.\n\"One or two items, with one trading bloc \u2013 I'm not sure why that's a big deal for the markets,\" he said.\nIn an interview with the BBC's HardTalk, European central bank president Christine Lagarde, said that the EU had \"no choice\" but to retaliate.\n\"At the moment, everybody is positioning,\" she said, adding that she expected the two sides to sit down and negotiate.\n\"Everybody will suffer\" if the dispute were to develop into a full blown trade war, she warned.\nSo far, Trump has shown little tolerance for retaliation from countries over the tariffs he has introduced.\nEarlier this week, he blasted Canada with the threat of a 50% tariff on its steel and aluminium after the Canadian province of Ontario responded to new tariffs with a surcharge on electricity exports to the US.\nHe rescinded that threat after Ontario agreed to suspend the charges.\nFormer Trump adviser Stephen Moore, now an economist with the Heritage Foundation, said he thought the EU would have to make a concession to defuse the situation, noting that Trump had consistently voiced concerns about rules on agricultural products.\n\"Absolutely this is going to end up with a deal,\" he said. \"It's only a question if it ends up in a deal in a day, a week, a month or six months, but there will eventually be a negotiated settlement.\" \nThe full HARDtalk will be available from 14 March on the BBC News Channel, iPlayer, the World Service and as a podcast.",

The photo quickly went viral as it revealed the reality of Greenland's rapidly melting ice.\nIn June 2019, a striking image of husky dogs apparently walking on water in Greenland stunned the world and quickly went viral.\nThe photo was taken by Steffen Olsen, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute and lead of Blue Action, a European project which investigates the effect of a changing Arctic on weather and climate.\n\"The reaction surprised me,\" says Olsen. \"It surprised me that so many people saw this as a beautiful photo. I saw it as a scary situation.\"\nThat's because the dogs were in fact wading through ankle-deep meltwater on top of sea ice in Inglefield Bredning, an 80km-long (49.7 miles) system in northwestern Greenland.\n\"I learned to see the photo as an illusion. People don't see sea ice, but dogs walking on water,\" Olsen says.\u00a0\nOlsen captured the photo while travelling with a team of scientists who were monitoring sea and ice conditions near the town of Qaanaaq, one of the world's most northerly towns. They were retrieving scientific instruments they had deployed during the winter.\u00a0\n\"We had been travelling for some hours and it became clear that the melting was very extreme\u2026 [the ice] more or less melted beneath our feet while we were travelling on it,\" says Olsen. \"The local hunters and I were very surprised\u2026 we were searching for dry spots to get the dogs and the sleds out of the water and there were none in sight. We turned around and made it back to the coast.\"\nThe dogs are typically very hesitant to get their paws wet, says Olsen. \"Usually when we meet water, it's because there are cracks in the sea ice and the dogs have to jump over the water\u2026they hate it. But it was actually very warm so I think they were happy to have cold feet,\" he says, adding that temperatures reached 14C (57F) on the day.\nThe scientists managed to retrieve their instruments a few days later once the water had drained away through small cracks in the ice sheet. \"Then you have a short period of time when you can then travel again before the ice collapses and breaks up,\" says Olsen.\nOlsen says he was extremely surprised by the rapid melting he witnessed when he took the photo on 13 June 2019. He has only experienced such an extreme event once during his 15 years carrying out research in Greenland. It's unusual for melting to occur that quickly, Olsen explains.\n\"It requires a sudden onset of warm air while you still have fresh snow on the ice and solid sea ice. So it's an example of an extreme event developing early in the season... The local community have told me: 'you will have to wait 100 years to see [such an event] again'.\"\u00a0\nMelting events such as the one Olsen witnessed would normally not occur until later in the season, in late June and July, but in 2019 melting started in mid-April, around six to eight weeks before the 1981-2020 average, and affected roughly 95% of Greenland's ice sheet, according to the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nSuch early melting events can have a \"snowball effect\" and lead to more melting as there is less snow and ice to reflect the Sun's rays back into space and keep the surface cool, explains Bianca Perren, a paleoclimatologist at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who studies sediment cores from polar regions to understand the long-term variability of the climate.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Antarctica's upside-down ice-scape we had no idea existed\n\u2022\u00a0The 'mind bomb' photos that changed the whaling industry\n\u2022\u00a0Why polar bears are no longer the poster image of climate change\nGreenland experienced record ice loss in 2019, shedding a total of 532 billion tonnes from its giant ice sheet, according to a 2020 study. On average, Greenland loses 234 billion tonnes of ice per year\u00a0\u2013 enough to pack into 6,324 Empire State Buildings.\n\"2019 was a really unusually warm year, but so was 2012,\" says Kelly Hogan, a marine geophysicist at BAS who studies the impacts of Greenland's melting ice sheet. In 2012, the summer period (June-August) was more than 2C (4F) warmer than the average for 1981-2010, and more than 1.5C (3F) warmer for the entire ice sheet. \"Those extremes are coming round more frequently than we had thought they would. They're happening every few years,\" says Hogan.\n\"What's really distinctive about Greenland is how much melting you get on the surface in the summer, because you don't get anywhere near as much as that in Antarctica,\" says Hogan. \"When you see huge volumes of water [on the ice], it is really shocking.\"\nBut it's rare to see \"giant pools of water\" on the surface like in Olsen's photo, says Perren, as usually the water seeps through cracks in the ice. \"It basically pops the ice sheet up and floats it out to the coast. So often you don't have this pooling of water, but instead you have warm water that's being sent down into the bowels of the Greenland ice sheet, basically warming the whole thing,\" she says.\nThe rapid melting of the ice is already affecting local communities' way of life. \"They are having to adapt the way they hunt and fish,\" says Olsen.\nIf the ice is unsafe to travel on, it also makes it more difficult for scientists to carry out their research, Olsen adds. \"We will have to adapt and rely more on automatic instruments instead of community-based monitoring.\"\u00a0\nSafety is already a concern, says Perren, adding: \"I have promised my son that I will not step foot on the ice sheet because it's so dangerous.\"\nThe photo has helped raise awareness of Greenland's vulnerability to climate change, says Olsen. \"I have definitely found that you can get a lot of attention for the problem with a photo\u2026 so it has been very efficient.\n\"But I've also been challenged by people saying: 'how can you take a photo of climate change?' And I agree, you cannot take one photo and call it climate change, because that is something that unfolds over a longer time period,\" says Olsen. \"We need to explain the photo and provide the right context.\"\nPhotos are useful tools for starting conversation about the environment and explaining scientific phenomena, says Perren. \"Science has a communication problem,\" she says.\n\"When I first saw it in 2019 I remember thinking: 'oh my gosh, this is such a shocking image,'\" adds Perren. \"It's a symbolic image of what climate change looks like in Greenland. But there's also a scientific side to it: maybe this is unprecedented but it also [paints] a very good, kind of emblematic picture of what the future would look like.\"\nHogan says that photo \"really drives home the extent of the problem\". \"It looks like the dogs are skating on something without a bottom\u2026 it feels like they could just sink at any moment, which is maybe some sort of metaphor for the ice sheet and the future.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nEngland's powerful physicality 'obliterated' Wales\nThere was a moment, about 15 minutes in at the Principality Stadium, when you thought you knew what you were getting.\nA scrum collapsed. Tom Curry shoved Nicky Smith. Aaron Wainwright shoved Curry. Ollie Chessum shoved Wainwright.\nAnd finally a grinning Dafydd Jenkins grabbed a fistful of Chessum's shirt, pulling it up over the England lock's mouth like a parent dabbing at a toddler's grubby face.\nTit-for-tat, toe-to-toe, close quarters and tight margins.\nWales were 14 points down, but, having had a Blair Murray try chalked off, their chins were still up. They believed. They had been down by similar margins against Ireland and Scotland and carried the fight right back.\nAgainst England - the rivals against whom both history and enmity run deepest - it is always tight. \nOnly twice in the previous 11 Six Nations meetings at the Principality - Wales' wins in 2013 and 2021 - had the two teams been separated by more than 10 points. \nThis felt like a contest. Like it always does.\nAnd then, very quickly, it didn't.\nThis video can not be played\nEngland run in 10 tries in record-breaking win\nThree tries in the space of six minutes, just before the break, did the damage.\nTommy Freeman, Chandler Cunningham-South and Will Stuart crossed for 19 unanswered points and England trotted down the tunnel 33-7 up.\nThe match was done. The desecration, though, had only just begun.\nAs England pounded Wales to a powder in the second half, the life seeped out of Cardiff's sporting cathedral.\nDaffodils wilted, dragons drooped and decibels dropped to the quiet hubbub of a cricket crowd.\nEngland didn't care about that. \nAfter a run of narrow defeats at Twickenham in the autumn, they have felt pain aplenty on their home turf. \nThey exorcised those ghosts, pummelling away with gainline dominance and ambition out the back and out wide.\nThe numbers spelled it out.\nThis 68-14 win was the most points England have ever scored against Wales, surpassing the 62 they ran in in a 2007 Rugby World Cup warm-up.\nThe 54-point margin of victory was the biggest any team has managed against Wales in not just the Six Nations, but the tournament in its Five and Home Nations guises too - a history going back to 1883.\nA raft of novices set new benchmarks.\nTom Roebuck, physical in the tackle, a threat in the air, strong in contact, was superb on his first Test start. \nHis Sale team-mate Ben Curry, winning his 11th cap, was a dervish, winning turnovers and collisions alike. \nFin Smith is making the 10 shirt his own. Henry Pollock lived up to the hype, zipping past deflated Welsh defenders for two late scores.\nEstablished names also buffed up their Lions credentials.\nTommy Freeman thundered around in midfield to great effect, having been shifted in off the wing. Ellis Genge showed the heavy-duty carrying that some feared had gone out of his game. \nMaro Itoje's captaincy chops are in evidence, making a persuasive case to the referee for Murray's disallowed try. George Ford's passing picked more holes in a gaping Welsh defence towards the end.\nTen-try England rout Wales but title bid falls short\nWelsh rugby reaches record low as England run riot \nEngland celebrate 'special' win as Wales suffer 'dark day'  - reaction & clips\nEngland's boss was more than happy.\n\"I wanted the players to play big and fast, aggressive with the ball and that's exactly what they did,\" said head coach Steve Borthwick.\n\"That's a sign that this young team just embraces challenges and it is growing and developing fast.\n\"We were just falling short before of getting those actual wins but the team has stuck to the process.\"\nThis Wales team - a pale imitation of the giants of the past - helped England look good. But a campaign featuring four wins from five games, reportedly the expectation the Rugby Football Union had set for Borthwick, doesn't offer much scope for criticism.\nEngland undoubtedly got lucky at times.\nThey lacked dimensions at others, reverting too often to the boot.\nBut a tour to Argentina and the United States this summer, where the absence of Lions tourists will open up space to blood more youngsters, is a great chance to carry some momentum and develop tactics and players.\nHaving ransacked the Principality, England were briefly set to return for a victory lap.\nWith Scotland only three points adrift at half-time in Paris, having had a try chalked off on the final play before the interval, it seemed like France might cough up the Six Nations trophy.\nA replica awaited in the bowels of Wales' stadium to be handed over to England in a ceremony behind closed doors, but in front of the television cameras.\nAs it was, Les Bleus ran away with the game at the Stade de France and England's bus into town headed instead for a more private city-centre celebration.\nIt will be more than six months until England are back together at full strength. \nBut the memories of turning a fortress into a funhouse in Cardiff will last far longer - and fuel them to further feats.\nThis video can not be played\nIt's a privilege to coach England - Borthwick",

        "article_text": "Sweet, tangy and packed with probiotics, gira has long been a go-to winter tonic \u2013 and is now making a comeback in craft breweries and kombucha-style artisanal brands.\nWhen Tadas Eidukevi\u010dius was crafting his latest winter menu at Demoloftas in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Michelin-starred chef turned to an unassuming staple: the turnip. But rather than deconstructing the simple ingredient beyond recognition, Eidukevi\u010diusd slow-roasted and lightly smoked the root vegetable before serving it with gira, Lithuania's traditional fermented beverage.\n\"I wanted to create a dish that highlights the traditions of Lithuania on a plate, and using gira to make the glaze brought so many flavours together without over-complicating things \u2013 it was a no brainer,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius. \"The gira adds acid, sweetness and a pleasant tang, which gives more complexity to the otherwise simple vegetable.\"\nWhile Eidukevi\u010dius' creative approach no doubt helped capture the attention of Michelin inspectors, gira remains largely absent from Lithuania's fine-dining scene. Instead, the naturally fermented drink is a household staple, enjoyed chilled in summer or as a soothing remedy for a sore throat. Once brewed in homes out of necessity \u2013 particularly during Soviet times when things were scarce \u2013 in recent years, its increased popularity has led it to be mass produced and sold by the can in soft-drink aisles of supermarkets and corner shops throughout the country.\nDating back to ancient times, gira is more commonly known as kvass across north-eastern Europe where it can be made with grains, fruits or vegetables, and is widely popular in Baltic and Slavic countries where fermentation traditions run deep.\n\"Traditionally, [in Lithuania] it was a homemade drink using old rye bread because it was a smart way to use up leftovers,\" says Tomas Josas, a beer historian and 2023 beer sommelier champion of Lithuania who grew up drinking his grandparents' homebrewed gira. \"Fermentation not only preserved nutrients but also lowered the pH, killing harmful bacteria \u2013 meaning kvass was often safer to drink than water.\"\nA traditional recipe involves soaking toasted or dried-out rye bread in hot water to extract the flavour. Once cooled, yeast and maybe sugar in the form of raisins are added to kickstart the natural fermentation process. It is then cooled, strained and bottled, to be consumed within three to five days. The result is a slightly tart, mildly effervescent drink with an ABV of up to 1.2%, akin to traditionally brewed kombucha, and contains healthy probiotics that benefit gut health and immunity. In Lithuania, traditionalists see it as a tonic for the common cold because it can be made with honey, ginger and other herbs as an immunity booster.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n\"When I was little, my grandmother would make gira for Easter and Christmas as a festive drink but I also remember drinking gira when I was sick \u2013 consuming it more commonly as a natural remedy,\" explained Ieva \u0160idlait\u0117, a cultural historian and the author of Naturally Fermented\u00a0who teaches fermentation classes on her farm outside Vilnius. \"In the 20th Century, when sugar was available to everyone, it became sweet,\" she added. \"Before this time, it was completely fermented and a sour liquid without any bubbles. It was mostly used to acidify food, make soups and also sauces because in our culture, food is dominated by a sour taste.\"\nJosas agrees. \"Many believed kvass was good for digestion and immunity, thanks to its probiotics. My great-grandparents made traditional homebrewed gira, very different from today's commercial versions [that are sweeter]. It had a funky, tangy flavor from lactobacillus \u2013 like sauerkraut has, but in liquid form. I wasn't a fan as a child since it lacked sugar, but once I got into beer, I learned to love its complexity,\" he says.\nThe early '80s is what Josas describes as \"the golden age of gira\" with mobile barrels selling it on every street corner during summer. However as global soft drinks like Coke flooded the Baltic market, gira struggled to compete, losing its appeal and audience. To survive, manufacturers began mass-producing the drink using sugar for appeal and cheap malt extract to speed up the process, shifting it closer to soda than traditional fermentation.\n\"Kvass lacks a strong identity, a clear drinking culture or an image that appeals to younger generations,\" says Josas, noting that while gira shares the same probiotic qualities of kombucha, it has never been \"hyped\" as a health drink. But things are changing, he says. Artisanal gira brands are reviving traditional methods, tapping into kombucha's success.\u00a0\nOne of Lithuania's largest producers of beer and gira is Gubernija Brewery in northern Lithuania who, despite their large-scale production, still make their gira traditionally: with black grain bread. However, the 360-year-old brewery is also adapting for modern palates.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Japan's ancient fermented 'superdrink'\n\u2022\u00a0The national park that draws mushroom hunters from around the world\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\u00a0\n\"We have created different varieties of kvass to widen our audience in the last few years,\" says Jogail\u0117 \u010coj\u016bt\u0117, export specialist for Gubernija Brewery. \"For example, our white wheat bread gira is aimed at younger consumers who like trendy soft drinks. The taste is much milder. Another popular item we have is the dark rye bread gira with hemp and hints of lime; it is a unique and refreshing twist to our traditional recipe and proves that gira really can stand the test of time.\"\n\"In 2024, we observed an 18% increase in the sales volume of owned gira brands compared to the previous year,\" she continues, \"while export sales volume grew by 47%.\"\nGlobally, interest in non-alcoholic beverages and low-ABV drinks is soaring, and kvass is catching on. In the US, breweries, bakeries and even restaurants have released their own versions of kvass with great success. Dan Woods of Beaver Brewing Company in Pennsylvania produces kvass in his nanobrewery; while at Honey's in East Williamsburg in New York, kvass made an appearance on tap. Made with chunks of toasted dark sourdough rye bread which were left to ferment, the slightly tart drink was sweetened with a touch of honey and also served as a cocktail.\nWhere to try Gira\nIn Vilnius, traditional restaurants like Lokys have kvass on the menu; it pairs incredibly well with a plate of smoked cold cuts. Elsewhere around the city, small batch gira made traditionally with bread can be found in health food shops as well as popular city bakery Kmynin\u0117, which uses its leftover sourdough rye.\nIn Australia, a string of bakeries have collaborated with local craft breweries to make stronger alcoholic versions, such as Three Mills Bakery in the nation\u2019s capital, Canberra; while in Leeds in the UK, Northern Monk releases a seasonal kvass each year.\nWhile some international versions exceed 4% ABV, for Lithuanians, it remains a drink with cultural significance that should only be fermented to 1.2% ABV at most. \"It should not be considered a direct substitute for beer,\" says \u010coj\u016bt\u0117.\nInstead, Eidukevi\u010dius says, the beauty of the unassuming drink lends itself to a nice refresher anytime of the day with its sweet, acidic, tangy and even funky taste.\n\"Gira, for all its refreshing qualities, can be a bit of a mischievous drink,\" Eidukevi\u010dius adds. \"There's a running joke in Lithuanian households about 'gira explosions' because it ferments in closed containers where enormous pressure can build up like a bottle of Champagne. There's nothing quite like walking into a cellar and finding gira sprayed across the walls and ceiling like some kind of fizzy, rye-bread-scented geyser. It's a testament to how alive this drink is. It's a reminder that we're working with natural processes, and sometimes, those processes have a mind of their own.\"\nSo, if you find yourself in Lithuania looking for a low-alcohol beverage, consider a glass of gira. \"Drinking gira is a connection to our land and to the traditions that have shaped Lithuania's culture,\" says Eidukevi\u010dius.\"It has a long tradition in my beautiful country as more than just a beverage; it's a part of our cultural heritage and a link to our ancestors' traditions.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

We get one slightly in our favour and there's national headlines for a week.\"\nHe was seemingly referring to a decision in Bergvall's favour against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg, when the midfielder avoided a second yellow card.\n\"Things go against us and there's not even a sentence on it,\" Postecoglou added.\nPostecoglou brought off the struggling Yves Bissouma and Brennan Johnson at half-time against Fulham and sent on Bergvall and Son Heung-min.\nThe Spurs boss confirmed Bissouma was taken off due to his poor performance, saying: \"I just feel Biss can sometimes let the game drift by him.\n\"He needs to be a little bit more dominant in the way he gets on the ball. At times I think the game gets away from him and today we needed more in that position.\n\"I needed him to play though, because he hasn't played a lot. At the same time you've got to perform. It's fair to say, Biss and a few others are probably lacking a bit of confidence.\n\"That's affecting him, but we're at the point of the season now where we need guys to get out there and put those things to one side and perform.\"\nPostecoglou added: \"It's not about getting through to him or a lack of effort.\n\"I just think with players sometimes they go through these spells and he needs to find a way to break through that and we need to find a way to get that out of him.\"\nIt is becoming implausible for 13th-placed Spurs to qualify for Europe through the Premier League after taking just 10 points from their past 10 games.\nHowever, Spurs would qualify for the Champions League if they were to win the Europa League, and they moved a step nearer that goal by knocking out AZ Alkmaar on Thursday to reach the quarter-finals.\nPostecoglou, who has faced heavy criticism for this season's domestic failings, is clear that Spurs must not throw away their last remaining nine Premier League matches.\n\"I said to the players I'm not going to allow anyone to think about Europa and nothing else,\" he said.\n\"We can't let this league season go the way it has.

        "article_text": "As leaders around the world try to figure out how best to deal with the new Trump administration, one Canadian official has come out swinging.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, a regular on major US networks where he has addressed Americans directly, was among the first in Canada to pull US alcohol off the shelves as a trade war between the two neighbours ramped up.\nFord has also ripped up a multi-million dollar contract with Elon Musk's Starlink, and has been unafraid to use energy exports to the US as a bargaining chip - all in a bid to get Trump to withdraw his tariff threats against Canada.\nThe right-wing, plain-spoken politician admitted he was initially delighted Donald Trump won re-election and viewed him as an ally.\nBut then, Ford said, using an expletive, the US president pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\".\nThis week, it appeared that Ford's unusual tactics had grabbed Trump's attention.\nSpeaking to reporters on the White House lawn on Tuesday, the US president described Ford as a \"very strong man\" as he addressed Ontario's threat to slap a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity.\nFord has since shelved that plan pending further discussions with the Trump administration. But his threat to hike the price of electricity on Americans seems to have earned him a grudging nod of respect from Trump, who later backed off from doubling tariffs on aluminium and steel to 50%.\nIt also helped Ford score a meeting with US officials in Washington to discuss the future of the Canada-US trade relationship. \nFord sat on Thursday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The meeting was also attended by Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc.\nThe meeting was \"very, very productive\" though \"bumps in the road\" remain, he said afterwards. \nIt is unclear whether Ford's defiant stance will earn Canada more favours from Trump. It is also an approach that is not unanimously agreed on, with Premier Danielle Smith of the oil-rich Alberta vehemently refusing to withhold any of her province's energy exports to the US.\nTrump's recent willingness to turn down the heat, however, signals that Ford may be succeeding in grabbing the attention of the US, said Shakir Chambers, a Canadian Conservative strategist at the Toronto-based Oyster Group.\n\"That's how you deal with Trump, through a position of strength,\" Mr Chambers told the BBC. \"Ford understands the language of Trump's people and inner circle.\"\nIt at least earned him a rare compliment from the US president, who for several months has berated Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau repeatedly by calling him \"governor,\" while expressing his desire to absorb Canada and make it \"the 51st state\".\nAlso rare is seeing the Oval Office pay attention to the premier of a Canadian province, whose day-to-day is ordinarily preoccupied with domestic matters such as infrastructure projects, healthcare funding and co-operating with the federal government.\nBut these are no ordinary times in Canada. The country is in the middle of a transfer of power, from outgoing Trudeau to Prime Minister-designate Mark Carney.\nIt is also facing what has been referred to as an \"existential threat\" from its neighbour and long-time ally to the south.\nAnnouncing his intention to pause energy tariffs pending trade talks, Ford vowed to Canadians that he will not \"roll over\" and warned that using Ontario's energy supply as a bargaining chip remains on the table. \nBut he said he will not ignore the chance to resolve this dispute with Americans.\nHis emergence as the face of Canada's fight is, in many ways, understandable. As Ontario premier, he is at the helm of a province that is home to 16 million people and Canada's large auto manufacturing sector, which is deeply intertwined with that of the US, leaving it vulnerable to any broad tariff threats.\nHe is also chair of the Council of the Federation, a multilateral congress that includes all of Canada's provincial and territorial premiers.\nOn Wednesday, Ford kept busy ahead of his meeting with the Americans. He sat down for breakfast with incoming Prime Minister Carney, where the two discussed the need to \"stand firm and strong\" to Trump.\nAmericans will undoubtedly see more of Ford in the coming weeks and months. The premier just decisively secured four more years in office after campaigning on standing up against the US president.\nFor Ontarians, Ford is a well-known figure. He has led the province since 2018 and is only the second premier in its history to secure three consecutive majority government wins.\nHe is the product of a Toronto political dynasty known as \"Ford Nation\". For many years, he was overshadowed by his younger brother, the late Rob Ford, who was the mayor of Toronto from 2010 to 2014 before he was ousted after a crack cocaine scandal.\nLocally, the Fords are infamous for their \"authentic\" and approachable style of politics, said Mr Chambers, who was coached high school football by the younger Ford.\nPremier Ford is known for handing out his personal cell phone number to constituents, encouraging them to contact him directly. During a news conference on US tariffs last week, he urged people to be patient as he worked to respond to more than 4,000 text messages he has received lately.\nDespite his popularity, the premier is also embroiled in several controversies. Chief among them is an ongoing police investigation into a now-scrapped deal his government made that would have allowed the development of environmentally-protected land.\nOn the national stage, he has run up against Alberta Premier Smith, who has called for a more measured and cautious response to Trump and his tariffs. \nThat caution has also been practised by other leaders, namely France's Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, both of whom struck a more diplomatic tone in their February visits to the White House. \nBut Ford's defiant stance against Trump is widely supported in Canada. Polls show the majority of Canadians support retaliating against the US, and a swell of nationalism has since emerged across the country.\nWhile Ford has been forceful, he has also been careful in his direct appeals to Americans.\n\"Believe me when I say I don't want to do this,\" he said earlier this week when he announced his plan to hike electricity prices, before underscoring that his priority is to protect Ontario jobs.",

        "article_text": "To celebrate World Sleep Day, here's our science-based guide to getting the best slumber you can \u2013 from varying sleep with the seasons to taking inspiration from the past.\nIt's a typical weekday morning, and you're just beginning to stir in bed. There's light streaking through the windows, while the many chirps and caws of birds announce that it's probably time to get up\u2026 but surely that can't be right? Cue the familiar feeling of dread, as you remember a night filled with restless, low-quality sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\nAcross the world, people are struggling with insufficient sleep. In the US alone, it's been estimated that between 50 and 70 million people suffer from the affliction, and on a global scale, it has even been called an epidemic. However, there are some simple adjustments \u2013 both psychological and physical \u2013 that might help to improve the quality of your sleep. Here's our guide to having a delicious, restful slumber, inspired by the latest scientific research and some long-forgotten historical tricks.\u00a0\u00a0\nToday, when people wake up in the middle of the night, it's not unusual to panic \u2013 after all, we tend to believe that we should sleep for a continuous eight hours. But this has not always been the case. For millennia, people had a short first sleep \u2013 and then they woke up. These little slumber-gaps were filled with an endless variety of activities, from household chores to gossip in the dark (and even the occasional murder). Then after a couple of hours, people went back to bed and slept through until the morning.\u00a0\nThis is the forgotten ancient practise of \"two sleeps\". It was rediscovered by Roger Ekirch, a university distinguished professor of history at Virginia Tech, Virginia, in the 1990s. He believes that an awareness of the habit's historical prevalence might help to reframe the experiences of those who suffer from insomnia today \u2013 and perhaps lessen their anxiety about waking up in the night. Read more about the lost ancient habit of \"biphasic sleep\" in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs spring arrives, you might notice that you need less sleep and are finding it easier to leave your bed in the morning. Research shows that we need more sleep during the dark, cold winter months than we do during the summer. This is because humans experience seasonal sleep. According to one German study, people experienced both longer REM and deep sleep in December than in June. REM sleep is the most active stage of sleep, when we dream and our heart rate increases, while deep sleep is when the body repairs muscle and tissues and is important for the consolidation of long-term memory.\u00a0Read more about the seasonality of human sleep in this article by Isabelle Gerretsen.\u00a0\nIn many countries having a catnap is a daily ritual, and research shows that regular naps are good for our health. According to a 2023 study, habitual napping helps keep our brains bigger for longer and can delay brain ageing by between three to six years. A smaller brain volume has been linked to diseases such as Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.\nThere are also short-term benefits. Short naps, lasting no longer than 15 minutes, can immediately improve how well we perform mentally, with results lasting up to three hours after we wake up. The key to power naps is to keep them short (after 20 minutes we start drifting into deep sleep) and to make sure you have one mid-afternoon so that it doesn't disrupt your sleep at night. Read more about the health benefits of napping here.\u00a0\nBut not all naps are good for us. Some last mere seconds and these microsleeps can result in serious harm if they occur when you're driving. Analysis of dashcam footage from 52 drivers from a single truck company in Japan found that three quarters of them showed signs of microsleep before they were involved in a collision.\nMicrosleeps are more common among people who suffer from narcolepsy or people who don't get enough sleep at night. One study found that when people slept for just six hours a night for 14 days in a row, they had as many microsleeps as those who missed a whole night's sleep. If you're regularly experiencing microsleeps, it's therefore probably a sign that you're not getting enough sleep generally.\u00a0Read more about the naps that only last a few seconds in this article by Claudia Hammond.\u00a0\nAs we snuggle up in bed for the night \u2013 particularly if it's just with a good podcast \u2013 we might wonder why it's so cold under the covers, or even a bit lonely.\nHistorically, having your own bed was highly unusual. Like it or not, most people had to share \u2013 and not just with their siblings in childhood, or as a married couple. Until the 19th Century, the majority of people would have slept communally, routinely slumbering alongside friends, colleagues and even total strangers. A good bedfellow would provide warmth and conversation into the early hours of the morning \u2013 though you might have to overlook their morning breath and contribution to a bedful of biting parasites. Read more about the forgotten habit of communal sleep in this article by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nHow much sleep we all need can vary from person to person, with most recommendations for between seven and nine hours. But the amount of sleep you get is only one part of the equation. Quality matters as much, if not more.\nMost of us will have experienced feeling less refreshed after a night of tossing and turning. That's partly because when we sleep, our brains flood with cerebrospinal fluid to clear out accumulated debris and toxins. This waste-clearance system is called the glymphatic system, which works best at the same time every day. This means that when we get our shuteye is important. Syncing sleep with our natural circadian rhythms \u2013 the brain's 24-hour internal clock that regulates the cycle of alertness and sleepiness \u2013 gives rise to the best-quality rest.\u00a0Read more about the importance of sleep quality in this feature by Sandy Ong.\u00a0\nToday most people in the Western world are lucky enough to wake up on a soft bed, perhaps with a spring mattress or memory foam. However, things have not always been so comfortable.\u00a0\nIn the medieval era, many people opened their eyes each morning to stuffy air and pitch-blackness \u2013 the conditions inside a \"box bed\". These popular sleeping-cupboards were completely enclosed, and helped to keep people warm at night, though they were sometimes not much bigger than a wardrobe. Slightly later there came the \"tick\" mattress, a bag of cheap materials such as straw or leaves. Unfortunately, they also provided the ideal hiding place for ticks, fleas and bedbugs. But the true inventors of a bad night's sleep might arguably have been the Victorians, who created a variety of unpleasant solutions for homeless people, from rows of coffin-beds to a rope to hang oneself over for a rest. Read more about the curious history of beds through the centuries, or top up your knowledge on why medieval people slept in cupboards, in these articles by Zaria Gorvett.\u00a0\nSo, find yourself some bedfellows, allow for more sleep in the winter, and if you occasionally wake up in the night, consider yourself a modern pioneer of the lost ancient habit of biphasic sleep. We still can't promise that you'll be leaping out of bed on a Monday morning, but it's a start.\u00a0\n--\nThis story was originally published on 15/03/2024.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.",
