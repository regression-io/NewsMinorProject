        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer.\nThe controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages.\n\"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\"\nWhite House officials have played down the reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it.\nTrump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary.\n\"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media. That's an old one. Try finding something new,\" he said. \nTrump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea that was also floated by Hegseth himself earlier Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".\nHegseth did not directly respond to the story about the second Signal chat, which was initially reported by the New York Times.\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.\nThe messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nOfficials used the group to discuss information relating to upcoming strikes in Yemen. Goldberg left the original chat after the first attacks on 14 March, but the two group chats appeared to discuss the same military operation that took place over several weeks.\nThe White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, although critics of Hegseth - including former US defence officials - question that. They say discussing such information in Signal groups could jeopardise US personnel carrying out military operations.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only the sender of the message and its recipients can view its contents. \nThis is considered a high level of security for a messaging app. But it offers no protection if someone's phone is viewed by another person or falls into the wrong hands, or if the wrong person is added to a group chat.\nExperts say this is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on officials' private devices.\nThe existence of the second Signal group is the latest controversy surrounding the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth denounced the reporters, and said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\" before turning away from the cameras. \nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, a former top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, accused the \"Trump-hating media\" of \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nThe Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nUS air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The Houthi-led government said the attack constituted a \"war crime\".",

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

        "summary": "- KateMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.The stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.This is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.However, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.This was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.Of course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.This is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.Some people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. \"So Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.Why can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. \"Verstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".The guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option.",

        "article_text": "He had tea with the Queen, was blessed by the Pope and spread Hawaiian culture across the globe. More than a century later, a festival dubbed the \"Olympics of hula\" honours his legacy.\nSilence engulfed the audience at Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, Hawai'i, as a group of hula dancers appeared on stage. They moved gracefully in unison, rhythmically depicting a scene of an ancient Hawaiian myth as they bellowed \nmele\n (chants). The hula performance, which was part of the annual \nMerrie Monarch Festival\n, wasn't a mere spectacle; it was a powerful celebration of Hawaiian culture \u2013 and for years, it was banned.\nThe week-long Merrie Monarch Festival (which takes place 20-26 April 2025 and is celebrating its 62nd anniversary) has been called the \"\nOlympics of hula\n\" and perpetuates the sacred, centuries-old practice of dancing and chanting that preserves and portrays our native Hawaiian language, history, religion and culture. Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 best \nh\u0101lau\n (hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.\n\"It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,\" said K\u016b Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. \"And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King Kal\u0101kaua.\"\nFondly dubbed \"The Merrie Monarch\", King David La'amea Kal\u0101kaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislature\u00a0decided to elect a native\u00a0ali'i\u00a0(noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and Kal\u0101kaua took the oath of office the following day.\nBy the time of Kal\u0101kaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed \"vile heathen chants\".\nKal\u0101kaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the motto Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0(Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians \u2013 all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As Kal\u0101kaua famously proclaimed: \"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\"\u00a0\nTo many people around the world, \"hula\" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians \u2013 an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.\nAs part of Kal\u0101kaua's Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and l\u016b'au \u2013\u00a0all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later, \nho'opa'a \n(chanters) and \n'\u014dlapa \n(dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity Kal\u0101kaua revived.\n\"[Kal\u0101kaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,\" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have the \nKumulipo\n (a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, Kal\u0101kaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the \"Merrie Monarch\" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring by\u00a0spending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.\nDuring Kal\u0101kaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds of\u00a0Hawai'i Pono'\u012b\u00a0(the Kingdom's national anthem, which Kal\u0101kaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, Kal\u0101kaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.\u00a0'Iolani Palace\u00a0(which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights \u2013 five years before the White House did.\n\"He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],\" said Kenneth \"Aloha\" Victor, a kumu hula (master hula teacher) and designer of Kaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, Kal\u0101kaua maintained consulates and legations in more than 130 cities across the globe. The Kingdom had 13 consulates in Great Britain alone.\nBack at home, during an era of increased literacy, Kal\u0101kaua met with traditional na kahuna (priests) and na kapuna (elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book, Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The word embodying the spirit of Hawai'i\n\u2022 A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\nKal\u0101kaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of the Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art.\u00a0More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands: Princess Abigail Kaw\u0101nanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.\nA multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, Kal\u0101kaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be found hosting royal l\u016b'aus\u00a0for foreign dignitaries and heads of state.\nFor Hawaiians today, Kal\u0101kaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. \"When Kal\u0101kaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,\" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. \"It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.\"\nFor those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. \"Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,\" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.\nOf course, Kal\u0101kaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, l\u016b'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world. Visitors can experience this first hand at O'ahu's Polynesian Cultural Center, which hosts a traditional Hawaiian l\u016b'au paying homage to Queen Lili'uokalani (Kal\u0101kaua's sister, who succeeded him until white businessmen\u00a0overthrew the Kingdom in 1893), while the Queen Emma Summer Palace\u00a0in Honolulu offers contemporary hula lessons for adults.\nOn Maui, immersive experiences at the\u00a0Grand Wailea\u00a0include an E Ala E\u00a0oli\u00a0(chant) in the mornings on the beach, while interactive language lessons teach guests how to pronounce words in\u00a0\u02bb\u014clelo Hawai'i\u00a0(Hawaiian). Beachside resorts like\u00a0Outrigger Reef in Waikiki Beach are adopting a regenerative tourism approach at its A'o Cultural Center by allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and \u2013 yes \u2013 participate in hula lessons.\n\"It all spawns back to [King Kal\u0101kaua's] creed,\" said Victor. \"That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.\"\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story stated that\u00a0US sugar planters overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

I think I was 3-0 up and then I didn't pot a ball for three or four frames. Some of the balls he potted were incredible,\" Williams told BBC Sport. \n\"He's got the potential to win this tournament, there's absolutely no question. His long-potting was unbelievable and I just had to go back to my old break-off because every single time he potted a long red.\n\"I thought that I had to do something because I can't outscore him or outpot him, but I could still try to outwit him I suppose. I got stronger towards the end. \n\"When I nicked the frame to go 8-8, I potted a couple of long ones and then made a frame-winning break in the last frame, I actually felt quite good.\"\nIt was a superb performance from Williams in his 70th match at the sport's most famous venue. Booked in for surgery in June, he has been dogged by eyesight issues in the build-up to the tournament and has been dismissive of his own prospects.\nAt varying stages he was outplayed by Wu, who scored 1,022 points to his 838 - but whenever he appeared to be in difficulty, he found an answer.\nThe world number six will face Barry Hawkins or Hossein Vafaei next, with their contest set to conclude on Sunday evening (19:00 BST).\nIn Sunday afternoon's other first-round match, world number eight Mark Allen was 3-0 behind against Fan Zhengyi of China but then won five of the following six frames to take a 5-4 lead into Monday's second session.\nNorthern Ireland's Allen, 39, is aiming to complete the full set of snooker's Triple Crown events, having won the 2018 Masters and 2022 UK Championship.\nWatch Sunday's matches at the Crucible\nCrucible curse?

It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.5% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nThough the dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the Euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022. \nInterest rates on US government debt also rose, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries. \nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough,\".\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.",

The president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.The S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. \"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.Trump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.5% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.Though the dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. Trump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him.",

        "article_text": "The \"Blue Marble\" was the first photograph of the whole Earth and the only one ever taken by a human. Fifty years on, new images of the planet reveal visible changes to the Earth's surface.\n\"I'll tell you,\" said astronaut Harrison Schmitt as the Apollo 17 hurtled towards the Moon, \"if there ever was a fragile-appearing piece of blue in space, it's the Earth right now\".\nIt was Thursday 7 December 1972, that humanity got its first look at our planet as a whole. In that moment, the photograph \"The Blue Marble\" was taken \u2013 one which changed the way we saw our world.\n\"I can see the lights of southern California, Bob,\" said Schmitt to ground control about one and a half hours into the flight. \"Man's field of stars on the Earth is competing with the heavens.\"\nThe crew of the Apollo 17 \u2013 commander Eugene Cernan, command module pilot Ronald Evans and lunar module pilot Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt \u2013 were watching their home recede into the distance as they journeyed into space for the last manned mission to the Moon.\nLooking back towards the Earth, Cernan commented: \"the clouds seem to be very artistic, very picturesque. Some in clockwise rotating fashion\u2026 but appear to be\u2026 very thin where you can\u2026 see through those clouds to the blue water below.\"\nIt is an enduring image of the beauty but also the vulnerability of our planet \u2013 adrift as it is in the vastness of the Universe, which hosts no other signs of life that we have been able to detect to date. But ours is also a planet of great change. The tectonic movements that shift the landmasses move too slow for our eyes to notice. Yet another force \u2013 humanity itself \u2013 has been reshaping our planet at a pace that we can see. Urbanisation, deforestation, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are altering the way the Earth looks. So how, over the 50 years since that iconic image was taken, has the Blue Marble changed?\nThose first images of the Blue Marble were taken by the crew, who passed the onboard camera \u2013 a hand-held analogue Hasselblad 500 EL loaded with 70mm Kodak film \u2013 between them, captivated by the sight of the Earth from space.\n\"All the images captured with Hasselblads are spectacularly clear and bright,\" says Jennifer Levasseur, curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.\u00a0\nThe camera was specially modified for use in space, she adds. Glues, lubricants, moving parts and batteries could all cause problems or fail when exposed to the extremes of hot and cold in space. It was also given a large square shutter-release button so the crew could use it while wearing their cumbersome spacesuits.\n\"The other major modification, was the removal of the viewing screen \u2013 because it's extra glass,\" Levasseur says, The astronauts, \"had to learn how to take pictures without being able to see anything\", she says. \"Without a viewfinder, you can't see what you're taking.\"\nTaking photos, says Levasseur, was planned meticulously and written into the mission plan. \"They had known previous launches wouldn't give them whole Earth, but on this one the whole Earth would be entirely illuminated by the light of the Sun.\"\u00a0\nIt was around five hours and 20 minutes into the flight that the crew got their first glimpse of the entire planet. The crew were starting to get ready for bed, zipping into their sleeping bags. It was their first moment of downtime since the launch.\u00a0\n\"I suppose we're seeing as 100% full Earth as we'll ever see,\" said Cernan. \"Bob, it's these kind of views that stick with you forever\u2026 There's no strings holding it up either. It's out there all by itself.\"\u00a0\nThe Blue Marble image was captured at around\u00a029,000km (18,000 miles)\u00a0from Earth, as the Sun lit up the globe from behind the Apollo 17.\nAlmost six hours into the flight, Schmitt laughed. \"The problem with looking at the Earth, particularly Antarctica, is it's too bright,\" he said, \"And so I'm using my sunglasses through the monocular\".\nBack home, it was nearing 05:00 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and ground control was quiet. \"I'm not keeping you awake, am I, Bob?\" asked Schmitt. \"Just keep talking. We're listening,\" came the voice from the capsule communicator. And so the conversation continued long into the flight, the crew describing the clouds drifting over the ocean and the continents of home.\nPrevious Apollo missions had snapped the Earth partly hidden by shadow. The hugely influential, Earthrise, for instance,\u00a0shows the planet as it rises behind the Moon. Up until this point, our view of home had been fragmented, with no real way to visualise the planet in its entirety. (Read more about how Earthrise sparked an environmental movement.)\nSuddenly, glowing in the light of the Sun, the Earth was revealed as a beautiful shining blue orb, full of life and alone in the vastness of space. As a result, the Blue Marble is thought to have had more influence on humanity than any other photograph in history.\u00a0\n\"If you can't see something, it's hard to visualise that it exists,\" says Nick Pepin, a climate scientist at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. \"I think all of us who have been brought up with that [image] from a young age probably find it difficult to imagine a time when we didn't know what the Earth looked like. This was the first time that we could actually look back from space and see our home \u2013 and people suddenly realised it was an amazing thing, but also a fixed system that we live on.\"\u00a0\nThe image offers a view of the Earth from the Mediterranean Sea area to the Antarctica South polar ice cap. Heavy cloud hangs over the Southern Hemisphere, and almost the entire coastline of Africa can be seen.\nNasa officially credits the image to the entire crew. We may never know which of them actually took it but today it is reported to be one of the most reproduced images of all time.\nAt 07.39 GMT on 7 December 2022 \u2013 50 years later to the minute since the original was taken \u2013 a new \"Blue Marble\" was\u00a0captured by a satellite orbiting a million miles away. This time, a set of 12 images taken 15 minutes apart, reveal noticeable changes to our planet's surface, the result of 50 years of global warming.\nIn the 50 years that separates these two snapshots in time, one of the most striking differences is the visible reduction in the size of the Antarctic ice sheet. \"You can see the shrinking cryosphere \u2013 the shrinking ice sheet and the loss of the snow,\" says Pepin says. This, he says, is a major indicator of climate change.\nThe Sahara Desert has also grown while the rainforest \"is retreating further south\", he adds. Research has shown that tree cover in the vast Sahel region that borders the Sahara Desert has been in significant decline. \"The dominant thing that you can see on the [new] image is deforestation and the loss of vegetation\", as the Earth's land cover switches from greenery to desert.\nThe pictures were taken by Nasa's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera\u00a0(Epic), which has been imaging the sunlit side of Earth between 13 and 22 times a day since 2015. The satellite sits at the first Lagrange point, a point of equilibrium between the Sun and Earth, a million miles from Earth.\nFrom mid-April to mid-October, one photograph is taken of the Earth roughly every hour, and for the rest of the year it takes an image every two hours, says Alexander Marshak, deputy project scientist for Nasa's Deep Space Climate Observatory (Dscovr) satellite mission, which the camera is carried aboard.\u00a0\n\"With respect to the Blue Marble, on the 50th anniversary, we decided to take the same images at 15 minute intervals. So, in 15\u00a0minutes [the Earth] rotates around maybe 100km (62 miles),\" says Marshak. And, thanks to advances in technology, he adds, \"we can see the same images, but with much better quality\", even from a million miles away.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 'Earthrise': The photo that sparked an environmental movement\n\u2022 Out of this world: 11 spacewalks that made history\n\u2022 What the planets aligning really means \n\"And we can see much more than that,\" Marshak adds. \"We take images in 10 wavelengths, from UV [ultraviolet] to near infrared. From these images we can retrieve the property of ozone, of clouds, of water. The height of clouds, the location of clouds. We can look at the property of aerosols, the size of particles, the amount of particles. We retrieve even the shape of ice crystals [in the clouds], using the Sun's glint. We can [see] whether they're horizontally or randomly oriented.\"\n\"We retrieve [data on] the amount of leaves on Earth, and not only that but also the amount of leaves that are directly illuminated by the Sun,\" says Marshak. This data, combined with observations of ocean surface colour, can allow researchers to determine the rate of all photosynthetic activity on Earth.\nThe Dscovr programme hasn't been running long enough to draw any definitive conclusions, says Marshak, but they are starting to gather data that will provide new insights into how the world is changing \u2013 such as changes in cloud cover and height, reflectivity, and vegetation cover.\nAmong the other changes that have occurred since that first image of the entire Earth 50 years ago is the amount of human development and activity on our planet's surface. Although not visible in these images of the daylight side of the Earth, other satellites monitor for lights visible on the dark side of our planet. These show dramatic expansions in the urban sprawl across the continents alongside the activity of shipping on the Earth's oceans. Wildfires also glow across large swathes of the land at night, doubling in frequency in just the past 20 years.\nBack in 1972, the Blue Marble prompted a mass-reconsideration of our place in the Universe. Astronauts viewing Earth from space have reported a profound feeling of awe, a sense of interconnectedness and environmental awareness, and of self-transcendence. This is called the \"overview effect\".\u00a0\nIn the utter vastness of space, the beauty of Earth can be overwhelming. This feeling of intense awe has been found to elicit a fundamental change in thinking, a kind of cognitive realignment also called the \"need for accommodation\", as the person attempts to this process new perceptual information.\n\"Gobsmackingly \u2013 just \u2013 wow\" is how Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, described her first view of the Earth from space. It was 1991 and the 27-year-old chemist had just launched from Kazakhstan, to begin her journey to the Soviet Mir space station.\n\"We had two windows on the Soyuz spacecraft,\" she says. \"The commander, who sits in the middle, doesn't get a window. But the research cosmonaut, which was my job, and the flight engineer \u2013 we both had one. I had the right seat and flight engineer had the left seat. As we were launching, the spacecraft tipped my side very slightly towards the Earth. Immediately, the light streamed through that window.\"\nSharman describes her view of the curvature of the Earth, the \"gorgeous blue seas\", white clouds, and black space above. The Earth, she says, appeared as if it had its own glow. \"The Sun was at quite a low angle, so it would reflect off the sea, and then back up to the clouds \u2013 and off the clouds underneath to the Earth. Then [the light] came up so it felt as though the Earth had its own light source.\"\nShe compares the colour to the \"ultramarine of renaissance paintings\". \"It's quite unlike the rest of nature. It's that brightness against the blackness of space, you just see the Earth as this great big gorgeous blue dot.\"\u00a0\nThen, as her eyes began to adjust to the darkness of space, the stars appeared in their billions. \"We know there are probably billions of stars just in one small section of the Milky Way, maybe even trillions. And we think maybe there could be up to a couple of trillion galaxies in the Universe. That [makes you] realise the insignificance of Earth.\"\nSharman experienced these conflicting thoughts all at once. \"Our atmosphere is so thin. How easily that whole top layer, where most of life is, could just be wiped away.\" But, conversely, she adds, \"Earth is not the focal point of the Universe.\"\nTo this day Sharman dreams of \"floating along inside one of the modules and stopping by a window, looking out with the other crew\". The experience of\u00a0viewing the Earth from space, she says, \"definitely changed my life's priorities\". \"The most important thing is the people. And of course, the environment and ecology that's required to keep this Earth going.\"\nThe overview effect, say experts, is long-lasting and more powerful than other instances of awe. For the first time, the Blue Marble gave all of humanity the chance to experience the phenomenon to some degree. In fact, research shows that you can experience the overview effect with both feet firmly on the ground.\nLike Earthrise, the Blue Marble image became an emblem of the environmental movement. It showed a planet requiring stewardship at the global scale.\nThe Blue Marble was used to illustrate the\u00a0Gaia hypothesis, developed in the 1960s and '70s, which proposes that Earth and its biological systems act as a huge single entity, that exists in a delicate state of balance. And, although controversial among scientists, the theory kickstarted a holistic approach to Earth Science.\nThe image became a symbol of unity, too, as for the first time we could see the Earth without any human-imagined boundaries that divide us as they do on maps. The Blue Marble was\u00a0adopted\u00a0by activist groups like Friends of the Earth and events like Earth Day. Prior to this, environmental campaign images had often focused on pollution or endangered species.\u00a0\nThe photograph appeared on\u00a0postage stamps, and in the opening sequence of former US vice president Al Gore's documentary,\u00a0An Inconvenient Truth, and inspired research into Earth systems with the establishment of climate research institutions such as the Max-Planck Institut, based in Munich, Germany.\nLooking at the 1972 and 2022 Blue Marble images side-by-side, Pepin describes the Earth's \"restless atmosphere\". Visible in both images, are clouds formed above the green areas of rainforest, demonstrating the inextricable link between the forests and the rain. \"If you look at [central] Africa, you can see that most of the cloud, particularly on the earlier [image] is quite spotty, that indicates thunderstorms. Whereas if you go further north, and look at the Sahara desert, you can see there are no clouds.\n\"When you look from above you see all the connections, the overall relationships between areas,\" says Pepin. \"For example, Kilimanjaro rises from grassland, with snow on top. If you lived on the slopes you might not know there was snow on top and the importance of the connection between those areas.\"\nLooking at the Earth from space like this, he says, \"makes you appreciate the interlinkages between different parts of the ecosystems\". \"If you can only see your bit, you might think that environmental problems are only happening somewhere else and assume that 'it's not my problem',\" says Pepin.\u00a0\nHowever, the limitation, he says, is scale. \"You lose the detail. You need both. You need ground truthing [validating the information in the field] too.\"\nThere is a \"huge fundamental difference\" between these two images though, says Levasseur. \"One is captured by a human \u2013 and one is not. It doesn't have the same impact. And that's really because of the fact that there's no person there.\"\nLevasseur is looking forward to the photographs that will be brought home from the next manned mission to go as far as the Moon: Artemis II, planned for 2026. \"There's not going to be another whole Earth image in the way I think of it until humans go out away from Earth again. I wasn't alive in 1972. This is going to be a huge moment to know that people are looking at us from that far away.\"\n\"As much as we like to think of satellites as sort of our surrogates,\" she says, \"I know that there is a person behind that camera, so there is something different about it, and there always will be.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Trading cryptocurrency was just a bit of fun for Tzoni Raykov, but losing $1,500 worth to an administrative error has left him with serious concerns about his treatment by the industry.\nThe oil engineer has held an account with Revolut for several years - using its app to split bills with friends after going out for dinner or drinks. They would pay each other using traditional currency, like the pound sterling or US dollar.\nBut after seeing the e-money firm advertise its cryptocurrency services, he decided to give it a try.\nWhat Tzoni thought would be a straightforward transfer of cryptocurrency coins has left the Bulgarian national angry and out of pocket.\nHis experience highlights some of the frustrations people have had using cryptocurrency where many of the customer safeguards which underpin standard online banking transactions, some mandated by law, do not apply.\n\"When they treat you like this, it makes you feel like you can't do anything,\" he told BBC News. \"Like you are powerless.\"\nWhile the cryptocurrency market is dominated by Bitcoin, there is a plethora of other digital currencies, including USDC - which Tzoni had already amassed in a separate crypto account.\nHis frustrations began in February when he decided to transfer some of his USDC coins to his Revolut account.\nAs a precaution - which Revolut suggests doing - he first sent 10 of the coins, worth $10. It was a success and the funds were credited to his Revolut account.\nDays later he tried to make a larger transfer of what he thought was 1,500 USDC. The transfer was completed but, this time, the funds were not credited to his account.\nTzoni says the problem occurred because Revolut's deposit instructions were unclear.\nWhen you transfer cryptocurrency from one account to another, you have to select a network to send it through - like choosing which courier service to use when sending a parcel.\nRevolut's deposit instructions say to transfer USDC to it, you have to use a network called Polygon. In his first, successful, deposit Tzoni selected one called \"Polygon PoS\".\nIn the second deposit, when he tried to transfer 1,500 USDC, he selected a different network - \"Polygon (bridged)\". \nHe thought it would work just as well but says instead it caused the coins to be converted into USDC.e - a different cryptocurrency. \nThis is what Revolut received. The company does not handle USDC.e coins.\nAfter seeing his Revolut account had not been credited with the 1,500 coins, Tzoni contacted the Revolut support team.\nIn messages seen by BBC News, they told him the issue seemed to be with \"the specific type of Polygon network used, which led to the conversion\".\nIn another, he was told: \"The app currently specifies 'Polygon' without differentiating between standard and bridged options. I'll note your feedback for future improvements.\"\nTzoni thinks if Revolut's deposit instructions had been more specific, his problem would have been avoided.\nWhen approached by BBC News about this case, Revolut gave a different answer.\nThe firm said the problem was not because Tzoni had used the wrong Polygon network - which he claimed turned his coins into USDC.e.\nThe deposit failure was \"not because the network itself had 'converted' the token\", it said, without explaining why its support team had suggested to Tzoni that it was.\nRevolut told us the deposit ultimately failed because the USDC.e coins it received were not supported by the company's technology.\nIt said: \"As is standard industry practice due to the significant technical challenges involved in supporting every combination of token and chain, the recovery of these unsupported assets does not sit within Revolut's scope.\"\nIt means the 1,500 USDC.e coins have not been credited to Tzoni's account or sent back to him.\nTo Tzoni's mind, this isn't acceptable treatment from a company of Revolut's size and reputation, which handles normal banking deposits as well as cryptocurrency, stocks and commodities.\nRevolut says it has 10 million users in the UK while last year it was granted a provisional banking licence, paving the way for it to become a fully fledged UK bank.\nWhen using a High Street bank, a mistaken transfer of traditional currency would usually be resolved with the money being reverted back to the customer.\nThis was established in 2014 in a voluntary code of practice that most UK banks signed up to. There is no such equivalent in the cryptocurrency industry.\nAfter contacting Revolut several times in recent weeks, Tzoni has been told the coins are effectively lost.\n\"They are waiting for me to get bored and give up, to accept the money is gone. But I won't,\" Tzoni said, pointing out the coins are in the Revolut system. \"It is ridiculous that they can behave like this.\"\nWhile Tzoni's loss of cryptocurrency is significant to him, the sum is tiny compared with the size of the industry, which has risen sharply in value over the past 18 months.\nThe global market peaked in value at $3.9tn last December, following the re-election of Donald Trump. Since then it has fallen by $1.1tn, according to tracking website CoinGecko.\nGovernment policies in the US and other countries are also changing to favour the cryptocurrency industry, even though it has suffered several scandals.\nFTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency firms, went bankrupt in 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried, its chief executive, was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year for defrauding customers of billions of dollars.\nInvestigators also found FTX was using QuickBooks, a popular accounting software designed for individuals and small businesses, to manage the money.\nJohn Ray III, a lawyer tasked with recovering funds from FTX for defrauded customers, told a bankruptcy court: \"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.\"\nHe later told a congressional hearing: \"Nothing against QuickBooks. It's a very nice tool, just not for a multibillion-dollar company.\"\nA couple of months ago Bybit, the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange by some estimates, was tricked out of $1.5bn worth of coins by hackers thought to be working for North Korea.\nThe firm had been using Safe, a free digital storage software popular with individuals who want to store cryptocurrency on their own devices, as part of their business operations.\nFollowing the theft, Bybit's chief executive said they \"should have upgraded and moved away from Safe\" earlier.\nOne of the problems with cryptocurrency firms, says Prof Mark Button, who researches cybercrime, is they can grow very quickly, which means they don't always keep up with the accounting and security challenges of managing so much money.\n\"For me it illustrates that if we are going to be serious about cryptocurrencies in the future\u2026 there needs to be some kind of regulation.\"\nIn Tzoni's case, it might have been easier for him to get his cryptocurrency back or be compensated if there were laws stating what firms need to do if they are sent a coin they don't handle.\nHigher industry standards might also have prevented him making such a transaction in the first place.\nMykhailo Tiutin is chief technology officer at AMLBot, a company that analyses how risky cryptocurrency transactions are.\nTheir service runs checks similar to those supported by banks, where details for a transfer, such as the account holder's name, sort code and account number, are verified.\nHe says cryptocurrency is safe enough for the average person to use but that they should be careful about which products and services they choose. He says he has also lost cryptocurrency after making an administrative mistake.\n\"You have to do your own research,\" he told us. \"The successes and the losses are ultimately at your own risk.\"",

        "article_text": "Fr Jorge Bergoglio often described Ireland affectionately as \"the green country\", recalling his first impressions of its landscape when, in 1980, he spent a short sabbatical in Dublin trying to improve his English.\nWhen the Argentinian priest made a return visit, in August 2018, he was known by a different name: Pope Francis.\nThe Vatican confirmed that Pope Francis died at the age of 88 on Easter Monday. \nDuring the 2018 visit, he became only the second pope in the church's history to set foot on Irish soil.\nJohn Paul II, who visited in 1979 at the height of the Troubles, famously told a crowd of 300,000 people in Drogheda: \"On my knees, I beg you to turn away from the paths of violence and return to the ways of peace.\"\nNearly 40 years later, at a state reception in Dublin Castle, Pope Francis lauded the work of those who negotiated the Good Friday Agreement and expressed his \"firm hope that the peace process will overcome every remaining obstacle and help give birth to a future of harmony, reconciliation and mutual trust\".\nHowever, the former Irish President Mary McAleese said the Pope \"took wrong advice\" when planning his visit to Dublin by not visiting Northern Ireland.\nIt was \"completely wrong-headed,\" she told BBC's Evening Extra programme.\n\"He should have gone,\" she added.\n\"The leaders of the protestant churches had invited him to Northern Ireland. Itself a wonderful, miraculous thing, and he didn't go... At the time there was no government in place in Northern Ireland and that might have weighed heavily in the thinking, but I also just think he got bad advice.\"\nArchbishop Eamon Martin, the primate of All Ireland, says the Pope often asked for updates on the Irish peace process when they met.\n\"He had a great interest in how things were in Northern Ireland, and how well the peace was developing. And he asked if he could make a message to Ireland to commend us on the journey of peace that we have taken and to encourage us to persevere on that road.\"\nArchbishop Martin believes that commitment to peace inspired the Pope's choice of papal name.\n\"He chose the name Francis, of course, and it was a daring thing to do.  He was the first Pope ever to use the name of the great Saint Francis of Assisi. \n\"And that message of peace, of praising God in creation, the message of brotherhood and sisterhood\u2014of fraternity\u2014characterised the pontificate of Pope Francis.\"\nBut between those two papal visits \u2014 from John Paul's passionate pleading for peace to Francis's endorsement of an historic peace process \u2014 Ireland had changed almost beyond recognition.\nA country once seen as a citadel of global Catholicism had seen plummeting church attendance as the moral credibility of bishops and priests was undermined by the twin forces of secularisation and the clerical abuse crisis.\nIn welcoming the Pope, then Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar told him Ireland was a more diverse, less religious place, a country which understood that \"marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions, and that families come in many different, wonderful forms, including those headed by a grandparent, lone parent or same-sex parents, or parents who are divorced\".\nAs Ireland's first gay head of government, Varadkar seemed to embody the social transformation he was describing.\nThe taoiseach also called for a \"new relationship between church and state\", urging the Pope to address the \"history of sorrow and shame\" laid bare by the abuse of vulnerable children.\nHours later, Francis met eight survivors of clerical abuse for 90 minutes at the Vatican embassy in Dublin.\nAt the final Mass in Phoenix Park the next day, the Pope recalled that meeting and then offered a series of apologies, written in his own hand, for the \"crimes\" of clerical abuse and made a public plea for forgiveness.\nFr Timothy Bartlett, who had a key role in planning the Pope's visit, says this \"penitential act\" was \"the most profound, eloquent and developed apology to those who had been hurt by abuse in the church\".\n\"I am absolutely satisfied that historians will look back at that and regard it as one of the most profound apologies ever given on this issue.\"\nIt was Fr Bartlett who gave the Pope the sheet of paper he used to pen that historic apology on the flight from the Knock Shrine to the Irish capital.\n\"I think it will go down as one of the most eloquent, personal and profound acknowledgements of all of that issue and hurt,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme on Monday.\n\"He had been dealing with all these other things, but he stayed attentive to the victims of abuse he had met the night before.\n\"That was what was dominant in his mind.\"\nArchbishop Martin thinks it is also significant that Pope Francis asked to meet with homeless people at the Capuchin Day Centre in Dublin.\n\"Pope Francis always exercised a preferential option for the poor, for those on the peripheries, for those who were not only poor materially, but who were excluded from society, or indeed from the church.\n\"He wanted to walk to them, to accompany them. I think that made him fearless in speaking quite prophetically to the church, to society and to the global world.\"\nWhen the Pope completed his 32-hour visit to Ireland, he returned to his home in Rome, where he had chosen to live amongst others in a Vatican guesthouse, rather than reside in the solitary splendour of the Apostolic Palace.\nMore than once, he publicly criticised bishops who spent large sums of money to support a lavish lifestyle. And he warned new cardinals not to see themselves as \"princes of the church\", but rather as servants.\n\"Humility\", the Pope would later say, \"is the gateway to all virtues.\"\nIt was this personal modesty that impressed so many who met Pope Francis\u2014even those outside the Catholic fold.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson told BBC News NI that Pope Francis \"injected a level of humility that we don't often recognise within the Catholic Church, that you don't see through the opulence of St Peter's Basilica, Rome, the Vatican, the state that it is\". \n\"No flashy cars, no flashy suits, no flashy shoes. He was somewhat different and he brought the sort of early principles of Christian faith that I would recognise into a role that I see quite far apart from that. \n\"So he wanted to do things differently. He seemed a more gentle, humble, engaging, caring individual.\"",

        "article_text": "He had tea with the Queen, was blessed by the Pope and spread Hawaiian culture across the globe. More than a century later, a festival dubbed the \"Olympics of hula\" honours his legacy.\nSilence engulfed the audience at Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, Hawai'i, as a group of hula dancers appeared on stage. They moved gracefully in unison, rhythmically depicting a scene of an ancient Hawaiian myth as they bellowed \nmele\n (chants). The hula performance, which was part of the annual \nMerrie Monarch Festival\n, wasn't a mere spectacle; it was a powerful celebration of Hawaiian culture \u2013 and for years, it was banned.\nThe week-long Merrie Monarch Festival (which takes place 20-26 April 2025 and is celebrating its 62nd anniversary) has been called the \"\nOlympics of hula\n\" and perpetuates the sacred, centuries-old practice of dancing and chanting that preserves and portrays our native Hawaiian language, history, religion and culture. Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 best \nh\u0101lau\n (hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.\n\"It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,\" said K\u016b Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. \"And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King Kal\u0101kaua.\"\nFondly dubbed \"The Merrie Monarch\", King David La'amea Kal\u0101kaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislature\u00a0decided to elect a native\u00a0ali'i\u00a0(noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and Kal\u0101kaua took the oath of office the following day.\nBy the time of Kal\u0101kaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed \"vile heathen chants\".\nKal\u0101kaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the motto Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0(Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians \u2013 all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As Kal\u0101kaua famously proclaimed: \"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\"\u00a0\nTo many people around the world, \"hula\" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians \u2013 an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.\nAs part of Kal\u0101kaua's Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and l\u016b'au \u2013\u00a0all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later, \nho'opa'a \n(chanters) and \n'\u014dlapa \n(dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity Kal\u0101kaua revived.\n\"[Kal\u0101kaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,\" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have the \nKumulipo\n (a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, Kal\u0101kaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the \"Merrie Monarch\" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring by\u00a0spending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.\nDuring Kal\u0101kaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds of\u00a0Hawai'i Pono'\u012b\u00a0(the Kingdom's national anthem, which Kal\u0101kaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, Kal\u0101kaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.\u00a0'Iolani Palace\u00a0(which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights \u2013 five years before the White House did.\n\"He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],\" said Kenneth \"Aloha\" Victor, a kumu hula (master hula teacher) and designer of Kaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, Kal\u0101kaua maintained consulates and legations in more than 130 cities across the globe. The Kingdom had 13 consulates in Great Britain alone.\nBack at home, during an era of increased literacy, Kal\u0101kaua met with traditional na kahuna (priests) and na kapuna (elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book, Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The word embodying the spirit of Hawai'i\n\u2022 A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\nKal\u0101kaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of the Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art.\u00a0More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands: Princess Abigail Kaw\u0101nanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.\nA multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, Kal\u0101kaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be found hosting royal l\u016b'aus\u00a0for foreign dignitaries and heads of state.\nFor Hawaiians today, Kal\u0101kaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. \"When Kal\u0101kaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,\" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. \"It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.\"\nFor those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. \"Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,\" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.\nOf course, Kal\u0101kaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, l\u016b'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world. Visitors can experience this first hand at O'ahu's Polynesian Cultural Center, which hosts a traditional Hawaiian l\u016b'au paying homage to Queen Lili'uokalani (Kal\u0101kaua's sister, who succeeded him until white businessmen\u00a0overthrew the Kingdom in 1893), while the Queen Emma Summer Palace\u00a0in Honolulu offers contemporary hula lessons for adults.\nOn Maui, immersive experiences at the\u00a0Grand Wailea\u00a0include an E Ala E\u00a0oli\u00a0(chant) in the mornings on the beach, while interactive language lessons teach guests how to pronounce words in\u00a0\u02bb\u014clelo Hawai'i\u00a0(Hawaiian). Beachside resorts like\u00a0Outrigger Reef in Waikiki Beach are adopting a regenerative tourism approach at its A'o Cultural Center by allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and \u2013 yes \u2013 participate in hula lessons.\n\"It all spawns back to [King Kal\u0101kaua's] creed,\" said Victor. \"That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.\"\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story stated that\u00a0US sugar planters overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i.

        "article_text": "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.\n\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.\nLucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.\nLucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.\nThe condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.\nLucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.\nThe abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.\n\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.\nThis is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.\nWithout medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.\nShe pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"\nAnd that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.\nIt is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.\nIn 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.\nIt is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.\n\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\" \nLucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.\nShe says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.\n\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"\nIP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.\n\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"\nIn response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.\nBut Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.\n\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.\n\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"\n\nLucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.\nNHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.\n\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"\nHer health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.\n\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"\nOnce she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.\nShe will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.\nOver a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.\nMeanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.\nThe embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.\nLucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.\n\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"\nA few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.\n\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.\n\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"\nYou can listen to Lucy Edwards on BBC Access All on BBC Sounds.

        "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance has responded to Pope Francis's death, acknowledging his meeting with the pontiff on Easter Sunday.\n\"My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,\" Vance wrote in a statement posted to social media platform X. \"I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill.\"\nVance, who converted to Catholicism as an adult, had diplomatic meetings with Vatican officials over the weekend before he left Rome for India. \nHe followed his statement with a link to his favourite homily by the late Pope - a March 2020 address on fear and faith that was given during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe White House also offered condolences on X, with an unsigned statement that read: \"Rest in Peace, Pope Francis.\"\nThe meeting with Pope Francis was not originally on Vance's schedule for the trip to Italy. But sources had said Vance was hoping he could secure even a brief moment with the Pope - a personal goal for him as a Catholic, as well as a political one. \nThe pontiff was a long-time critic of US President Donald Trump. In 2016, he questioned then-presidential candidate Trump's faith, saying \"a person who thinks only about building walls... and not of building bridges, is not Christian\". \nRecently, he referred to Trump's immigration views as \"an ugly thing\", and his plans to ramp up deportations as a \"disgrace\". Caring for migrants was a signature issue for the Pope. \nVance has defended Trump's policies, sometimes invoking his own religious beliefs in response to the criticism. Still, his visit was aimed at thawing relations, insiders said.\nOn Saturday, Vance also met the Vatican's secretary of state and secretary for relations with states and international organisation.\nIn a statement, the Vatican described \"cordial talks\" on Saturday that affirmed \"good existing bilateral relations\" and a \"common commitment\" to protect freedom of religion.\nOn Sunday, Vance's office confirmed a visit to the Pope that lasted about 15 minutes. Vance \"expressed his gratitude to Pope Francis for inviting him to meet on Easter Sunday and for the hospitality the Vatican has extended to his family\".  \nVance converted to Catholicism in 2019, then in his mid-30s.

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer.\nThe controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages.\n\"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\"\nWhite House officials have played down reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it.\nTrump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary.\n\"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media,\" he said. \"Try finding something new,\" he said. \nTrump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea  also floated by Hegseth earlier on Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".\nHegseth did not directly respond to reports of a second Signal chat, which were initially covered by the New York Times.\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.\nThe messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times. But it too appeared to share details of military operations against Yemen.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nAlthough the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents. Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices.\nThe second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth criticised the media and denounced the reports. He also said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\".\nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, the top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said the \"Trump-hating media\" was  \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nUS air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.",

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

Maria, who was 24 and lived at home with her mole-catcher father, a stepmother, sister, and her young son, may have seen young William as a means of escape.\nIn 1827, William came up with a plan to elope, telling Maria to meet him at the Red Barn on the Corder's farm, then run off to Ipswich to get the banns for their wedding. \nMaria was not seen again and William disappeared.\nWilliam eventually left Suffolk and wrote to the Marten family to say he had eloped with Maria to the Isle of Wight.\nIn reality, he was holed up just outside London and Maria was buried at the lovers' rendezvous, having been shot in the neck.\nAlmost a year later, legend states, Ann Marten had a dream her stepdaughter was dead and at the Red Barn. Maria's father dug with his \"mole spud\" spade and found his daughter's remains.\nAs a manhunt ensued, a newspaper editor flagged that he knew of a William Corder.\n\"He is effectively on the run, and the theory is he's lonely, and puts an advert in the newspaper asking for a new wife,\" says Dan Clarke, a heritage officer at Moyse's Hall Museum. It holds many Red Barn Murder artefacts, including two books covered in Corder's skin.\nThe authorities traced Corder, who denies any knowledge of Maria, but has a letter from Polstead telling him her body has been found.\nCorder was brought to Bury St Edmunds on 10 counts of murder, each based on a different theory about Maria's demise and to strengthen the chance of a conviction.\nIn his defence he claimed Maria had killed herself, thereby accusing the dead woman of a capital crime. He was found guilty after a two-day trial, and in a final confession said he had accidentally shot Maria during an argument.\nIt is estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people came to see him hanged outside the prison at the stroke of noon on 11 August 1828. Later that day, people queued to file past his body at the town's Shire Hall. \n\"There were so many people, the story goes they couldn't get him outside the prison, so they had to hit a hole in the side of the building and create a temporary scaffold,\" said Mr Clarke.\n\"There would have been singing and dancing, you would have been able  to buy a section of the rope afterwards.\"\nPolstead became a tourist attraction, the Red Barn and even Maria's gravestone chipped away by souvenir-hunters.\nPublic intrigue in the Red Barn Murder sparked books, plays and music, and it permeates the true crime culture to this day.\nAt a distance of two centuries, it has become a ripping yarn, the true story clouded in legend.\nIt is probably fuelled, in part, by being able to stand face-to-face with Corder's image, his eyes shut and his nostrils flared. His death mask is held at Moyse Hall and Norwich Castle.\nFor many years, until it eventually began to fall apart, his skeleton was used to teach medical students at West Suffolk Hospital.\nDisturbingly, two books were covered in his skin and part of the man's scalp, with ear included, was kept as a gruesome ornament.

        "article_text": "Britain's state-owned energy company will not be allowed to use solar panels linked to Chinese slave labour, under changes to government plans.\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband will introduce an amendment to legislation to ensure there is no slavery in GB Energy's supply chains.\nIt comes after ministers rejected an amendment to a bill last month that would have prevented GB Energy spending money on solar panels where supply chains had \"credible evidence of modern slavery\".\nThe production of solar panels in China's Xinjiang region has been linked to the alleged exploitation of Uyghur Muslims.\nChina has dominated the renewables market and up to 50% of the world's supply of polysilicon - a key component in solar panels \u2013 comes from the Xinjiang region.\nIt is a dilemma for the UK, which imports more than 40% of its solar PV from China, according to HMRC data.\nDozens of Labour MPs abstained in a vote on the amendment which was put forward by crossbench peer Lord Alton when the Great British Energy Bill was in the House of Lords.\nA government source told the BBC since then \"there has been an acknowledgement of the argument that GB Energy should be an industry leader\".\nThere has already been praise from the international community for the U-turn.

This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.\nTrump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war.\nIn his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be \"very nice\" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal. \nEarlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was \"not a joke\".\nThe trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed. \nThe Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised.\nLast week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him \"a major loser\". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses. \nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden.\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so.\nMost major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%.\nThat came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%. \nUS futures were also trading higher overnight.

Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks.\nOn Tuesday, the forecast for US economic growth for this year was given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.\nThe sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a \"significant slowdown\" in global growth, the Fund predicted.\nTrump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China.

        "article_text": "As US President Donald Trump takes aim at the Smithsonian Institution for \"anti-American ideology\", Adam Rutherford examines what the science of genetics has taught us about race.\nWhen scientists unveiled the first draft of the Human Genome Project 25 years ago, it seemed to deliver the final word on some antiquated myths about race. It provided definitive evidence that racial groupings have no biological basis. In fact, there is more genetic variation within racial groups than between them. Race, it showed, is a social construct.\nBut despite that fundamental finding, which has only been reinforced as work on human genomes has continued, race and ethnicity are still often deployed to categorise human populations as distinct biological groups. These are views that can be found circulating in the pseudoscience on social media, but they also still creep into scientific research and \u00a0healthcare systems.\nComment & Analysis\nAdam Rutherford is a lecturer in genetics at Univeristy College London in the UK, BBC Presenter and author of How to Argue with a Racist, which examines the history and science of notions of race. You can read more from him about how to debunk racist myths with science and facts here.\nIt is even more troubling when this thinking finds its way into the halls of government.\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have made no secret of his rejection of many aspects of the scientific worldview. Since returning to the White House, he has made sweeping cuts to science funding for biomedical and climate research, but in a recent Executive Order, Trump took aim at what most scientists now regard as biological reality.\nEntitled \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\", the Presidential order, signed by Trump, targeted an exhibition in the Smithsonian American Art Museum called \"The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture\".\nThe order is part of a broader attempt to shape American culture by eliminating \"improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology\" from the institute's museums. It states: \"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2013 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history.\"\u00a0\nThe exhibition itself is criticised in the text for promoting the idea that \"race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating 'race is a human invention'\". The order offers the exhibition as an example of a \"harmful and oppressive\" shift in the narrative portraying American values.\u00a0\nThis is the point when people like me, a geneticist who specialises in the history of race science, get a little bit vexed.\nThe issue here is that the sentence cited from the Smithsonian is 100% correct. This is neither controversial in science nor history.\nHuman variation is, of course, very real. People are different, and we can see those differences in skin pigmentation, in hair colour and texture and in other physical characteristics. These differences cluster in locations around the world: people from the same region on average look more similar to each other than to people from other areas \u2013 so far, so obvious.\nIn the 18th Century, these traits were the primary determinants for a new fashion for categorising humans in supposedly scientific terms. The Swedish botanist Karl Linnaeus is legitimately credited as the father of modern biology, as he gave us the classification system we still use today: genus and species. Every living thing is named according to this system, for example the bacteria Escherichia coli, or the lion, Panthera leo, or Gorilla gorilla, which probably doesn't need explaining.\nWe are Homo sapiens \u2013 wise people. But in his foundational work Systemae Naturae, Linnaeus introduced another tier of classification for us, designated primarily by that most visible of human traits: pigmentation. Linnaeus gave us four types of human, lumped together by continental landmasses: Asiaticus \u2013 people with \"yellow skin\", and straight black hair; Americanus \u2013 indigenous Americans, with \"red skin\" also with straight black hair; Africanus \u2013 \"black skinned\" people with tight curls in their hair; and Europeaus \u2013 \"white skinned\" with blue eyes.\nThese designations are clearly absurd \u2013 none of the colours are accurate, even if you took the obviously incorrect view that millions of people share the same skin tones even within those categories. But the roots of the race designations we still use today are visible in these labels. Some of these terms have fallen out of social acceptability and are considered racist. But we still use \"black\" and \"white\" as descriptors for millions of people, none of whom really have either black or white skin.\nEven if this colour scheme were true, Linnaeus' original descriptions only began with physical traits. What he included in later editions of Systemae Naturae, which became the basis for scientific racism, were portrayals of behaviours. Asiaticus were described as \"haughty, greedy and ruled by opinions\" while Americanus were labelled \"stubborn, zealous, regulated by customs\". Africanus women were denoted as being \"without shame\" while both sexes were said to be \"crafty, lazy, and governed by caprice\". He described Europaeus as \"gentle, acute, inventive, governed by laws\".\nBy any definition in any age, these assertions are racist and entirely incorrect.\nOf course, in examining history, we must be wary of judging people from the past by our own standards. But as the foundational text of modern biology, introducing a classification system for humans that is ludicrous, racist and most importantly, hierarchical, would leave an indelible mark on the centuries that followed.\nOver the next 200 years, many men would seek to refine these categories with new metrics, including pseudoscientific interpretations of craniometry, or skull measurements. They never settled on a definitive answer about how many races there are \u2013 none of the characteristics that were being used are immutable, nor exclusive to the people to whom they were supposedly essential. We call this ideology \"racial essentialism\". But all of the many schemes put white Europeans as superior to all others.\nIt was biologist Charles Darwin who first began to unpick these ideas, recognising in his 1871 book the Descent of Man that there was much more continuity in traits between people that had been designated as discrete races. By the beginning of the 20th Century, molecular biology had entered the stage, and the era of genetics would dismantle the biological concept of race.\u00a0\nBy the time we began to look at how genes are shared in families and populations, we saw that similarities do indeed cluster in groups, but these groupings do not align with the longstanding attempts to classify the races. The true metric of human difference is at a genetic level. In the 20th Century, when we began to unravel our genomes, and observe how people are similar and different in our DNA, we saw that the terms in use for several centuries bore little meaningful relation to the underlying genetics.\nEven though only a tiny percentage of our DNA differs between individuals, the genome is so large and complex that there is great diversity. Geneticists are still working to unravel how this alters people's health, for example. But those genetic differences do not delineate along the lines of what we call race. They follow ancestral lines, can differ by geographic location and can be traced through historic migration patterns.\nWhat we now know is that there is more genetic diversity in people of recent African descent than in the rest of the world put together. Take two people, for example from Ethiopia and Namibia, and they will be more different to each other at a genetic level than either one of them is to a white European, or indeed a Japanese person, an Inuit or an Indian. This includes the genes that are involved in pigmentation.\nYet, for historical reasons, we continue to refer to both Ethiopians and Namibians under the race definition of \"black\". Or take African Americans, people largely descended from enslaved Africans brought to the New World: sequencing the genomes of Black Americans reveals echoes of the history of transatlantic slavery. They not only mixed genetic ancestry from the handful of West African countries from which their ancestors were taken, but also significant amounts of White European DNA. This reflects the fact that slave owners had sexual relationships \u2013 many of which would not have been consensual \u2013 with enslaved people.\u00a0\nTherefore, the simple categorisation of descendants of the enslaved as \"black\" similarly does not make biological sense.\u00a0They are genetically diverse in themselves and different from the African ancestors from which they are descended. To lump them together makes no scientific sense.\nSo it is by consensus, usage and history that we continue to use the term \"black\". This is what we mean by a social construct. The concept of race has little utility as a biological taxonomy. But it is enormously important socially and culturally. Social constructs are how the world works: money and time are both socially constructed too. The value of a pound or dollar is applied by agreement against goods and services. Time passes unerringly, but hours and minutes are entirely arbitrary units.\nSo, while race is not biologically meaningful, it has biologically meaningful consequences. The impact of most diseases correlates with poverty. As people of ethnic minority ancestry tend to be in lower tiers of socio-economic status, diseases tend to affect them more severely. This is true across the board, but was exposed early on in the pandemic. Black, South Asian and in America Hispanic people were disproportionately infected with and died of Covid-19.\nThe media immediately began to search for a reason that reified a biological version of race, sometimes focusing on vitamin D metabolism, which is connected with melanin production, and has effects on viral infections. Some studies showed that lower levels of vitamin D did associate with susceptibility to covid infection among black people.\u00a0But this is a correlation not a cause.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The people whose DNA held a secret\n\u2022 Why you have viruses hiding in our DNA\n\u2022 The mystery of the human genome\u2019s dark matter\nUnderlying any slight differences in biology are much more potent causes: while so many of us were locked down, frontline NHS workers, people cleaning up our rubbish and driving our buses all were more likely to be from ethnic minorities. They simply had a higher risk of being exposed and so infected with the virus. Combine that with the fact that minority groups are more likely to live in multigenerational, dense urban housing, and the supposedly biological susceptibility fades.\nThis is why genetics has played such an important role in the dismantling of a scientific justification of race and understanding racism itself. And it's why the latest statement from Trump's White House is troubling many in the scientific community.\nTrump frequently speaks about aspects of genetics to make political points. One view that he has expressed repeatedly is that some people, and predictably himself, are genetically superior. \"You have good genes, you know that, right?\" he said in September 2020 to a rally in Minnesota \u2013 a state that is more than 80% white. \"You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn't it, don't you believe? You have good genes in Minnesota.\"\nSimilarly, in the successful 2024 campaign, he denounced immigrants as having \"bad genes\". It's hard for someone who studies genes \u2013 and the strange and sometimes troubling history of genetics \u2013 to understand even what might constitute a \"bad\" or \"good\" gene.\nOurs may be a pernicious history, but the trajectory of genetics has been one that tends towards progress, and equity for all, as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta sanctioned Partey's move to the Gunners from Atletico Madrid \nArsenal midfielder Thomas Partey's future remains unclear but recently appointed sporting director Andrea Berta may have the key to unlocking the uncertainty surrounding the player's contractual impasse.\nThe 31-year-old is approaching the end of what many consider his best season since joining Arsenal, yet it remains to be seen what comes next for the Gunners star.\nHis importance was demonstrated by the frustration shown at him picking up a booking that rules him out of the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Paris St-Germain. The yellow card came in the 85th minute for a needless exchange with Dani Ceballos with the score 5-1 in Arsenal's favour.\nHe has become an integral member of Mikel Arteta's strongest team, making 45 appearances this season, and his absence against the Parisians will be a clear blow to their hopes of progressing to the final. It therefore seems inconceivable that he finds himself in such limbo but with Partey there is plenty to consider.\nAnd the direction of travel thus far has been that the Ghana international would leave the Emirates Stadium when his contract expires at the end of the season.\nArteta gave a cryptic answer when asked about Partey's contractual situation last week.\nAsked if there had been any progress, Arteta said: \"Yes, there is progress with all the players.\n\"I'll leave that to [sporting director] Andrea [Berta] and the club to decide and to talk about.\"\nPushed further whether the intention is to keep Partey, Arteta added: \"The intention is very clear. I'll leave that to Andrea and the club to take a step forward.\"\nThe fact Partey is yet to sign a new contract with only a month of the season to go might seem to suggest the club are not urgently seeking to retain him.\nConversations are ongoing as to whether Arsenal offer Partey a new contract.\nWhether that signals a significant change of approach for the Gunners remains to be seen, but according to well-placed sources Berta's arrival as sporting director has provided an alternative outlook as to whether Partey could have a future beyond the end of the season.\nBerta and Partey have a long-standing relationship having worked together at Atletico Madrid and it was Berta who sanctioned Partey's move to Arsenal for \u00a345m in 2020.\nOne factor Arsenal will be considering will be the expected arrival of Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in the summer - would Partey still have a regular role in Arteta's team if the Spain international signed?\nWith that in mind, it makes little financial sense to offer Partey a contract similar to the \u00a3200,000-per-week he is currently earning if he will not be starting most weeks.\nIt is also key to remember that last season he managed just 15 appearances for the Gunners because of persistent injury concerns, though the groin surgery he underwent at the end of 2023 is understood to have cleared up those ongoing issues.\nNevertheless, his age and his previous injury record over the course of his stay have been considerations - among other factors - regarding any offer of an extension.\nIf Partey were to leave there is said to be growing interest from abroad.\nHe has been linked with a return to Atletico Madrid, while Barcelona are said to be interested in signing him on a free transfer.

        "summary": "\"The fact Partey is yet to sign a new contract with only a month of the season to go might seem to suggest the club are not urgently seeking to retain him.Conversations are ongoing as to whether Arsenal offer Partey a new contract.Whether that signals a significant change of approach for the Gunners remains to be seen, but according to well-placed sources Berta's arrival as sporting director has provided an alternative outlook as to whether Partey could have a future beyond the end of the season.Berta and Partey have a long-standing relationship having worked together at Atletico Madrid and it was Berta who sanctioned Partey's move to Arsenal for \u00a345m in 2020.One factor Arsenal will be considering will be the expected arrival of Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad in the summer - would Partey still have a regular role in Arteta's team if the Spain international signed?With that in mind, it makes little financial sense to offer Partey a contract similar to the \u00a3200,000-per-week he is currently earning if he will not be starting most weeks.It is also key to remember that last season he managed just 15 appearances for the Gunners because of persistent injury concerns, though the groin surgery he underwent at the end of 2023 is understood to have cleared up those ongoing issues.Nevertheless, his age and his previous injury record over the course of his stay have been considerations - among other factors - regarding any offer of an extension.If Partey were to leave there is said to be growing interest from abroad.He has been linked with a return to Atletico Madrid, while Barcelona are said to be interested in signing him on a free transfer. Berta may hold key to Partey's Arsenal futureImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta sanctioned Partey's move to the Gunners from Atletico Madrid Sami MokbelSenior football correspondentPublished23 April 2025Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey's future remains unclear but recently appointed sporting director Andrea Berta may have the key to unlocking the uncertainty surrounding the player's contractual impasse.The 31-year-old is approaching the end of what many consider his best season since joining Arsenal, yet it remains to be seen what comes next for the Gunners star.His importance was demonstrated by the frustration shown at him picking up a booking that rules him out of the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Paris St-Germain. \"I'll leave that to [sporting director] Andrea [Berta] and the club to decide and to talk about. It therefore seems inconceivable that he finds himself in such limbo but with Partey there is plenty to consider.And the direction of travel thus far has been that the Ghana international would leave the Emirates Stadium when his contract expires at the end of the season.Arteta gave a cryptic answer when asked about Partey's contractual situation last week.Asked if there had been any progress, Arteta said: \"Yes, there is progress with all the players. I'll leave that to Andrea and the club to take a step forward.",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions.

This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Leicester have been relegated from the Premier League after defeat to Liverpool \nThe banner flown over the King Power Stadium made its point. \n'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool.\nA second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwards as Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winner put the visitors within three points of the Premier League title.\nIt has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. \nThe drop had been coming - Leicester have won just once since December - and there was an air of resignation around the ground, even before Alexander-Arnold's strike. \nThere are unhappy and disconnected fans, players accused of giving up, and a manager in Ruud van Nistelrooy who, despite his pedigree as a player, has seen the Foxes get worse on his watch. \nThere were some boos at full-time, but the majority of home fans had already left. Those who stayed offered a smattering of applause, yet it was an empty gesture.\nIt reflected a club in need of a rebuild but how, and with who, are the biggest questions as Leicester - champions of England nine years ago - face one of their biggest crossroads.\nLeicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold moves Liverpool closer to title\n'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\n'My responsibility to lead the club in the best way' - Nistelrooy\nWhen the Foxes sacked Steve Cooper in October they were 16th, although the cracks were there.\nThe teething problems in moving away from Enzo Maresca's style - less expansive and working the ball quicker - were just part of the issue. \nThe departed Maresca, who led them to the Championship title last season before joining Chelsea, was well-liked by the squad and Cooper struggled to connect with players, even if some of the senior members of the squad - including Jamie Vardy - were onside. \nThere was growing concern from the club that any disconnect would impact their survival prospects, and one of the reasons why they dismissed Cooper. \nSo, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.\nFormer Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.\nYet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.\nThey have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.\nThe Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. \nThat is in stark contrast to the lack of goals under Van Nistelrooy - a revered striker for Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Netherlands - and they have scored just six times in the league since the draw with Brighton on 8 December.\nAnother goalless outing against Liverpool extended the home goal drought to nine league games and 810 minutes - the worst in top-flight history.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"They have some big decisions to make. It has been awful for them. They have been miles off it.\"\nSome players have recently raised concerns over the standard and intensity of training with the drop-off being connected to Leicester's impending relegation, which was becoming increasingly inevitable.\nThe fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks - Van Nistelrooy has dropped him for the last four games for refusing to agree to stay at the training ground one night a week - emphasises the growing tensions. \nWhen asked about whether he had been able to improve the standards and culture in his five months at the club, Van Nistelrooy was clear.\n\"When you don't combine them with results it's always hard. There's no negotiation on these standards and I hold everyone accountable on those,\" the Dutchman said this month. \n\"I know how I worked from a village of 5,000 people in the middle of nowhere to Manchester United and Real Madrid. I know what is necessary to stay at the highest level and I know there are so many people working at this football club who have the quality to do so. But not enough yet. \n\"In difficult moments you get to know people and characters very well. I speak about standards and what is needed to perform at the highest level and that's a culture which needs to be created in this club.\"\nDefender Conor Coady has been one trying to raise spirits at the club's Seagrave training base, but it has been an almost impossible task with results - and he admitted Leicester have not been good enough. \n\"We've took a bit of stick and we'll continue to take stick because it's deserved,\" said the former England centre-back. \"From minute one this season, we haven't been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it'll chew you up and spit you out.\"\nSusan Whelan, Jon Rudkin and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha watched Leicester's defeat to Liverpool\nAs the plane's banner suggested, director of football Jon Rudkin and the board have been the target for fans this season.\nThey see Rudkin as a root cause of their decline in recent seasons. He was, of course, in the same position when the Foxes stunned the world to win the Premier League in 2016, but supporters have made up their minds. \nIt does not help that the hierarchy rarely speak publicly, allowing supporters to understand and digest the situation.\nChief executive Susan Whelan twice met with the Foxes Trust and the club's Fan Advisory Board in February for candid and constructive meetings but the wider fanbase remain disconnected.\nDoes chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha decide to make a change at the top, does head of recruitment Martyn Glover's position come under more scrutiny following a number of poor transfer windows, regardless of financial constraints?\nVan Nistelrooy's position remains a doubt and it is hard to see a long-term future in the wake of damning statistics. \nDefeat against Liverpool leaves him with the unenviable record of having lost 17 of his 22 games, winning just three. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?\nVan Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.\n\"It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there.\n\"The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it. In a situation like this you have to sit very carefully with the club to discuss the matters.\"\nYet sacking a second manager of the season has financial consequences and with money tight, it will be a consideration. Can Leicester financially afford to sack Van Nistelrooy but, going forward, can they afford not to?\nThere is also an acceptance the squad needs a reset but only three players are out of contract - goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, and 38-year-old captain Jamie Vardy. \nWhat happens with Vardy - influential at the club as their last remaining title winner and the scorer of 198 goals - remains open, but it's the biggest decision the club has to make in terms of the squad given his reputation and achievements.\nIt means Leicester must shift big earners to make wholesale changes to a squad which has, in the main, brought them down twice.\nWilfred Ndidi signed a new three-year contract last summer but his appetite for another Championship campaign is likely to have waned and the same will go for defenders Ricardo Pereira and Wout Faes. Although, as part of Leicester's decline, they must find takers.\nGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been a rare bright spot and will have his admirers, as will Bilal El Khannouss, despite an underwhelming first season in England, while Winks' situation could depend on Van Nistelrooy's exit. \nLike every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.\nLeicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.\nYet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float.  \nFor now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with.\nThey made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. This time their short-term future is far less certain.",

        "article_text": "Perched on top of Santorini's sheer cliffs is a world-famous tourist industry worth millions. Underneath is the fizzing risk of an almighty explosion.\nA huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.\nNow scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.\nBBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.\nJust weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.\nIt was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.\nProf Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.\n\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.\nThis work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent. \nSantorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".\n\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.\n\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.\nThe Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.\nBeneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.\n\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.\nThe robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.\nThose vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.\nThey are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.\nSo far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.\n\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.\nThe Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.\nThe two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.\nThe expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.\nShe is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.\n\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.\nIt will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.\nThese missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.\nJohn Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.\n\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"\nPointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"\nThese rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.\nBut the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.\nUsing a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found. \nThey have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.\nThey identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.\nThis is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.\n\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.\nThe recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.\nBack on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.\n\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.\nShe's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says.\nIn the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.\nShe believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting.\n\"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said.\nBut Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot.\nThe couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks.\n\"Actually we wanted to get married by a volcano,\" Tom says, his bride Kristina by his side.",

        "article_text": "Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold planted his shirt on the corner flag after scoring his winner at Leicester\nThe sight of Trent Alexander-Arnold celebrating bare chested with arms outstretched, his red shirt hoisted on a corner flag at King Power Stadium, will become an iconic image of Liverpool's march to the Premier League title.\nAmid the wild elation that followed his late winner at relegated Leicester City, it left Liverpool's big questions still hanging in the air.\nWill Alexander-Arnold leave his home city club behind in pursuit of new glory with Real Madrid in Spain? Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated. And the final part of the script was written when Alexander-Arnold returned as a substitute with 19 minutes left, having been out since early March with an ankle injury.\nPremier League: Leicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold scores Liverpool winner - report & reaction\n'I know why Real appeal to Alexander-Arnold - I was tempted too'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\nSuperstar Trent Alexander Arnold's 'unbelievable' left foot half-volley\nIt took him five minutes to release the pressure valve, of sorts, that had been building as the doomed Foxes frustrated Liverpool.\nThe scenes that followed will be tantalising ones for any Liverpool fan who clings to the hope Alexander-Arnold will reject the advances of Real Madrid.\nCould there still be a late twist in Alexander-Arnold's long-running contract situation?\nCould the wild celebrations, and the communion between Alexander-Arnold and those fans in one red-drenched corner of King Power Stadium, make him rethink his next move?\nThere is confidence in Spain that Alexander-Arnold will be at Real Madrid next season - but the leaving of Liverpool will still be tough for a player who grew up in the city's West Derby district.\nHe has faced some criticism for not committing to Liverpool, especially since Salah and Van Dijk signed new contracts, but there was none here. This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.\nThe fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously. \n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

While Tierney, he says, could play further infield, his strengths are more using his pace and dribbling ability to get behind defences and put crosses into the box.\nThose different strengths are why the Celtic manager sees them \"dovetailing perfectly\".\nBut it's not just about ability, but personality as well.

He's in tune with what being a Celtic player is about. You look at James [Forrest], Callum [McGregor], they live with the expectation, the feeling and what the demands are of this club and Greg lives that feeling as well.\"\nAll that said, no player is perfect.

I'm mostly excited for the inevitable moving moments, as we see the teams pushed to their absolute limits.\nBy Mark Savage, music correspondent\n\"This album is going to get terrible reviews,\" Self Esteem predicted when I caught up with her last Christmas.\nWhy? \"Because people hate women doing well,\" she laughed. \"I'm very ready for a male journalist to say it doesn't make sense, because it's a lot.\"\nThat's kind of the point, though. Out on Friday, A Complicated Woman is an attempt to capture womanhood in all its complexities and contradictions \u2013 and that means moving through musical genres, modes and attitudes with almost whiplash-inducing speed.\nBut Self Esteem, aka Rebecca Lucy Taylor, is too clever to mess it up. Her trademark wit and sincerity are firmly in place, as she talks candidly about social anxiety, crises of confidence, infantilised men, her least favourite sexual positions and being beaten down for speaking up.\nHighlights include The Curse, a stadium-sized ballad about using alcohol as an emotional crutch; and closing track The Deep Blue Okay, where she eventually finds a modicum of inner peace. Along the way, there are guest appearances from Nadine Shah, Moonchild Sanelly and even Coronation Street's Julie Hesmondhalgh.\nShe launched the album with a flashy West End residency last week \u2013 where fans were delighted to discover that A Complicated Woman was an uncomplicated delight.\nLuigi Mangione's case went viral after he was charged with killing healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in New York City in December.\nHe has pleaded not guilty to state charges, and has yet to enter a plea for separate federal charges.\nSome on social media have celebrated the 26-year-old, and shared anger at America's private health insurers.\nSo what are the facts, and what are the conspiracies?\nThe Mangione Trial, on BBC Sounds, aims to unpick this. The latest episode drops on Wednesday, and looks at how the US healthcare system works.\nIt hears from a mother who says she spent $40,000 (\u00a330,000) on her daughter's treatment while also battling for her insurance to cover it.\nFuture episodes will dive into what conspiracy theories are, and why people become so obsessed with them.\nBy Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter\nDark fantasy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, out Thursday for PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Game Pass, quite literally caught people's eyes when it was first revealed at last year's Summer Game Fest.\nAs video games go, it's a stunner, with gorgeous art direction heavily inspired by France's 19th century Belle \u00c9poque era.\nPlayers control a crew of characters on a quest to destroy the Paintress \u2013 a being who emerges once a year and scrawls a number onto a monolith. If someone's age matches the digits, they die (hence the 33 in the title).\nSomehow, the 30-person team at French developer Sandfall Interactive has also managed to attract some top-tier acting talent to the role-playing game (RPG) project, including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Gollum actor Andy Serkis, Final Fantasy XVI's Ben Starr and Baldur's Gate 3's Jennifer English.\nBut the thing that's arguably generated most excitement is the game's focus on old-school turn-based combat. It was a staple of classic 1990s and early 2000s RPG series such as Final Fantasy that's fallen out of fashion in the blockbuster space of late. If the studio sticks the landing with their debut title, expect to hear about Expedition 33 when Game of the Year season rolls around.\nIf that doesn't take your fancy, video game adaptation Until Dawn is out in cinemas on Friday. Passionate fans of the 2015 \"interactive horror movie\" were concerned when the first trailer revealed the film's makers had swapped the game's trademark choose-your-own-adventure device for a Happy Death Day-style time loop.\nBut with Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation director David F Sandberg and prolific horror writer Gary Dauberman on board, and a buzzy cast including Love, Victor star Michael Cimino and up-and-comer Ella Rubin, Until Dawn's fate isn't necessarily sealed yet.",

They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.\nThe IDF also confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic it had detained following the incident.

        "article_text": "Max Verstappen started the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix from pole position\nMax Verstappen refused to discuss his unhappiness with a penalty he was given in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because he was concerned about retribution from Formula 1's governing body the FIA.\nThe four-time champion's five-second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage in a first-corner battle with McLaren's Oscar Piastri potentially cost him the race win to the Australian.\nVerstappen said: \"You can't share your opinion because it's not appreciated apparently, or people can't handle the full truth. Honestly, it's better if I don't say too much.\n\"It's honestly just how everything is becoming. Everyone is super-sensitive about everything. And what we have (in the rules) currently, we cannot be critical anyway. So less talking \u2013 even better for me.\"\nVerstappen's comments are a reference to a change in the FIA's rule book over the winter that codified a series of penalties for drivers who either repeatedly swear or criticise the governing body. \nThese were introduced at the behest of FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem and can lead to a one-month ban plus deduction of championship points.\nThe changes were introduced after drivers' swearing in news conferences last year led to controversial penalties. \nVerstappen had to do a motorsport equivalent of community service for using a swear word in a news conference at the Singapore Grand Prix. And Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fined for doing the same in Las Vegas.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nPiastri wins in Saudi Arabia and takes title lead\nChequered Flag podcast: Saudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nVerstappen said in the official news conference in Jeddah on Sunday: \"I cannot swear in here, but at the same time, you also can't be critical in any form that might 'harm' or 'danger'... Let me get the sheet out. There's a lot of lines, you know?\n\"So that's why it's better not to talk about it \u2013 you can put yourself in trouble, and I don't think anyone wants that.\"\nWhen it was put to him that being less expansive than previously had seemed to be a trend from him already this season, he said: \"It has to do with social media in general, and how the world is. I prefer not to talk a lot because sometimes your words can be twisted or people interpret it in a different way. It's honestly better not to say too much.\"\nThe phrase in the FIA sporting code to which Verstappen is referring forbids \"any words, deeds or writings that have caused moral injury or loss to the FIA, its bodies, its members or its executive officers, and more generally on the interest of motor sport and on the values defended by the FIA\".\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side\nVerstappen's radio messages during the race clearly indicated he did not approve of the penalty he was given, but he was warned to keep his thoughts to himself.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said he felt the penalty was \"very harsh\" and asked rhetorically: \"Whatever happened to 'let them race on the first lap?' That just seems to have been abandoned.\"\nThe stewards' verdict contained an answer to that - it said that the normal penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage was 10 seconds, but they reduced it to five because it was the first lap.\nVerstappen was penalised for cutting the chicane after the start and keeping the lead.\nPiastri had got fully alongside him on the inside on the entry to the first corner. Despite this, Verstappen cut the second part of the chicane and retained the lead.\nF1's driving standards guidelines effectively say that the corner was Piastri's in that situation.\nThey say that for a driver overtaking on the inside to be \"entitled to be given room (his car) must have its front axle at least alongside the mirror of the other car prior to and at the apex, be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex and not have 'dived in''; and in the stewards' estimation have taken a reasonable racing line and been able to complete the move while remaining within track limits.\"\nPiastri comfortably complied with all these criteria.\nHe said: \"The stewards had to get involved, but I thought I was plenty far enough up (alongside) and in the end that's what got me the race.\n\"I knew that I had enough of my car alongside to take the corner. We obviously both braked extremely late. For me, I braked as late as I could while staying on the track. And I think how it unfolded is how it should have been dealt with.\"\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"Oscar, thanks to a very good launch off the grid, and thanks to positioning the car on the inside, [was] slightly ahead of Max, managing to keep the car within the track limits, then he gained the rights (to the corner), and obviously in that situation you can't overtake off track.\n\"This is a clear case. It shouldn't create any polemic, really.\"\nVerstappen led until the first pit stops, when he served the penalty and dropped behind Piastri, who controlled the race from there to take his third win in five grands prix this season.\nIt included a bold move around the outside of Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari on the approach to the high-speed Turns 22 and 23 at a critical point of the race, to minimise his time loss on the lap Verstappen stopped.\nVerstappen had shown strong pace in the first stint, tracked closely by the McLaren, and was pulling away slightly by the time Piastri made his stop on lap 19.\nOnce into the lead, Piastri controlled the race but was unable to extend the gap to Verstappen despite having the advantage of clean air.\nThe win put him into the lead of the championship for the first time in his short career - Piastri made his debut only in 2023. He is 10 points ahead of team-mate Lando Norris, with Verstappen a further two adrift.\nThe 24-year-old's performance has impressed Verstappen.\n\"He's very solid,\" Verstappen said. \"He's very calm in his approach, and I like that. It shows on track. He delivers when he has to, barely makes mistakes \u2013 and that's what you need when you want to fight for a championship.\"\nThe Dutchman also had praise for the influence of Piastri's manager, the former F1 driver Mark Webber.\n\"With Mark by his side, he's helping him a lot,\" Verstappen said. \"It's great.\n\"People learn from their own careers. That's what I had with my dad, and Mark is advising Oscar. At the end of the day, Oscar is using his talent, and that's great to see.\"\nLando Norris won the season opener in Australia\nPiastri was overshadowed by Norris in 2024, but has been the more impressive of the McLaren drivers since the start of this season.\nNorris, who fought back from 10th on the grid after a crash in qualifying to finish fourth, just nine seconds behind Piastri, admitted after the race that he needs to \"chill out a little bit\" and that he was \"not surprised\" he had lost the championship lead.\nHis crash in qualifying was his biggest mistake of the season but it comes after a series of small errors, usually in qualifying, that have harmed his chances in races since he won the season-opening grand prix in Australia from pole position.\n\"I have been very confident in my race, it's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute,\" Norris said.\n\"That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car. Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\n\"I make my life too tough on Saturday. So it makes my Sundays a little more fun at times but I miss out on a few trophies. I have to work on my Saturdays and if I do that I am confident I can get back to where I was.\"\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions",

        "article_text": "Leicester have been relegated from the Premier League after defeat to Liverpool \nThe banner flown over the King Power Stadium made its point. \n'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool.\nA second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwards as Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winner put the visitors within three points of the Premier League title.\nIt has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. \nThe drop had been coming - Leicester have won just once since December - and there was an air of resignation around the ground, even before Alexander-Arnold's strike. \nThere are unhappy and disconnected fans, players accused of giving up, and a manager in Ruud van Nistelrooy who, despite his pedigree as a player, has seen the Foxes get worse on his watch. \nThere were some boos at full-time, but the majority of home fans had already left. Those who stayed offered a smattering of applause, yet it was an empty gesture.\nIt reflected a club in need of a rebuild but how, and with who, are the biggest questions as Leicester - champions of England nine years ago - face one of their biggest crossroads.\nLeicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold moves Liverpool closer to title\n'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\n'My responsibility to lead the club in the best way' - Nistelrooy\nWhen the Foxes sacked Steve Cooper in October they were 16th, although the cracks were there.\nThe teething problems in moving away from Enzo Maresca's style - less expansive and working the ball quicker - were just part of the issue. \nThe departed Maresca, who led them to the Championship title last season before joining Chelsea, was well-liked by the squad and Cooper struggled to connect with players, even if some of the senior members of the squad - including Jamie Vardy - were onside. \nThere was growing concern from the club that any disconnect would impact their survival prospects, and one of the reasons why they dismissed Cooper. \nSo, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.\nFormer Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.\nYet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.\nThey have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.\nThe Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. \nThat is in stark contrast to the lack of goals under Van Nistelrooy - a revered striker for Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Netherlands - and they have scored just six times in the league since the draw with Brighton on 8 December.\nAnother goalless outing against Liverpool extended the home goal drought to nine league games and 810 minutes - the worst in top-flight history.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"They have some big decisions to make. It has been awful for them. They have been miles off it.\"\nSome players have recently raised concerns over the standard and intensity of training with the drop-off being connected to Leicester's impending relegation, which was becoming increasingly inevitable.\nThe fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks - Van Nistelrooy has dropped him for the last four games for refusing to agree to stay at the training ground one night a week - emphasises the growing tensions. \nWhen asked about whether he had been able to improve the standards and culture in his five months at the club, Van Nistelrooy was clear.\n\"When you don't combine them with results it's always hard. There's no negotiation on these standards and I hold everyone accountable on those,\" the Dutchman said this month. \n\"I know how I worked from a village of 5,000 people in the middle of nowhere to Manchester United and Real Madrid. I know what is necessary to stay at the highest level and I know there are so many people working at this football club who have the quality to do so. But not enough yet. \n\"In difficult moments you get to know people and characters very well. I speak about standards and what is needed to perform at the highest level and that's a culture which needs to be created in this club.\"\nDefender Conor Coady has been one trying to raise spirits at the club's Seagrave training base, but it has been an almost impossible task with results - and he admitted Leicester have not been good enough. \n\"We've took a bit of stick and we'll continue to take stick because it's deserved,\" said the former England centre-back. \"From minute one this season, we haven't been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it'll chew you up and spit you out.\"\nSusan Whelan, Jon Rudkin and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha watched Leicester's defeat to Liverpool\nAs the plane's banner suggested, director of football Jon Rudkin and the board have been the target for fans this season.\nThey see Rudkin as a root cause of their decline in recent seasons. He was, of course, in the same position when the Foxes stunned the world to win the Premier League in 2016, but supporters have made up their minds. \nIt does not help that the hierarchy rarely speak publicly, allowing supporters to understand and digest the situation.\nChief executive Susan Whelan twice met with the Foxes Trust and the club's Fan Advisory Board in February for candid and constructive meetings but the wider fanbase remain disconnected.\nDoes chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha decide to make a change at the top, does head of recruitment Martyn Glover's position come under more scrutiny following a number of poor transfer windows, regardless of financial constraints?\nVan Nistelrooy's position remains a doubt and it is hard to see a long-term future in the wake of damning statistics. \nDefeat against Liverpool leaves him with the unenviable record of having lost 17 of his 22 games, winning just three. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?\nVan Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.\n\"It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there.\n\"The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it. In a situation like this you have to sit very carefully with the club to discuss the matters.\"\nYet sacking a second manager of the season has financial consequences and with money tight, it will be a consideration. Can Leicester financially afford to sack Van Nistelrooy but, going forward, can they afford not to?\nThere is also an acceptance the squad needs a reset but only three players are out of contract - goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, and 38-year-old captain Jamie Vardy. \nWhat happens with Vardy - influential at the club as their last remaining title winner and the scorer of 198 goals - remains open, but it's the biggest decision the club has to make in terms of the squad given his reputation and achievements.\nIt means Leicester must shift big earners to make wholesale changes to a squad which has, in the main, brought them down twice.\nWilfred Ndidi signed a new three-year contract last summer but his appetite for another Championship campaign is likely to have waned and the same will go for defenders Ricardo Pereira and Wout Faes. Although, as part of Leicester's decline, they must find takers.\nGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been a rare bright spot and will have his admirers, as will Bilal El Khannouss, despite an underwhelming first season in England, while Winks' situation could depend on Van Nistelrooy's exit. \nLike every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.\nLeicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.\nYet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float.  \nFor now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with.\nThey made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. This time their short-term future is far less certain.",

        "summary": "For now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with.They made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. 'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool.A second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwards as Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winner put the visitors within three points of the Premier League title.It has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. So, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.Former Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.Yet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.They have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.The Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games.

        "article_text": "On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring an emergency at the US southern border and directed his top officials to evaluate whether to invoke a rarely used 19th-century law in response to immigration concerns.\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807 allows the president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the US. \nUS media report that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem, who were tasked with the assessment, will announce their recommendations later this week.\nSince returning to office, Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a central focus, and border crossings have reached a quarter-century low. But the  statute could further expand the president's powers. \nHere's what to know.\nThe 19th-century law would allow the use of active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties within the US.\nThis includes the National Guard - a branch of the US armed forces traditionally reserved for domestic emergencies and disasters. \nUS presidents can invoke the law if they determine that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" against the government make it \"impracticable to enforce\" US law \"by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings\". \nOnce invoked, troops could be tasked with a range of duties, from quelling civil unrest and enforcing court orders to arresting and detaining migrants.\nBecause the Insurrection Act was written in broad terms, with little specific guidance on how and when the powers can be used, it gives presidents wide latitude in deciding when to mobilise military personnel for domestic operations.\nThroughout his election campaign, Trump vowed to crackdown on illegal immigration, calling the southern border situation a \"national emergency\" that could be better tamed by invoking the 19th-century statute.\nOn his first day in office in January, he asked for \"recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807\".\nThe administration has already rolled out a series of sweeping measures targeting the border. These include a nationwide deportation sweep and the controversial move to transfer alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador - a decision now facing legal challenges.\nThis comes as US Border Patrol has recorded just 8,300 migrant apprehensions, marking the lowest number of border crossings since 2000.\n\nThe Insurrection Act has been invoked a handful of times in American history. \nAbraham Lincoln used it when the southern states rebelled during the US Civil War, and former President Ulysses S Grant invoked it against a wave of racist violence by the Ku Klux Klan after the war.\nIn the 20th century, former President Dwight D Eisenhower invoked it so the US Army would escort black students into their high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, after the state's governor refused to comply with a federal desegregation order.\nMore recently, it was used in 1992 when massive riots broke out in Los Angeles over the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a black man. Then-President George Bush sent in active-duty members of the Marines and Army as well as National Guard troops.\nThe US government has traditionally worked to limit the use of military force on American soil, especially against its own citizens.\nThe Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 was enacted to restrict the military from acting as domestic law enforcement. In times of unrest, states typically deploy the National Guard to help maintain order.\nSince returning to office, Trump has expanded his authority by declaring national emergencies - a move that grants the presidency access to powers and resources that are normally restricted. He has used this authority to impose tariffs and, more controversially, to take action on immigration.\nIn March, following his emergency declaration at the border, Trump invoked the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport migrants he alleged were gang members.  Earlier this month, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked that effort.\nIf Trump chooses to invoke the Insurrection Act, it remains unclear what legal challenges he might face.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer.\nThe controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages.\n\"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\"\nWhite House officials have played down reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it.\nTrump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary.\n\"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media,\" he said. \"Try finding something new,\" he said. \nTrump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea  also floated by Hegseth earlier on Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".\nHegseth did not directly respond to reports of a second Signal chat, which were initially covered by the New York Times.\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.\nThe messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times. But it too appeared to share details of military operations against Yemen.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nAlthough the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents. Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices.\nThe second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth criticised the media and denounced the reports. He also said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\".\nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, the top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said the \"Trump-hating media\" was  \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nUS air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.",

Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices.EPAHegseth and his wife Jennifer Rauchet, who reportedly was part of the second Signal chat, attended the White House Easter egg rollFive takeaways from first leaked US military chat groupPentagon watchdog probing Hegseth's Signal app useFour lingering questions about 'Signalgate'What is messaging app Signal and how secure is it?The second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).Hegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".In a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired. Although the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel.Signal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents.",

        "article_text": "Russia's ceasefire in Ukraine lasted only 30 hours, and even then it appears to have been very limited in scope, with accusations of violations on both sides.\nKyiv said there had been no \"air raids alerts\" on Sunday during Vladimir Putin's \"Easter truce\" and President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested this could be the \"easiest\" format to extend for 30 days and possibly more.\nThe US had tried to organise a 30-day ceasefire but that never took hold, and this latest chapter underscores the difficulty in achieving even a brief pause in fighting,\nRussia insisted on a number of conditions, including a halt to Ukraine re-arming and recruiting new fighters as well as \"underlying causes of the conflict\".\nOne major factor hampering the talks' progress is the long history of broken ceasefire deals, resulting in deep mistrust between the two neighbours.\nDuring his tempestuous meeting with Donald Trump in February, Zelensky accused Russia of violating 25 ceasefire agreements since 2014, and argued that no such deal would hold without security guarantees.\nIn turn, Russia accuses the Ukrainian president of being \"incapable\" of implementing any such agreements.\nIndependent experts say Russia bears the brunt of the blame for broken truces, even though Ukraine bears some responsibility, too.\nStatements by current and former Russian officials also indicate that Moscow would be prepared to cease hostilities, only if its original objectives are achieved - namely a demilitarised, neutral and non-nuclear Ukraine.\nBy invading Ukraine in 2014, Russia violated the Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the two countries signed in 1997. Article 2 said the sides \"respect each other's territorial integrity and confirm the inviolability of existing borders between them\".\nThe war has been rife with accusations of treachery from the very beginning. \nGen Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of Ukraine's General Staff at the time, accuses Russia of going back on agreements allowing Ukrainian troops to pull out from the eastern town of Ilovaysk in August 2014. \nAs a result, withdrawing convoys came under fire, and at least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed.\nThe first major ceasefire agreement, signed on 5 September 2014 in Minsk, was broken within hours of being signed, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport. Attacks on other Ukrainian towns in the region, such as Debaltseve, continued, too.\nThis prompted the second attempted truce, known as Minsk-2, but it was even shorter. \nWithin minutes of it going into effect on 15 February 2015, observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported mortar and artillery fire in Donetsk. They were deployed to the war zone at Ukraine's request to monitor the security situation including any ceasefire violations, but they did not explicitly say who committed them.\nWhat followed was a string of other failed ceasefire attempts. Again, some were broken within minutes of coming into force.\nThey included Easter truces in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the \"school ceasefires\" of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 which were meant to allow schoolchildren near the frontline to go back to school in September, Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the \"bread ceasefires\" of 2017, 2018 and 2019 to allow the harvesting of grain, and others.\nA \"comprehensive ceasefire\" that went into effect on 27 July 2020 only lasted 20 minutes, according to Kyiv. Still, it had an effect on the fighting, halving the number of fatalities among Ukrainian soldiers in the following year.\nMatthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, argues that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith.\n\"Russia has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives,\" he says.\nBecause of various ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and Russia, \"the level of fighting has ebbed and flowed, and Ukraine bears some responsibility for part of that\", he tells the BBC. \n\"But the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat, and that informs things.\"\nJohn Herbst, a former US ambassador to Kyiv who now works for the Washington-based think-tank Atlantic Council, argues that Russia, not Ukraine was the \"serial violator\" of the Minsk ceasefire accords, the first and still one of the most comprehensive attempts to broker a truce in Ukraine.\nVerifying claims of ceasefire violations is not easy because almost all independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.\nBBC journalist Olga Ivshina, who was on the ground in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region reporting about the earlier stages of the war, says there were reports of Ukraine retaking villages in 2016-19, a successful Ukrainian offensive outside Mariupol, and Ukrainian tanks were spotted too close to the frontline, where they should not have been under the ceasefire deals.\n\"All of these were proclaimed as violations by Moscow. But of course they forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all,\" Ivshina says. \nDespite the Minsk accords, Russian-controlled forces launched an offensive against the town of Debaltseve, claiming that it was not covered by the ceasefire deal.\nZelensky has described the Minsk accords as a \"trap\" for Ukraine which allowed Russia to prepare for the full-scale invasion. \nPutin says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers had intended to implement the Minsk deals. Their fate was sealed when Russia declared the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" - separatist entities it had helped to set up - as independent states.\nPutin's \"Easter truce\" was never more than a lull, but President Trump said \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\".\nSo far there has been no indication that the Kremlin will accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, agreed to by Ukraine. \nTrump has already warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, \"we're just gonna take a pass\" and walk away.\nRussia's demand for \"the underlying causes of the conflict\" to be resolved suggest it has not moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty - through negotiations as well as military means.\nVladislav Surkov, a former close adviser to Vladimir Putin who was known as the \"grey cardinal\" of Russian politics, celebrates the Minsk accords last year as a way of \"legitimising\" Ukraine's initial partition.\nThe very idea of peace, he said, wass \"nothing but a continuation of war by other means\".",

        "article_text": "Leicester have been relegated from the Premier League after defeat to Liverpool \nThe banner flown over the King Power Stadium made its point. \n'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool.\nA second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwards as Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winner put the visitors within three points of the Premier League title.\nIt has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. \nThe drop had been coming - Leicester have won just once since December - and there was an air of resignation around the ground, even before Alexander-Arnold's strike. \nThere are unhappy and disconnected fans, players accused of giving up, and a manager in Ruud van Nistelrooy who, despite his pedigree as a player, has seen the Foxes get worse on his watch. \nThere were some boos at full-time, but the majority of home fans had already left. Those who stayed offered a smattering of applause, yet it was an empty gesture.\nIt reflected a club in need of a rebuild but how, and with who, are the biggest questions as Leicester - champions of England nine years ago - face one of their biggest crossroads.\nLeicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold moves Liverpool closer to title\n'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\n'My responsibility to lead the club in the best way' - Nistelrooy\nWhen the Foxes sacked Steve Cooper in October they were 16th, although the cracks were there.\nThe teething problems in moving away from Enzo Maresca's style - less expansive and working the ball quicker - were just part of the issue. \nThe departed Maresca, who led them to the Championship title last season before joining Chelsea, was well-liked by the squad and Cooper struggled to connect with players, even if some of the senior members of the squad - including Jamie Vardy - were onside. \nThere was growing concern from the club that any disconnect would impact their survival prospects, and one of the reasons why they dismissed Cooper. \nSo, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.\nFormer Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.\nYet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.\nThey have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.\nThe Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. \nThat is in stark contrast to the lack of goals under Van Nistelrooy - a revered striker for Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Netherlands - and they have scored just six times in the league since the draw with Brighton on 8 December.\nAnother goalless outing against Liverpool extended the home goal drought to nine league games and 810 minutes - the worst in top-flight history.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"They have some big decisions to make. It has been awful for them. They have been miles off it.\"\nSome players have recently raised concerns over the standard and intensity of training with the drop-off being connected to Leicester's impending relegation, which was becoming increasingly inevitable.\nThe fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks - Van Nistelrooy has dropped him for the last four games for refusing to agree to stay at the training ground one night a week - emphasises the growing tensions. \nWhen asked about whether he had been able to improve the standards and culture in his five months at the club, Van Nistelrooy was clear.\n\"When you don't combine them with results it's always hard. There's no negotiation on these standards and I hold everyone accountable on those,\" the Dutchman said this month. \n\"I know how I worked from a village of 5,000 people in the middle of nowhere to Manchester United and Real Madrid. I know what is necessary to stay at the highest level and I know there are so many people working at this football club who have the quality to do so. But not enough yet. \n\"In difficult moments you get to know people and characters very well. I speak about standards and what is needed to perform at the highest level and that's a culture which needs to be created in this club.\"\nDefender Conor Coady has been one trying to raise spirits at the club's Seagrave training base, but it has been an almost impossible task with results - and he admitted Leicester have not been good enough. \n\"We've took a bit of stick and we'll continue to take stick because it's deserved,\" said the former England centre-back. \"From minute one this season, we haven't been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it'll chew you up and spit you out.\"\nSusan Whelan, Jon Rudkin and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha watched Leicester's defeat to Liverpool\nAs the plane's banner suggested, director of football Jon Rudkin and the board have been the target for fans this season.\nThey see Rudkin as a root cause of their decline in recent seasons. He was, of course, in the same position when the Foxes stunned the world to win the Premier League in 2016, but supporters have made up their minds. \nIt does not help that the hierarchy rarely speak publicly, allowing supporters to understand and digest the situation.\nChief executive Susan Whelan twice met with the Foxes Trust and the club's Fan Advisory Board in February for candid and constructive meetings but the wider fanbase remain disconnected.\nDoes chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha decide to make a change at the top, does head of recruitment Martyn Glover's position come under more scrutiny following a number of poor transfer windows, regardless of financial constraints?\nVan Nistelrooy's position remains a doubt and it is hard to see a long-term future in the wake of damning statistics. \nDefeat against Liverpool leaves him with the unenviable record of having lost 17 of his 22 games, winning just three. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?\nVan Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.\n\"It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there.\n\"The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it. In a situation like this you have to sit very carefully with the club to discuss the matters.\"\nYet sacking a second manager of the season has financial consequences and with money tight, it will be a consideration. Can Leicester financially afford to sack Van Nistelrooy but, going forward, can they afford not to?\nThere is also an acceptance the squad needs a reset but only three players are out of contract - goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, and 38-year-old captain Jamie Vardy. \nWhat happens with Vardy - influential at the club as their last remaining title winner and the scorer of 198 goals - remains open, but it's the biggest decision the club has to make in terms of the squad given his reputation and achievements.\nIt means Leicester must shift big earners to make wholesale changes to a squad which has, in the main, brought them down twice.\nWilfred Ndidi signed a new three-year contract last summer but his appetite for another Championship campaign is likely to have waned and the same will go for defenders Ricardo Pereira and Wout Faes. Although, as part of Leicester's decline, they must find takers.\nGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been a rare bright spot and will have his admirers, as will Bilal El Khannouss, despite an underwhelming first season in England, while Winks' situation could depend on Van Nistelrooy's exit. \nLike every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.\nLeicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.\nYet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float.  \nFor now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with.\nThey made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. This time their short-term future is far less certain.",

Like every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.Leicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.Yet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?Van Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.",

Kenji Kanasugi, Japan's ambassador to China said Zhong had requested to speak to the victim's family, but did not say if he had been targeting Japanese nationals.\nThe incident has also shone a light on the unchecked nationalism on Chinese social media, which has fuelled anti-foreigner sentiment in recent years.\nOnline commentators noted that the schoolboy's killing had happened on a politically sensitive date - 18 September, the anniversary of an incident that led to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in China in the early 1930s.\nHistorical grievances have long overshadowed political tensions between China and Japan. China has long demanded an apology from Japan for its colonial and wartime aggression in the early and mid 20 Century. It has also accused Japan of glossing over its brutal military actions in China in its history textbooks. \nThe stabbing also came amid a spate of high-profile attacks on foreigners in China, including the stabbing of four American teachers in Jilin.\nLast June, a man attacked a Japanese mother and her child at a bus stop in Suzhou but ended up killing a Chinese woman trying to protect them.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nWatch Benn train for Eubank fight\nConor Benn begins his day at 5am with laborious sprints up a precipitous path in the idyllic yet built-up setting of Palma, Mallorca.\nWith the sun not set to rise for another two and half hours, the streets are deserted.\n\"I'm just making things as difficult as I can so come fight night it's as easy as it can be. This is where the champions are made,\" the Briton says through a heavy breath.\nThe 28-year-old will finally face bitter rival Chris Eubank Jr at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday.\nThey were scheduled to fight in October 2022 \u2013 almost 30 years after their fathers' iconic duels - but the bout was called off on two days' notice because of Benn's failed drug test.\nBenn has always maintained innocence and after a two-and-a-half-year legal battle, he has been cleared to fight.\n\"I hit a bit of adversity, came through it, just about, and am ready to go into the biggest fight of my career,\" Benn tells BBC Sport.\nYet the reasons why and how the fertility drug Clomifene entered his body remain a mystery.\nWhen once we wondered if he could step out of his legendary father's monstrous shadow, now it is the unshakable shadow of his failed drugs test which will, most probably, forever loom over the British welterweight.\nInside 934 days of Eubank-Benn bitterness and chaos\nEubank v Benn - fight week begins\nEubank v Benn - all you need to know\nThis video can not be played\nRe-live the epic Eubank v Benn world title fight in 1990\nNigel Benn lost to fellow British boxing legend Chris Eubank Sr in 1990 before a contentious draw three years later.\nMore than three decades on, he is by his son's side as the jovial pair joke with the team. It's a real family affair, with Benn's sisters and cousin also joining him in camp.\nHaving spent 12 years of his childhood in Mallorca, Benn speaks fluent Spanish to the locals in the gym.\nWhen the training session begins, however, the laughter stops. There is noticeable shift in mindset \u2013 a sign of just how serious Benn is approaching this fight.\nHe says he is \"leaving no stone unturned\" as he fights for the family name \u2013 and to prove his own worth - in this bloodline rivalry.\n\"I've got a chip on my shoulder about [people] saying I'm the nepo kid, that I had it easy,\" he adds.\nBut this is no longer about fathers. Benn's reputation amongst boxing fans has been stained.\nAlthough he has been cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, they feel he should be more transparent about the reasons behind the failed test.\nBenn says he has been \"cleared three times\" and is reluctant to dwell on the past. \nNigel, meanwhile, speaks more openly about the impact it had on them both, saying \u00a31m was spent on the legal battles.\nThe former super-middleweight champion says he is not a drinker but would consume \"half a bottle of red wine every night\" during the period as his mental health issues worsened, while his son turned to therapy to get through the dark times.\n\"I was watching my son really crying in my arms, heartbroken. I just knew [he was innocent],\" Nigel adds.\n\"Because [if he was] I would let the public know, I'd say, 'Mate, yeah, sorry mate, he's done this'. But I know he hasn't and I will stand with my son.\"\nNigel Benn was a two-weight world champion during his boxing career\nBenn taps into modern-day training methods by sporting an oxygen mask during cardio to simulate high-altitude training.\nHe expertly talks about nutrition, saying in the past he was \"eating curries and pop-tarts\" after weigh-ins.\nThere is something quite comical about the way he unintentionally reels his past takeaway order in the style of Smithy from sitcom Gavin and Stacey.\n\"I'd have prawn puri for starters, lamb rogan josh, Bombay potatoes with some saag aloo, peshwari naan, all the poppadoms, pilau rice, saag paneer,\" Benn says.\nThere is no doubt he is now living the life of an elite athlete.\nBut so much has happened outside of the ring that we have forgotten, or perhaps never had the opportunity to truly find out, how good a boxer Benn actually is. \nBefore his ban, he was on a roll with early stoppage victories over past-their-prime Chris Algieri and Chris van Heerden.\nHis two fights in America since the cancelled Eubank bout \u2013 points wins over Rodolfo Orozco and Peter Dobson - have been rather unspectacular.\nBenn is a vastly improved fighter from the novice dropped by French journeyman Cedrick Peynaud in 2017.\nHowever, with around 20 amateur bouts in Australia before he turned pro, how costly has the time out of the ring \u2013 not to mention the mental scars inflicted by the doping scandal \u2013 been on Benn's boxing apprenticeship?\nBenn has been sparring the likes of IBF super-middleweight champion William Scull and undefeated middleweight Bruno Surace.\nNigel raves enthusiastically about a particularly \"mind-blowing\" sparring session against an unnamed top-level fighter which left him too excited to sleep.\n\"I'm 99% sure he will [beat Eubank] within four rounds,\" Nigel predicts.\nIs this a case of rose-tinted dad glasses or an unbiased analysis from one of the best British fighters ever?\nWorld-title challenger Eubank has fought at a significantly higher level. Although a stipulation prevents Eubank from gaining more than 10lb on fight night, he is still the more natural at the weight. \n\"Yes, I am jumping up two weight divisions. Yes, that brings its challenges,\" Benn says.\n\"And yes his CV's better, but the difference between me and him is he's lost every time he stepped up. I haven't.\"\nBenn believes that \"people see this as a 50/50\" contest, even though Eubank is the bookmakers' favourite.\n\"I must be delusional or people just don't know what they're dealing with,\" he says.\n\"Because I see it being a one-sided beatdown. I see it being so ferocious, so dangerous that people are wincing as I'm landing my shots.\n\"I can't see it any other way.\"\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.\nIt also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.\nThe College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.\nWith 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.\nFor the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European. \nAnd although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".\nFor those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.\nCould the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?\nHere are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.\nNationality: Italian\nAge: 70\nSoftly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.\nHaving acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.\nHe is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.\nBut he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".\nThe bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"\nSome 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.\nNationality: Filipino\nAge: 67\nCould the next pope come from Asia?\nCardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.\nThe Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.\nHe is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.\nHe has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.\nBut in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.\nThe cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.\nAsked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"\nNationality: Congolese\nAge: 65\nIt's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\nHe has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.\nHe is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".\nThough Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.\nBut in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"\nSuch comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.\nNationality: Ghanaian\nAge: 76\nIf chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.\nLike Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.\nAsked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".\nHe was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.\nLike Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.\nA guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.\nLike many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.\nIn a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.\nIn 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.\nNationality: Hungarian\nAge: 72\nA cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.\nHe is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.\nThe archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.\nErdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.\nHis conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.\nNationality: Italian\nAge: 83\nOnly cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.\nThe former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.\nHis name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".\nFrancis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.\nNationality: German\nAge: 71\nGermany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.\nThe Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.\nHe has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.\nBut in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.\nTwo years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.\nNationality: Canadian\nAge: 80\nCardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.\nFor years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.\nAs another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.\nOuellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.\nHe opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".\nNationality: American\nAge: 69\nCould the papacy go to an American for the first time?\nChicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.\nTwo years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.\nHe worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.\nPrevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.\nHe is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.\nNationality: Guinean\nAge: 79\nWell-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.\nThe son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.\nHe has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.\nWhile not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.\nNationality: Canadian\nAge: 78\nCardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.\nAlthough he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.\nHe has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.\nCzerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.\nAlthough a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",

        "article_text": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z are one of the world's most famous power couples.\nAnd they now have an equally famous family, with daughter Blue Ivy, 13, and seven-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir.\nBut Beyonc\u00e9's mother, businesswoman and fashion designer Tina Knowles, tells me she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.\n\"If I had my first choice, they would not have to deal with the things that they have to deal with as kids,\" she says.\nKnowles, 71, says for now, the children are not too exposed to it.\n\"But one day they'll read the ignorance that people put out there about them, the lies and all of that,\" she says. \"And I do worry about that.\"\nDespite those pressures, she says Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z - who are notoriously private about their home life - are doing an \"amazing\" job as parents.\n\"The truth is they spend abnormal amount of time with their children and they have great relationships with their kids,\" she says.\n\"And they're just great parents. I don't think you could ask for better parents.\"\nKnowles is speaking to BBC News ahead of the publication of her new memoir, Matriarch.\nIt covers her childhood in Texas, her daughters' rise to fame and her later years, as a grandmother.\nKnowles now has four grandchildren, including Julez Smith, the son of her younger daughter, singer-songwriter Solange. She also considers herself a grandmother to former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland's children.\nShe says that she sees all her grandchildren regularly, describing them as \"one of the biggest joys in my life\".\n\"[Blue Ivy and I] have a very close bond,\" she says of her eldest granddaughter.\n\"I'm so happy that she feels like she can talk to me,\" she says, adding that Blue Ivy is always giving her advice about taking care of herself.\n\"She's my beauty guru. She's my manager,\" she says.\nI'm intrigued by this, and ask why she calls the 13-year-old her manager.\n\"Well, I don't call her my manager. Everybody else calls her my manager, because she's bossy. She's a little Capricorn like me. So we have that bond.\"\nKnowles grew up in 50s and 60s Galveston, the youngest of seven.\nIn her book, she talks about the harassment her family faced, including from the police.\n\"There was a lot of racial tension,\" she tells me. \"And I think some things have changed, but I still think that black people are more susceptible to police brutality [and] being stopped.\"\nShe met her now ex-husband, Mathew Knowles, in Houston and the pair went on to have two daughters, Beyonc\u00e9 in 1981 and Solange five years later.\nBeyonc\u00e9, she writes, was \"not an easy baby\". Nursery rhymes did not cut it (\"she cried louder\" to drown out Mary Had A Little Lamb), but jazz music would soothe her.\nAs a child, Solange was a \u201csocial butterfly\u201d but Beyonc\u00e9 was shy. \"She walked into every classroom trying to be invisible,\" Knowles writes.\nShe says at the time, her daughters - and all little black girls - were being \"bombarded\" by messages from mainstream culture that they were \"less than\".\nBut Beyonc\u00e9 was always singing, and Solange's talent emerged early on too.\n\"I knew Beyonc\u00e9 had a very beautiful voice, but I didn't know how talented she was until she was seven,\" Knowles tells me.\n\"And Solange probably four, because she just grew up around nothing but music and performances. So she was a lot earlier.\"\nKnowles is adamant that she didn't push her daughters into the music industry.\n\"Absolutely not. This was not my first choice for my girls. They just lived and breathed music,\" she says.\n\"It is their decision. They were born to be entertainers.\"\nNone of them - including Kelly Rowland, who moved in with the family - were very rebellious, she says. All they wanted to do was sing, dance and perform.\n\"I wanted them to have that experience of teenage life and going out to parties and having fun, but I had to force them to do that,\" she says.\nIn the 1990s, the girl group Destiny's Child was formed. It originally comprised Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, but the final line-up was a trio - Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Michelle Williams.\nThe band achieved worldwide fame with mega hits such as Bills, Bills, Bills, Say My Name and Jumpin', Jumpin'.\nKnowles, who ran a hair salon Headliners and had learned dressmaking, made costumes for the group, while Mathew Knowles quit his job to manage them.\nTheir daughters have gone on to forge hugely successful solo careers.\nSolange won a Grammy Award for Cranes in the Sky, while Beyonc\u00e9 has had countless hits including Single Ladies, Crazy in Love, Halo and Irreplaceable.\nShe finally won best album at this year's Grammy Awards - correcting what was widely seen as an historic wrong.\nThe star was recognised for her eighth album, Cowboy Carter, which celebrates and contextualises the black roots of country music.\nIn an Instagram post ahead of her album launch, Beyonc\u00e9 said Cowboy Carter was \"born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcome\" that prompted her to take \"a deeper dive into the history of country\".\nMany interpreted that as a reference to her treatment at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where her performance of Daddy Lessons with The Chicks led to a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.\nKnowles says Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s childhood, growing up in Texas and spending time in Louisiana, influenced her music.\n\"She was very influenced by [Zydeco, a music genre from Louisiana], and that culture and cowboy culture,\" she says.\nShe added it was \"interesting\" to hear some saying Beyonc\u00e9 is \"not country Western\" and shouldn't be making that kind of music.\n\"It is in her. It\u2019s in her right to make whatever music she feels like making.\"\nAs her daughters rose to international fame, they have had to deal with media pressure and trolling - including, Knowles writes, the speculation that Beyonc\u00e9 was faking her pregnancy with Blue Ivy.\nThere was also an infamous argument between Solange and her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator in 2014, which was leaked by celebrity site TMZ.\nKnowles refuses to be drawn on the lift incident.\nBut when asked how she protects her daughters from comments and trolling online, she says it's actually them who protect her.\n\u201cThey are very astute at blocking out the bull and the lies.

Last year, she voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King, and she also performed alongside her mother on her Renaissance tour.\nBut Knowles says that's something Blue Ivy had to \"work for\".\n\"Because her mum was like, no, you got time. You got to make sure that, you know, a lot comes with that.\n\"And so if anything, they're being nurtured to be the best human beings they can be. That's first priority.\"\nAs for whether we can expect Matriarch to be adapted into a reality series, Knowles is reticent.\n\"Oh, not a reality series, but you know, I have been talking to people about the movie rights to it and I would love to see a film made,\" she says.\n\"One of my favourite films is the Jacksons' story.

His family and attorneys have fiercely denied he is a member of MS-13. \nVan Hollen said he was initially blocked from meeting Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by Salvadoran authorities. Later, he said government officials helped facilitate a meeting and Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was brought to the senator's hotel.\n\"His conversation with me was the first communication that he had with anybody outside of prison since he was abducted,\" Van Hollen said.\n\"He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes.\"\nVan Hollen added that conditions in the new prison, in the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana, were better.\n\"He still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world,\" Van Hollen said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's case is part of a simmering showdown between the Trump administration and the US courts system on the issue of immigration. \nA separate feud has been brewing after a judge said he could hold the Trump administration in contempt for its \"wilful disregard\" of his order barring deportation flights. \nMultiple judges - including a unanimous US Supreme Court ruling - said the government should facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return to the US. But the White House has insisted the Maryland man will \"never\" live in the US again.\n\"If he [Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda] ever ends up back in the United States, he would immediately be deported again,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters at the White House Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was \"not a very innocent guy\".\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has faced at least two other allegations of criminal activity, neither of which resulted in a conviction.\nHis wife alleged in a 2021 protective order request that he'd physically attacked her on multiple occasions, according to documents shared by the US Department of Homeland Security.\nJennifer Vasquez Sura decided not to follow through with the court process, saying she and her husband were \"able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counselling\".\nA separate incident was reported in 2022, when Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was pulled over in Tennessee for allegedly speeding. \nAn officer speculated that he was involved in human trafficking, due to him having multiple people in the car and telling authorities he'd been travelling from Texas to Maryland, according to information shared by the Department of Homeland Security that was obtained by the BBC's partner CBS. \nNo criminal case was launched from the incident. His wife said he \"worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites\". \nAt the heart of the case, though, are the allegations of his involvement in MS-13, which the Trump administration used to expel him under the Alien Enemies Act.\nThe president has evoked the law to deport hundreds so far, by arguing the alleged gang members were terrorists. \nSen Van Hollen said the Trump administration wants to \"flat out lie about what this case is about\". \n\"If you want to make claims about \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, you should present them in the courts, not on social media,\" he said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was arrested by immigration authorities on 12 March in Baltimore, before being deported from Texas to El Salvador on 15 March.

        "article_text": "Pope Francis, who has died aged 88, made his final public appearance on Easter Sunday at the Vatican's St Peter's Square. \nAfter wishing the gathered crowd of more than 20,000 a happy Easter, he indicated that Archbishop Diego Ravelli, master of liturgical ceremonies, would read a message he had written.\nHere is the full text of his final public address, as released by the Vatican.\n\n\"Christ is risen, alleluia!\nDear brothers and sisters, Happy Easter!\nToday at last, the singing of the 'alleluia' is heard once more in the Church, passing from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart, and this makes the people of God throughout the world shed tears of joy.\nFrom the empty tomb in Jerusalem, we hear unexpected good news: Jesus, who was crucified, 'is not here, he has risen' (Lk 24:5). Jesus is not in the tomb, he is alive!\nLove has triumphed over hatred, light over darkness and truth over falsehood. Forgiveness has triumphed over revenge. Evil has not disappeared from history; it will remain until the end, but it no longer has the upper hand; it no longer has power over those who accept the grace of this day.\nSisters and brothers, especially those of you experiencing pain and sorrow, your silent cry has been heard and your tears have been counted; not one of them has been lost! \nIn the passion and death of Jesus, God has taken upon himself all the evil in this world and in his infinite mercy has defeated it. He has uprooted the diabolical pride that poisons the human heart and wreaks violence and corruption on every side. The Lamb of God is victorious! That is why, today, we can joyfully cry out: 'Christ, my hope, has risen!' (Easter Sequence). \nThe resurrection of Jesus is indeed the basis of our hope. For in the light of this event, hope is no longer an illusion. Thanks to Christ \u2014 crucified and risen from the dead \u2014 hope does not disappoint! Spes non confundit! (cf. Rom 5:5). That hope is not an evasion, but a challenge; it does not delude, but empowers us.\nAll those who put their hope in God place their feeble hands in his strong and mighty hand; they let themselves be raised up and set out on a journey. Together with the risen Jesus, they become pilgrims of hope, witnesses of the victory of love and of the disarmed power of Life.\nChrist is risen! These words capture the whole meaning of our existence, for we were not made for death but for life. Easter is the celebration of life! God created us for life and wants the human family to rise again! In his eyes, every life is precious! The life of a child in the mother's womb, as well as the lives of the elderly and the sick, who in more and more countries are looked upon as people to be discarded.\nWhat a great thirst for death, for killing, we witness each day in the many conflicts raging in different parts of our world! How much violence we see, often even within families, directed at women and children! How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalised, and migrants!\nOn this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!\nI would like us to renew our hope that peace is possible! From the Holy Sepulchre, the Church of the Resurrection, where this year Easter is being celebrated by Catholics and Orthodox on the same day, may the light of peace radiate throughout the Holy Land and the entire world.\nI express my closeness to the sufferings of Christians in Palestine and Israel, and to all the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. The growing climate of anti-Semitism throughout the world is worrisome. Yet at the same time, I think of the people of Gaza, and its Christian community in particular, where the terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.\nI appeal to the warring parties: call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace!\nLet us pray for the Christian communities in Lebanon and in Syria, presently experiencing a delicate transition in its history. They aspire to stability and to participation in the life of their respective nations. I urge the whole Church to keep the Christians of the beloved Middle East in its thoughts and prayers.\nI also think in particular of the people of Yemen, who are experiencing one of the world's most serious and prolonged humanitarian crises because of war, and I invite all to find solutions through a constructive dialogue.\nMay the risen Christ grant Ukraine, devastated by war, his Easter gift of peace, and encourage all parties involved to pursue efforts aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace.\nOn this festive day, let us remember the South Caucasus and pray that a final peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan will soon be signed and implemented, and lead to long-awaited reconciliation in the region.\nMay the light of Easter inspire efforts to promote harmony in the western Balkans and sustain political leaders in their efforts to allay tensions and crises, and, together with their partner countries in the region, to reject dangerous and destabilising actions.\nMay the risen Christ, our hope, grant peace and consolation to the African peoples who are victims of violence and conflict, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Sudan and South Sudan. May he sustain those suffering from the tensions in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region, as well as those Christians who in many places are not able freely to profess their faith.\nThere can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression and respect for the views of others.\nNor is peace possible without true disarmament! The requirement that every people provide for its own defence must not turn into a race to rearmament. \nThe light of Easter impels us to break down the barriers that create division and are fraught with grave political and economic consequences. It impels us to care for one another, to increase our mutual solidarity, and to work for the integral development of each human person.\nDuring this time, let us not fail to assist the people of Myanmar, plagued by long years of armed conflict, who, with courage and patience, are dealing with the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Sagaing, which caused the death of thousands and great suffering for the many survivors, including orphans and the elderly. We pray for the victims and their loved ones, and we heartily thank all the generous volunteers carrying out the relief operations. \nThe announcement of a ceasefire by various actors in the country is a sign of hope for the whole of Myanmar.\nI appeal to all those in positions of political responsibility in our world not to yield to the logic of fear which only leads to isolation from others, but rather to use the resources available to help the needy, to fight hunger and to encourage initiatives that promote development. These are the 'weapons' of peace: weapons that build the future, instead of sowing seeds of death!\nMay the principle of humanity never fail to be the hallmark of our daily actions. In the face of the cruelty of conflicts that involve defenceless civilians and attack schools, hospitals and humanitarian workers, we cannot allow ourselves to forget that it is not targets that are struck, but persons, each possessed of a soul and human dignity.\nIn this Jubilee year, may Easter also be a fitting occasion for the liberation of prisoners of war and political prisoners!\nDear brothers and sisters,\nIn the Lord's Paschal Mystery, death and life contended in a stupendous struggle, but the Lord now lives forever (cf. Easter Sequence). He fills us with the certainty that we too are called to share in the life that knows no end, when the clash of arms and the rumble of death will be heard no more. Let us entrust ourselves to him, for he alone can make all things new (cf. Rev. 21:5)!\nHappy Easter to everyone!\"",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions.

This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Sister Midnight, Santosh and All We Imagine as Light are part of a new wave of female-centred Indian films challenging the roles of traditional Bollywood heroines.\nThey're unpredictable, sometimes humorous, sometimes sexually adventurous, and they're all leading characters, rather than orbiting a man. The heroines of films including Sister Midnight, Santosh, Girls Will Be Girls, All We Imagine as Light and Shadowbox are giving international audiences a chance to see female characters from India who differ from most traditional Bollywood heroines. But do Indian audiences want to watch them \u2013 or will they even be able to?\nA feral bride in an arranged marriage that neither she nor the groom particularly want, Uma is the protagonist of Karan Kandhari's spiky comedy Sister Midnight, which premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for a Bafta. Well-known Bollywood actress Radhika Apte, who plays her, is shown struggling with household chores. \"Men are dim,\" her neighbour tells her. \"They'll eat anything. Just add chilli and salt.\" Uma informs her awkward groom, who has gone on a week-long drinking binge, that he \"stinks\" and tells her employers sarcastically when they offer her a cleaning job that she's \"a domestic goddess\".\u00a0\nTold through offbeat dialogue, physical comedy and a punkish soundtrack that includes Iggy Pop, Sister Midnight presents a heroine unlike anything else filmed in India, according to Apte. \"I'd never read anything like it before and I couldn't put it down,\" she tells the BBC. \"I was completely taken by Uma, she was this crazy creature, and I didn't know why I resonated with her, but I just did. It was going to be a very thin line playing her between it being really cool and it going wrong. And that excited and challenged me. I also like how unapologetic Uma is and the more she accepts herself, the freer and stronger she becomes.\" \u00a0\nUma is the latest character that offers a different kind of female protagonist to Indian viewers, one who differs markedly from the traditional Bollywood heroine. \"Bollywood\", the name for Hindi-language studio cinema, has historically dominated the Indian box office, making around $1.36bn last year. But it's also been accused of being \"sexist and regressive\" in its attitude towards women. In 2023, a landmark study in India examined some of the country's biggest hits in terms of gender representation and sexual stereotyping, and found what they described as a \"formula\" to many of Bollywood's female characters.\u00a0\n\"The female lead has to be thin and beautiful. She has to be coy and demure who expresses consent through gestures rather than words, but [she] wears sexually revealing clothing and has to be somewhat modern to allow for her to be in a pre-marital relationship which is a transgression,\" Professor Lakshmi Lingam, the project lead for the study, told the BBC at the time. \"There's very little attempt to do something different.\"\nThe depiction of both male and female characters on screen is important, she added, because \"in India, where families and schools rarely teach about sex education and consent, all our responses are influenced by books and cinema\".\nBy contrast, the male stars of the biggest Bollywood films of 2023 were described as \"led by alpha male protagonists with rippling muscles and blazing guns brandished on screen as they went on a bone-crunching rampage to vanquish their enemies\". The hit films included Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan and Jawan, in which he plays a spy and vigilante, as well as the much-criticised, hyper-violent Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, a film accused of misogyny and objectifying women. It was made by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, whose previous film Kabir Singh showed the male lead openly stalking and harassing a woman and was the second biggest Bollywood movie of 2019.\u00a0\nThere have been hit films showing women in roles of authority, including female rocket scientists in Mission Mangal, also one of the most successful Bollywood films of 2019, and films praised for a modern perspective on gender roles, such as Karan Johar's Rocky aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (Rocky and Rani's Love Story). But nevertheless\u00a0Shubhra Gupta, the film critic for daily newspaper The Indian Express, laments the lack of \"wriggle room\" India's leading ladies generally have in their roles.\n\"These heroines' overriding principle is demureness,\" she tells the BBC. \"You can have flashes of spirit, or you may speak your mind, but you'd also be just right in terms of beauty, and you'd be very clearly subservient to the leading man and whatever he is doing. You are pretty much always bringing up the rear, with a few scenes in which you get to shine.\"\nIn Sandhya Suri's recent drama Santosh, however, a Dalit woman (from the lowest caste in Indian society) is as a police officer, with the authority that brings. Santosh inherits her husband's police officer job when he dies in service, something that's possible on compassionate grounds for government employees in India. Santosh, played by Shahana Goswami, is an enigmatic character who finds corruption in her local police force when a young girl is raped and murdered. She has a female boss, played by film and TV actress Sunita Rajwar, who has learned to compromise to stay at the top.\nSuri, previously a documentary maker, says she was influenced in making it by the real-life gang rape and murder in 2012 of a young woman on a bus in Delhi, which made worldwide headlines and led to new laws to safeguard women. (Despite that, sexual violence against women and girls remains high in India, and a 2022 report found that cruelty by a husband or his relatives remained the biggest crime against Indian women.)\n\"There were big protests at the time [of the rape and murder], and I saw the photo of a female cop being confronted by some very angry female protestors. I saw that image and I saw the expression on the cop's face, and it was so enigmatic that I was just very, very taken by it. It was so interesting. She was at both ends of power. There was the possibility of violence against her, but [it was] also possible for her to mete out violence as well with that uniform,\" Suri tells the BBC.\n\"I wanted to know if you took somebody like Santosh, shut up in the kitchen of her house, and you put her in that place, what's her response to that?\" she explains. \"I wanted to ask if there was a way to be a woman that's not about being a man, and not about being oppressed. Is there some other way in her society in which she can be, and that there may be a line she steps over?\"\nSantosh, which was made in Hindi, was the UK's Oscar entry for best international film in 2025 \u2013 one attribute both Sister Midnight and Santosh share is that, though they were filmed in India, they're made by British Indian film-makers. Sister Midnight's makers hope to release it in India in 2025, but Suri tells the BBC that Santosh will almost certainly not get a cinema release there.\n\"We screened it at the Mumbai International Film Festival and had a great response, and I was moved by just how real the film felt to a local audience,\" she says. \"But it looks like the film won't release in India, sadly, as it was admitted to the censor board (CBFC) and there were so many cuts, I couldn't maintain some semblance of a film.\"\nIndian censorship decisions have frequently caused controversy: in 2017, the decision to ban the feminist Indian movie Lipstick Under My Burkha for being \"too lady oriented\" caused an outcry, and was later overturned after negative publicity. But many homegrown blockbusters are self-censoring, especially when it comes to sex and sexuality.\u00a0\nThe 2021 Telugu-language hit Pushpa: The Rise, the story of a smuggler, removed a scene where the hero Pushpa (played by Allu Arjun) touches the chest of the heroine, Srivalli, because of complaints from the audience. In 2024, Pushpa 2: The Rule again caused controversy in India, according to Shubhra Gupta, because of an insinuation that Srivalli (played by Rashmika Mandanna) might want to be sexually intimate with her husband.\n\"The [female] character acts very cute, she comes on to the hero and is very playful when she wants a little assignation,\" Gupta says of it. \"The rest of the film she's serving the hero. She wants her husband not to have sex with anyone else. But in fact, it became a real talking point in India because it's not something heroes or leading ladies in the movies are supposed to have conversations about.\n\"And our mainstream film experience is still very much that if a woman has a sexual experience outside marriage, there will be some castigation attached to it,\" she adds. \"She won't be 'pure' anymore, she'll be known as 'bold' which means she's been around.\"\u00a0\nIt makes Payal Kapadia's acclaimed film All We Imagine as Light seem more audacious in terms of its exploration of sex. The first ever Indian winner of the Cannes Film Festival's Grand Prix is the story of a nurse, Prabha, who's been abandoned in her arranged marriage. Meanwhile, her younger flatmate Anu, a Hindu, wants to get intimate with her Muslim boyfriend, itself another taboo. There's no talk of marriage in advance.\n\"The film's about the preoccupations I've had for some time,\" Kapadia tells the BBC. \"Women in India can be financially independent, but there is still not a lot of autonomy with what you choose to do with your personal life. It's infantilising women. You could be 25 years old, making your own money, providing for your family back home. But you can't decide who to be with or who to marry.\"\nDespite the accolades, All We Imagine as Light was not chosen as India's 2025 Oscar entry (the deciding jury called it \"a European film taking place in India\".) But it wasn't the only film by an Indian female director in 2024 that put a young woman's sexual awakening on screen \u2013 the English and Hindi language movie Girls Will Be Girls, by Shuchi Talati, won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival. Set in a boarding school in the Himalayas, it's the story of an 18-year-old girl who falls in love with a boy for the first time, but whose romance is disrupted by her mother.\nBut Indian films breaking societal \"norms\" have found international recognition before, from Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding (2001), to Lipstick Under My Burkha (2016), and 2014's LGBTQ+ teenage love story, Margarita with a Straw. Shubhra Gupta says there's still a vast gap between what an international audience react to and what mainstream Indian audiences will pay to see, given the high ticket prices in cinemas.\n\"These films we're talking about are part of independent Indian film, which is really where all the exciting things happen, and that's pretty much true of all world cinema,\" she says. \"Payal Kapadia has had a fabulous journey with All We Imagine as Light, and it did get a cinema release here. But I'm not sure how much box office it made in India.\" She adds that many viewers in India would react in \"disbelief\" to heroines such as Sister Midnight's Uma and Santosh were they able to watch the movies, as they are so unconventional.\n\"They wouldn't be able to suspend disbelief that in Santosh, a Dalit woman from the lower caste, would be made into the lead, that she's driving the narrative. It would be such a hard sell here,\" she says. \"And Radhika Apte's character Uma is a wife, but she is not submissive. She goes out there and does all these mad things. They are excellent films that might do well on a streaming platform, or they will find a discerning audience\u00a0\u2013 but a discerning audience doesn't really make up the numbers that a big budget Bollywood film will.\"\u00a0\nBut Indian film-makers still have to try to break stereotypes for audiences, according to Tanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi, the directors behind Bengali-language film Shadowbox. The film, shown at this year's Berlin International Film Festival, is the story of Maya, (played by Tillotama Shome) who holds down several jobs and battles to keep her family going because her husband, a former soldier, struggles with his mental health and is frequently humiliated by the community because of it.\n\"When we're talking about working class underprivileged women, the term 'from the margins' tends to crop up,\" Das tells the BBC. \"But the 'margin' represents a huge majority of our population. Where are their stories, then? It's high time we broke stereotypes, and to do this more women need to tell their own stories. I feel producers and distributors of film underestimate how large a viewership women represent, and their appetite to see stories where their lives are mirrored rather than projected in a tokenistic way.\"\nIf cinema itself is not an option, the rise of the international streamers and OTT platforms (which allow viewers to watch content directly on their TV or through a phone app) during the Covid-19 pandemic has provided a place for recent, more audacious, female-focused film-making. The Great Indian Kitchen in 2021 by Jeo Baby, a Malayalam language film, became a hit on the app Neestream, and versions of the story were also made in Tamil and Hindi. It's the story of an arranged marriage, and the film shows, from a female viewpoint, household drudgery, unpleasant in-laws and monotonous and painful sex with an uncaring husband, with one female critic saying of it that \"the film rips through patriarchy, the bedrock of the institutions of family and religion.\"\nLaapataa Ladies, by Kiran Rao (which did become India's Oscar entry this year) also deals with an unwanted arranged marriage and was released on Netflix, as was 2020's Gunjan Saxena, which told the story of India's first ever female fighter pilot.\n\"But people are not actually buying a ticket for these,\" Gupta says. \"It's mostly 15-to 35-year-olds who are going to the movies, and often they happen to be young men. And the film industry is still a boy's club to a large extent.\"\u00a0\nFor more nuanced female characters to be seen in big-budget cinema films, ultimately Bollywood's lack of profits last year might be an impetus. After its bumper 2023, last year Bollywood only achieved 40% of the overall Indian box office profits, and Gupta says its \"formulaic films\" are part of the problem. \"People are hungry for something different,\" she says. \"But the problem is, if you take them too far out of their comfort zone, I'm not sure whether they're going to come to the cinema. So unfortunately, we've ended up maintaining this equilibrium so that people will come to the movies not expecting to see women who are feminists, or women who do not ascribe to the idea of what a good woman should be.\"\nHowever, she adds, it's not just female characters who have to be written differently in order for change to come. \"I would say that if you want your women characters to be different, you also have to write your men differently too,\" says Gupta. \"There needs to be a cosmic shift across the board.\"\nSantosh and Sister Midnight are currently on release in the UK. Sister Midnight will be released in the US on 16 May 2025.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, and\u00a0Instagram",

        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "I recently saw a statistic that surprised me: in February of 2025, Americans used their television sets to watch YouTube more than anything else. More than Disney. More than HBO. Even more than Netflix.\nI often think of YouTube as a service for young people \u2013 specifically, young people using their phones. But that's all changing. A recent report by research firm Moffett Nathanson projects that by the end of this year, YouTube's revenue will eclipse that of the entire Walt Disney Company (movies, theme parks and all). That report put it bluntly, dubbing YouTube the \"king of all media\".\nBut what does it mean for the rest of the entertainment industry when YouTube is more popular than anything else and YouTube stars seem just as likely to receive big Hollywood deals as A-list actors?\nI spoke about all of this with Lucas Shaw, a reporter and editor for Bloomberg and the author of the Screentime newsletter. It was a fun conversation \u2013 you can watch or read more of it here:\nBelow are excerpts from our conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity:\nKatty Kay: Lucas, people who became famous on YouTube \u2013 Mr. Beast, Cocomelon, etc \u2013 are now getting their own shows on streaming platforms. Is that the direction that we're going to see this going, where increasingly YouTube becomes the incubator for shows that then go onto streaming?\nLucas Shaw: Hollywood studios and TV networks have tried to make programming with social media talent \u2013 especially YouTube stars \u2013 for at least a decade now. Lilly Singh was a big YouTuber who got a late-night talk show; it didn't quite work. Grace Helbig was a big YouTuber who got a talk show. There were some movies that cast talent. We're now seeing a second or third attempt at it.\nI think part of the reason is that these stars have gotten so big that there is now greater confidence that they can deliver. And part of it is that Hollywood companies have learned that they can't force some of this talent into their formats. They have to sort of empower them to continue doing what they're doing. So, the Mr. Beast show for Amazon is just like a maximal version of what he does on his YouTube channel. And with Cocomelon, they're basically licensing YouTube videos and then paying them to make slightly longer and more expensive versions of it. We'll continue to see more of that.\u00a0\nKK: So, there's a difference in what it takes to be successful on YouTube compared to what it takes to be successful on traditional television and streaming platforms?\nLS: Yeah, I think so. I think what people want on YouTube is different from what they want from Netflix, at least for now. People come to like a creator for doing a specific thing.\nThere was a point in time at which this Swedish gaming creator PewDiePie was the biggest YouTube star in the world and YouTube funded an original program with him as part of this original programming initiative that they had. And it didn't resonate in the same way that his channel did, because it wasn't what people came to watch. People liked watching him speak off the cuff while playing games. There was an intimacy to that, but there was also a rawness and it felt sort of less sanitised and manicured. And so, then seeing him being a star of a more traditional TV show, even though it's already on YouTube, I just don't think it appealed to those people in the same way.\nKK: Lucas, you just came back from a trip around Asia. Is there no global competitor \u2013 or even an American competitor \u2013 who looks like it's going to knock YouTube off its perch of such huge dominance?\u00a0\nLS: There was definitely a moment where TikTok appeared to be that \u2013 and YouTube was intimidated because a lot of emerging and independent creators were posting to TikTok first. One of YouTube's great strengths historically was that it lowered the barrier to entry for anyone who wanted to make a video. And that barrier started to feel higher to some, because YouTube had gotten so big and there were established players. So, going from zero to 100 got much harder and they saw creators going to TikTok instead. TikTok is still a big competitor, but there just isn't anything that operates in as many different categories as YouTube. Spotify is competing with YouTube in music and in podcasting and in some video.\nNetflix obviously competes with YouTube globally; I'd say it's one of the biggest competitors in terms of entertainment. But YouTube and Netflix just play different roles, because YouTube is free. For instance, YouTube has hundreds of millions of users in India. Netflix has about 15 million. It's just much easier for YouTube to penetrate some of these poorer markets. Now, there's not as much money there, but from a just \"reach as many people as possible\" standpoint, there really isn't a direct comparison. Maybe Instagram.\nKK: I had a conversation recently with Jonathan Haidt and we were talking about kids and screen time and it occurred to me that so many of the social media companies \u2013 TikTok, Instagram, and others \u2013 have been hauled up before Congress to justify what they're doing. And YouTube seems to have escaped some of that scrutiny. How has it done that and do you think it'll carry on doing that?\nLS: I think it comes back to this idea that people don't know how to categorise YouTube. It is in some ways a social network, right? And I think some people initially saw it that way because it came from Silicon Valley, because there were comments, because people were uploading their own videos. But it is also an entertainment platform. But also, at its core \u2013 because it's part of Google \u2013 it's a search engine. That's in a lot of ways how Google views it. It's a video search engine. And so, I think the difficulty of categorising it has just made it so that people aren't quite sure how to approach it.\u00a0\nBut you're right that they haven't received the same scrutiny from a regulatory perspective, certainly not as much as Meta or TikTok, and it's a little bit baffling. You know, speaking from an American perspective, it is so funny to me that the government would not allow one company to own two domestic broadcast television networks, but it's fine that Meta owns both Facebook and Instagram, both of which reach way more people than any broadcast network. Or it's fine that Alphabet owns both Google and YouTube, both of which reach way more people than any broadcast TV network. So, I think part of this is also that our regulatory behavior is pretty antiquated.\nEditorial Note:\nThis conversation took place before the Federal Trade Commission and Mark Zuckerberg's\u00a0antitrust hearing\u00a0regarding Meta, Facebook and Instagram's parent company.\nKK:\u00a0What are the big changes that you see coming to the platform in the next year or two?\u00a0\nLS:\u00a0I'd say, in aggregate, the big change is that as more advertising dollars flow to YouTube creators and channels will have more money to invest in their programming. There's a pretty widely held belief that you'll continue to see the caliber and cost of some of the top YouTube shows go up and more closely resemble television. You may see some more expensive unscripted shows. Mr. Beast is one example, right? The average cost of one of his videos is $3m three or four million dollars, which is comparable to what you'd see on television, but not comparable to almost anything else you'd see on YouTube.\nAnother big area that I'm actually in the middle of writing a story about now is the growth of scripted programming. It's still pretty small on YouTube, partially because it is more complicated and more expensive. I think another part of it is that YouTube as a platform is just more hospitable to unscripted programming. But as it becomes possible to make more money on YouTube and as it becomes clearer to top writers and actors that there's a much bigger audience on YouTube than some of these other places, I think you'll see more and more people try scripted.\nKK:\u00a0Is YouTube the straw that broke the camel's back of monoculture? I grew up in an era where there were still just a few channels on television. Everybody watched the same thing. But now, it seems that it is really broken. And I wonder whether people will start hankering for that again, for a common experience in this very fragmented, polarised, divided world that we live in.\nLS:\u00a0I don't know the answer to that. I think we like the idea of there being a monoculture, right? It's fun when you have a moment like when\u00a0Barbie\u00a0came out and it seemed like everyone was talking about the movie or the\u00a0Taylor Swift tour\u00a0happens and everyone is talking about this tour. We are social creatures, and so we enjoy these moments where everyone is bonded by the same idea or interested in the same topic. But it certainly doesn't feel like we're on the precipice of returning to that in any way.\nIf you think about how Netflix and YouTube work, which are the two dominant entertainment platforms right now, they are tailored to your individual tastes. People don't watch shows and videos at the same time. There are things that go viral, but that virality is fairly short-lived.\u00a0\nI guess\u00a0Adolescence\u00a0in some ways feels like a monoculture moment, right? Everyone is watching and talking about this show. But unlike in the past, when that might last for the 10 or 20 or 30 weeks that it's on, it lasts for a week or two. And then, we're on to the next one. That pattern feels like it will only continue and accelerate. I don't see us reverting to some world in which we are all watching the same thing, unless there's a fundamental shift in the distribution mechanism.\u00a0\nKK:\u00a0Yeah, it's been described to me as a moment where we're living in a \"me culture\" with short attention spans.\nLS:\u00a0Yeah, because it's all about YouTube, Instagram, Netflix. Everything feels like they are serving you specifically, as opposed to serving all of us collectively.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "article_text": "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.\n\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.\nLucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.\nLucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.\nThe condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.\nLucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.\nThe abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.\n\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.\nThis is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.\nWithout medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.\nShe pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"\nAnd that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.\nIt is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.\nIn 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.\nIt is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.\n\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\" \nLucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.\nShe says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.\n\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"\nIP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.\n\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"\nIn response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.\nBut Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.\n\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.\n\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"\n\nLucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.\nNHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.\n\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"\nHer health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.\n\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"\nOnce she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.\nShe will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.\nOver a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.\nMeanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.\nThe embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.\nLucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.\n\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"\nA few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.\n\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.\n\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"\nYou can listen to Lucy Edwards on BBC Access All on BBC Sounds.

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions.

This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Perched on top of Santorini's sheer cliffs is a world-famous tourist industry worth millions. Underneath is the fizzing risk of an almighty explosion.\nA huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.\nNow scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.\nBBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.\nJust weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.\nIt was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.\nProf Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.\n\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.\nThis work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent. \nSantorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".\n\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.\n\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.\nThe Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.\nBeneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.\n\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.\nThe robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.\nThose vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.\nThey are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.\nSo far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.\n\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.\nThe Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.\nThe two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.\nThe expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.\nShe is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.\n\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.\nIt will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.\nThese missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.\nJohn Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.\n\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"\nPointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"\nThese rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.\nBut the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.\nUsing a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found. \nThey have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.\nThey identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.\nThis is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.\n\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.\nThe recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.\nBack on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.\n\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.\nShe's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says.\nIn the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.\nShe believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting.\n\"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said.\nBut Santorini will always be a dream destination.

They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.

        "article_text": "Two years ago, Dan Somers started to experience a series of strange and unexplained symptoms. He had severe chest pain, was unable to keep food or even water down and kept \"chucking up bile\".\nThough he had a sense that something might be wrong, Dan was reluctant to seek medical help. \"I'm really stubborn when it comes down to going to the doctors,\" the 43-year-old from Ipswich tells the BBC. \"I didn't want to be a burden.\"\nDan's pain continued to get worse, until he was \"near enough screaming on the floor in pain\" and had to take time off work. It was the worst pain he's ever experienced, he says upon reflection.\nBut \"I honestly thought I could try and fix it,\" Dan recalls.\nIt was his wife who finally managed to push Dan to see the doctor.\nHis GP sent him straight to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a gallbladder infection and spent a week recovering. He was told he had been close to getting sepsis.\nDan's story mirrors those of other men who've told the BBC they've also put off seeking medical treatment - often until their symptoms became unbearable or until a loved one pushed them to get help.\nIt's well known that men go to the doctors less than women, and data backs this up.\nThe NHS told the BBC it doesn't release demographic data about GP appointments. But according to the ONS Health Insight Survey from February, commissioned by NHS England, 45.8% of women compared to just 33.5% of men had attempted to make contact with their GP practice for themselves or someone else in their household in the last 28 days.\nMen were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and \"rarely or never\" used a pharmacy, too.\nThey also make up considerably fewer hospital outpatient appointments than women, even when pregnancy-related appointments are discounted.\nMen are \"less likely to attend routine appointments and more likely to delay help-seeking until symptoms interfere with daily function,\" says Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York.\nThis all affects men's health outcomes.\nExperts say there's a long list of reasons why men might put off seeking medical help, and new survey data from the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play.\nIn the survey, 48% of male respondents agreed they felt a degree of pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues, while a third agreed they felt talking about potential health concerns might make others see them as weak. The poll heard from almost 1,000 men in England in November and December 2024.\nSociety associates masculinity with traits like self-reliance, independence and not showing vulnerability, says social psychologist Prof Brendan Gough of Leeds Beckett University. \"Men are traditionally supposed to sort things out themselves\".\n\"It's worrying to see just how many men still feel unable to talk about their health concerns,\" says Dr Claire Fuller, NHS medical director for primary care. She notes that men can be reluctant to seek medical support for mental health and for changes in their bodies that could be signs of cancer.\n\"GPs are often the best way to access the help they need,\" she adds.\nKevin McMullan says he's learned from working for men's mental health charity ManHealth that men want to solve their own problems. He says he struggled with his mental health for years before he finally got help.\n\"You want to fix it yourself. Men are inherent problem-solvers and how you are feeling is a problem in the same way that having a flat tyre is a problem,\" says Kevin, 44, from Sedgefield in County Durham.\nThis is something that the Health Insights Survey indicates, too. The data suggests that when people were unable to contact their GP practice, men were significantly more likely than women to report \"self-managing\" their condition, while women were more likely than men to go to a pharmacy or call 111.\n\"Many men feel that help-seeking threatens their sense of independence or competence,\" Prof Galdas says.\nProf Galdas points to other factors deterring men from going to the doctors, like appointment systems that don't fit around their working patterns.\nServices also rely on talking openly about problems, he suggests, which doesn't reflect how men speak about health concerns - and there are no fixed check-ups targeting younger men.\nWomen, in contrast, are \"sort of forced to engage in the health system\" because they might seek appointments related to menstruation, contraception, cervical screenings or pregnancy, says Seb Pillon, a GP in Bolton.\nAnd they're largely in control of organising their family's healthcare, too. For example, roughly 90% of the people who contacted the children's sleep charity Sleep Action for help in the last six months were mums, grandmothers and other women in the children's lives, its head of service Alyson O'Brien says.\nBecause women are more integrated in the healthcare system - through seeking support for both themselves and their children - they're more health-literate and are often the driving force behind their partners seeking medical help, according to Prof Galdas.\nAnd men just have a different attitude towards healthcare, Dr Pillon says. He believes many see it solely as treatment - solving their problems - rather than preventative. Men are, for example, less likely to take part in the NHS's bowel cancer screening programme. As Prof Galdas says: \"men often seek help when symptoms disrupt their ability to function.\"\nFor Jonathan Anstee, 54, from Surrey, it took his symptoms getting drastically worse for him to book a doctors appointment, after months of stomach aches and blood in his stool.\n\"The pain got a lot worse and the blood got a lot worse,\" Jonathan says. \"But even when I went to the doctors, I was sat in the waiting room thinking 'this is a massive waste of time'.\"\nHe was diagnosed with bowel cancer in September 2022.\nThroughout his life he'd generally avoided doctors appointments, Jonathan says. And as a father, \"you're used to worrying about your kids and not yourself,\" he says. Going to the doctors for himself, not his children, seemed \"a bit sort of indulgent\", he says.\nLast year, Jonathan was told his bowel cancer was stage four.\nHaving blood in his stool had felt too embarrassing to talk to his friends and family about at the time. Jonathan's advice to other men is: \"There is absolutely no need to be embarrassed. The alternative could kill you - literally.\"\nIn recent years, support groups for men with cancer and mental health conditions have sprung up.\nMatthew Wiltshire started the men's charity the Cancer Club after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2015. He died in 2023.\nMatthew felt there wasn't a space \"where men were openly talking about what it's like to go through cancer,\" his son, Oliver Wiltshire, says. \"He also noticed how much of the emotional load was being carried by the women around him.\"\nThrough the Cancer Club, men can message online and attend sports events together.\n\"Whether it's practical advice, honest chat or just knowing someone else gets it, that connection can make a big difference,\" Oliver adds.\nExperts say that while men's attitudes towards healthcare are gradually changing for the better, more work still needs to be done.\nProf Galdas believes men will engage more if services are redesigned to meet their needs - proactively offering support, having flexible access and focusing on practical action to improve mental health issues.\n\"There's good evidence from gender-responsive programmes in mental health, cancer care, and health checks showing this consistently,\" he says.\nFor Dr Pillon, it's adding general health checks for men in their 20s to get them more used to accessing medical care. \nThey're already available through the NHS for people aged 40 to 74, but introducing them for younger men who might not otherwise go to the doctors would \"embed the idea that you can come and use health services\", he says.\nIf you have been affected by some of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.",

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.Of course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.This is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.Some people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. \"So Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.Why can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. \"Verstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".The guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option.",

It's a real family affair, with Benn's sisters and cousin also joining him in camp.\nHaving spent 12 years of his childhood in Mallorca, Benn speaks fluent Spanish to the locals in the gym.\nWhen the training session begins, however, the laughter stops. There is noticeable shift in mindset \u2013 a sign of just how serious Benn is approaching this fight.\nHe says he is \"leaving no stone unturned\" as he fights for the family name \u2013 and to prove his own worth - in this bloodline rivalry.\n\"I've got a chip on my shoulder about [people] saying I'm the nepo kid, that I had it easy,\" he adds.\nBut this is no longer about fathers. Benn's reputation amongst boxing fans has been stained.\nAlthough he has been cleared to fight by an anti-doping panel, they feel he should be more transparent about the reasons behind the failed test.\nBenn says he has been \"cleared three times\" and is reluctant to dwell on the past. \nNigel, meanwhile, speaks more openly about the impact it had on them both, saying \u00a31m was spent on the legal battles.\nThe former super-middleweight champion says he is not a drinker but would consume \"half a bottle of red wine every night\" during the period as his mental health issues worsened, while his son turned to therapy to get through the dark times.\n\"I was watching my son really crying in my arms, heartbroken. I just knew [he was innocent],\" Nigel adds.\n\"Because [if he was] I would let the public know, I'd say, 'Mate, yeah, sorry mate, he's done this'. But I know he hasn't and I will stand with my son.\"\nNigel Benn was a two-weight world champion during his boxing career\nBenn taps into modern-day training methods by sporting an oxygen mask during cardio to simulate high-altitude training.\nHe expertly talks about nutrition, saying in the past he was \"eating curries and pop-tarts\" after weigh-ins.\nThere is something quite comical about the way he unintentionally reels his past takeaway order in the style of Smithy from sitcom Gavin and Stacey.\n\"I'd have prawn puri for starters, lamb rogan josh, Bombay potatoes with some saag aloo, peshwari naan, all the poppadoms, pilau rice, saag paneer,\" Benn says.\nThere is no doubt he is now living the life of an elite athlete.\nBut so much has happened outside of the ring that we have forgotten, or perhaps never had the opportunity to truly find out, how good a boxer Benn actually is. \nBefore his ban, he was on a roll with early stoppage victories over past-their-prime Chris Algieri and Chris van Heerden.\nHis two fights in America since the cancelled Eubank bout \u2013 points wins over Rodolfo Orozco and Peter Dobson - have been rather unspectacular.\nBenn is a vastly improved fighter from the novice dropped by French journeyman Cedrick Peynaud in 2017.\nHowever, with around 20 amateur bouts in Australia before he turned pro, how costly has the time out of the ring \u2013 not to mention the mental scars inflicted by the doping scandal \u2013 been on Benn's boxing apprenticeship?\nBenn has been sparring the likes of IBF super-middleweight champion William Scull and undefeated middleweight Bruno Surace.\nNigel raves enthusiastically about a particularly \"mind-blowing\" sparring session against an unnamed top-level fighter which left him too excited to sleep.\n\"I'm 99% sure he will [beat Eubank] within four rounds,\" Nigel predicts.\nIs this a case of rose-tinted dad glasses or an unbiased analysis from one of the best British fighters ever?\nWorld-title challenger Eubank has fought at a significantly higher level. Although a stipulation prevents Eubank from gaining more than 10lb on fight night, he is still the more natural at the weight. \n\"Yes, I am jumping up two weight divisions. Yes, that brings its challenges,\" Benn says.\n\"And yes his CV's better, but the difference between me and him is he's lost every time he stepped up. I haven't.\"\nBenn believes that \"people see this as a 50/50\" contest, even though Eubank is the bookmakers' favourite.\n\"I must be delusional or people just don't know what they're dealing with,\" he says.\n\"Because I see it being a one-sided beatdown.

        "article_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of creating an \"impression\" of a ceasefire while still taking military actions in some places in Ukraine.\nIn the first six hours of the \"Easter truce\" - as ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin - Zelensky said there had been 387 shellings and 19 assaults by Russian forces, and drones used 290 times. There are no reports of casualties.\nPutin ordered his forces to \"stop all military activity\" in Ukraine from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday. Kyiv said it would also adhere.\nRussia's defence ministry insisted all Russian forces had been adhering to the truce and accused Ukraine's army of breaking it.\nRussia said Ukrainian units fired at the positions of Russian troops 444 times, carried out 900 strikes with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), 12 shellings, 33 strikes by UAVs and seven drops of munitions. The ministry said there were dead and wounded among the civilian population. It did not give any details.\nZelensky on Sunday morning said Moscow was \"trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine.\"\nAccusing Russia of specific military actions, Zelensky added that \"everywhere our warriors are responding as the enemy deserves, based on the specific combat situation.\"\nBecause Putin's ceasefire was announced minutes before it was due to take effect, an immediate, complete pause was always unlikely, but the BBC in Ukraine reports it has been quieter on the front lines.\nBefore Zelensky said there had been continued attacks in some areas, at midnight on Saturday there were no reported Russian drones or fighter jets in Ukrainian skies. \nThat is very rare.\nThe only report was that a Russian ship with missile launchers had been deployed to the Black Sea. \nIn the southern city of Odesa, it was silent. On Friday, before Moscow's announcement, air defences crackled throughout the night as Russian drones flew in from the direction of occupied Crimea.\nLate on Saturday - hours into the truce - Zelensky had said: \"If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russia's actions.\" \n\"Our actions are and will be symmetrical. The proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table \u2014 the answer to it must come from Moscow,\" he wrote on X. \nZelensky said Ukraine would be ready to extend a truce beyond 20 April, seemingly referring to an earlier proposal from the US for a 30-day ceasefire which Ukraine had already agreed to. \nIt seems now both Moscow and Kyiv want to show Washington they are serious about peace. The question of whether the Kremlin accepts Zelensky's offer to turn this truce from a 30-hour one to a 30 day one is central to any potential path to peace.\nFew Ukrainians think that is remotely possible.\nPutin had announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov.\n\"Based on humanitarian considerations... the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period,\" Putin told Gerasimov.\n\"We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.\"\nThe Russian defence ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was \"mutually respected\" by Ukraine.\nIt is not the first time a pause in fighting has been suddenly announced - a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 fell apart after both sides failed to agree on a proposal. \nReacting to the recent truce announcement, a UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for - not just a one day pause for Easter.\"\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides. \nThe US has been directly talking to Russia as part of its efforts to end the war, but has struggled to make major progress. \nLast month, Moscow came up with a long list of conditions in response to a full and unconditional ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine.\nUS President Donald Trump on Friday warned Washington would \"take a pass\" on brokering further talks on ending the war in Ukraine unless there was quick progress.\nHe was speaking after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not \"going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end\", as it had \"other priorities to focus on\".\n\"We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable,\" he added. \n\"If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on.\"",

Since then, Delhi and Washington have been working towards an early conclusion of trade negotiations.\nIn his speech in Jaipur, Vance said that the two countries had finalised the terms of reference for the negotiation.\n\"This is a vital step toward realising President Trump and Prime Minister Modi's vision because it sets a roadmap toward a final deal between our nations,\" Vance said.\nHe also called Modi a \"tough negotiator\" and someone \"who drives a hard bargain\", drawing applause from the audience.\nModi and Trump share a warm personal relationship: the Indian prime minister was among the first global leaders to visit Trump after his second term began. But the US president has repeatedly taken aim at India's high tariffs, branding it a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.\nEven in the statement issued on Monday after Vance's meeting with Modi, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer highlighted the \"serious lack of reciprocity in the trade relationship with India\".\nIndia has already cut tariffs on a number of goods in the past few months and is reportedly considering more wide-ranging cuts to pacify Trump. But sectors like agriculture - where Washington wants greater access, but India fiercely protects - are still sticking points. \nVance also said in Jaipur that the US is seeking to sell more energy and defence equipment to Delhi. On Monday, in addition to trade, the two leaders had also discussed cooperation in defence, strategic technologies and energy.\nThe Indian prime minister also said after the meeting that he was looking forward to welcoming Trump to India this year. Delhi is hosting the Quad summit later this year and the US president is expected to attend it.\nThe bilateral meeting was followed by delegation-level talks and a dinner hosted by Modi for Vance and his family. \nVance arrived in India on Monday morning, accompanied by his wife Usha and their three children. Usha Vance's parents migrated to the US from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and some media reports have said that Vance and his wife are keen to introduce their children to their Indian heritage.\nPhotographs of the three children wearing Indian-style outfits - the two boys in kurta-pyjamas and three-year-old Mirabel wearing a lehenga - on their arrival in India were splashed across Indian newspapers and websites.\nThe rest of Vance's visit is largely personal. After the meeting with Modi, the family visited Jaipur city, where they visited the historic Amer Fort on Tuesday. \nThe family is also set to visit the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra city on Wednesday before flying to the US the next day.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola's side are third in the Premier League and in the FA Cup semi-finals\nSometimes there is no need to say anything.\nWhen you are as expressive on the touchline as Pep Guardiola, visual evidence can be enough to gauge the importance of an occasion.\nIn Tuesday's 2-1 victory over Aston Villa, there was a long period of simmering discontent, then thinly disguised fury at the penalty given against his team after referee Craig Pawson had been told to stop the game to check Ruben Dias' 'foul' on Jacob Ramsey.\nMost thought video assistant referee (VAR) John Brooks was right. Guardiola was not among them. He shook his head, ranted at his coaches on the bench, then launched a tirade towards the nearby fourth official.\nGuardiola was booked for his emotive reaction but he felt wronged. He was still shaking his head forcefully, his face set like stone, as the replay was shown on the big screen at the exact moment he returned to his seat after half-time.\nThen there was a demand for more noise, gesturing to all parts of the ground for City's fans to turn up the volume, and a familiar sink to the knees as James McAtee's delicate lob dropped just the wrong side of the post.\nFinally there was the tension release of Matheus Nunes' injury-time winner. Guardiola reacted as though he had scored himself, acknowledging the noise from the fans he wanted more from earlier.\nThere was a storming of the pitch as the whistle blew, a hug - tight - for Nunes, a laugh and a joke with Kevin de Bruyne, who at the weekend revealed his manager had not even made an offer for him to stay at the end of the season.\nMake no mistake, this win was big.\n\"You don't have to be a scientist to realise that we were playing against Aston Villa, one of the best teams, as you saw against Newcastle and PSG,\" said Guardiola.\n\"They are an extraordinary team but we performed as we did in the past with the commitment.\n\"Qualification for the Champions League is important, of course, but sometimes we have to be calm. We must focus on the semi-final and after we have days to prepare for the four 'finals'. Two at home, two away.\"\nBy that, Guardiola means Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, and then back to the Premier League for key games against Wolves and relegated Southampton before the final two - Bournemouth at home, Fulham away - interspersed, he hopes, with another trip to Wembley.\nFour points separate five teams - who will prosper in race for Europe?\nNunes sends Man City third with late winner against Villa\nManchester City fans have been protesting against ticket prices\nIn Guardiola's mind, it is all so clear.\nIt is why detached observers are led to the conclusion City's football is regimented.\nYet, the reality is Guardiola is making subtle tweaks as the season goes on.\nHe accepts what he has now is not what even he expected when the campaign began, when Rodri and Erling Haaland were available, not on the bench as they were again against Villa due to injury.\nNo-one would have predicted Saturday's hero at Everton would be 20-year-old Nico O'Reilly, making his fourth league start. Against Villa it would be Nunes, signed from Wolves for \u00a353m in September 2023 when a plan to bring in Lucas Paqueta from West Ham had to be aborted, who turned into a right-back rather than his central midfield scheming role.\n\"If you told me at the beginning of the season that at the end of it we would be fighting for the FA Cup final or to qualify for the Champions League with Nico and Matheus at full-back, I'd say: 'What are you talking about?'\" said Guardiola.\n\"Matheus is a person that is incredibly loved. When you talk with the journalists he's always so serious but in the locker room he's always laughing.\n\"He has physicality for when he has to run and sustain the wingers. Step by step he has been so important.\"\nIt's another puzzle solved for Guardiola. Another solution found.\nIt will be fascinating now to see if City can keep alive their hopes of domestic silverware alive.\nThey have failed to win at least one trophy only three times since they won the FA Cup in 2011 to end their long wait for success.\nSince Guardiola's first season in 2016-17, City have always won at least one of the three domestic competitions on offer.\nIn theory, the supporters have never had it so good.\nBut many are not happy. Protests against ticket prices took place again before kick-off.\nThose running the club argue the finance generated allows Guardiola to have the squad he demands. The fans do not agree - and Guardiola agrees with them.\n\"I am on the side of the people,\" he said. \"I'm a supporter for Manchester City as well.\n\"I don't have to pay [for] the tickets but I understand the feeling.\n\"When I go to the theatre or to a concert and I pay for the ticket, I want to see something I like.\n\"We want them here and we want a full stadium every time.\"\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The west Belfast rap group Kneecap have hit back at a call for their US visas to be revoked after their performance at Coachella where they ended their set with pro-Palestinian messages.\nWriting on social media, TV personality and music manager Sharon Osbourne said the hip-hop trio \"took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements\".\nWhen asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: \"Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.\"\nThe festival's organisers have also been approached for comment.\nKneecap have been vocal supporters of the Palestinian people, often raising the conflict in their live performances.\nHamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages.\nIsrael launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to figures released by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe number of children who have been killed in Gaza is disputed. International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.\nSpeaking to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 , Kneecap's manager said: \"If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.\"\nDaniel Lambert added: \"Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.\"\nHe also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as \"too severe to get into\".\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that \"may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted\".\nThe band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.\nOn Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included \"projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech\".\n\"This band openly support terrorist organizations,\" she added.\nMs Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).\n\"Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,\" Osbourne said.\n\"However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,\" she continued.\n\"This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\" Osbourne said.\n\"I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,\" she said.\nOsbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.\nShe also managed her husband's solo career.\nOsbourne finished her post by saying: \"As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.\n\"I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.\" \nThe festival organisers have been approached for comment.\nWarning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive\nAt the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.\nThe first message said: \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" followed by: \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,\" and a final screen added: \"[Expletive] Israel. Free Palestine.\"\nDuring the performance, band member Mo Chara said: \"The Irish not so long ago were persecuted at the hands of the Brits, but we were never bombed from the... skies with nowhere to go.\n\"The Palestinians have nowhere to go.\"\nThe band also led the audience in chants of: \"Free, free Palestine\".\nOn 11 April, during Kneecap's first Coachella performance, the group faced criticism after leading an anti-Margaret Thatcher chant - which was subsequently omitted from the festival's livestream - along with calls for a united Ireland.\nA US State Department spokesperson said: \"Due to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally will not comment on department actions with respect to specific cases.\"\nThey said the Trump administration \"is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process\".\n\"When considering revocations, the department looks at information that arises after the visa was issued that may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted,\" they added.\n\"This can include everything from arrests, criminal convictions, and engaging in conduct that is inconsistent with the visa classification, to an overstay.\"",

        "article_text": "Boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Girl fends off love rivals and boy - finally - declares his affection for her.\nIf you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor.\nBut in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention. \nContent creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.\nLatey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette). \nTen women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas. \nThroughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.\nBroadcast on YouTube, Lately is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.\nWinning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".\nOf course, not everyone feels the same way. \n\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.\n\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"\nMr Semere, aged 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.\nSeveral viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"\nAnother asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"\nMs Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.\n\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.\n\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"\nArguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.\nIn one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.\nVivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years. \n\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.\nElsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.\nBy baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.\nMs Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.\n\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.\n\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"\nShe says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\" \nAdapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"\nA second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"\nOff the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.\nThis time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.\n\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.\nAs for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.\n\"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says.\nBut Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\".\nShe is proud that Latey showcased \"the romantic side of Ethiopia\" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media.\n\"It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,\" she says.\n\"It is a new way of seeing.\"\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

I was having to play a different game that I didn't enjoy and it didn't feel like I could express myself, so it got really tough.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan has won the World Snooker Championship seven times and is aiming to become the first man in the modern era to gain eight titles\nAsked if there were times in the past week where he thought he had made a mistake about returning to snooker, O'Sullivan said: \"Yeah, totally. \n\"I thought 'what am I doing coming here, exposing myself, [potentially] imploding out there, having a meltdown?' All that went through my head. I told [sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters that and he said 'I'm coming - I will get you through the first match'.\n\"I was quite a bit scared coming and playing. It's a daunting venue to play at anyway but it's about getting on the bike again and playing and I'm really proud that I've done that.\n\"Even if I had lost, it didn't really matter.

There's still a lot of work to do.\"\nO'Sullivan scored 504 points in five frames on Wednesday, compared with just 43 for Ali Carter\nIn Tuesday's first session against two-time Crucible finalist Carter, neither player was at their best, with it seemingly finely balanced at 5-4 to O'Sullivan.\nBut on Wednesday, 'The Rocket' was in sensational form, winning all five frames and not letting Carter score a point in four of them.\nO'Sullivan made breaks of 59, 117, 74, 123 and 131, but in the post-match news conference stressed he was trying to \"rebuild\" his technique after losing faith in his ability.\nHe said: \"I couldn't even watch myself play as I could see what was wrong. I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'.\n\"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things. I had lost all connection with the cue, the timing had gone, the touch had gone, feeling had gone. Years and years of that mounted up and it got to the point where I couldn't play and it got too much.\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't pull the cue forwards and backwards, which was quite scary.\"\nO'Sullivan beat Carter in the Crucible finals in 2008 and 2012\nFour seeded players, including world champions Kyren Wilson and Neil Robertson and last year's runner-up Jak Jones have been eliminated from O'Sullivan's half of the draw.\nChinese qualifier Pang Junxu is his opponent in the second round, although O'Sullivan said he enjoyed his Crucible return because he had not placed any expectations on himself. \n\"This game can humble you so many times,\" said O'Sullivan. \"To play one good session. It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there.\n\"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much.\n\"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\"\nCarter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday.\n\"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well.\n\"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'.\n\"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp. This boy is in that [bracket]. It's been over an extended period as well, and when he plays the cue ball sings.\n\"O'Sullivan seems in a very good place. He was born to play snooker, and when he's out there he's at peace with it.\"\nRuthless O'Sullivan cruises into Crucible last 16\nWatch: World Snooker Championship - Trump leads Zhou, Selby v Woollaston\nWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage",

        "article_text": "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.\n\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.\nLucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.\nLucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.\nThe condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.\nLucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.\nThe abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.\n\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.\nThis is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.\nWithout medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.\nShe pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"\nAnd that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.\nIt is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.\nIn 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.\nIt is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.\n\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\" \nLucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.\nShe says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.\n\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"\nIP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.\n\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"\nIn response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.\nBut Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.\n\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.\n\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"\n\nLucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.\nNHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.\n\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"\nHer health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.\n\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"\nOnce she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.\nShe will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.\nOver a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.\nMeanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.\nThe embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.\nLucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.\n\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"\nA few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.\n\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.\n\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"\nYou can listen to Lucy Edwards on BBC Access All on BBC Sounds.

        "summary": "'Why I want an IVF baby to screen out gene that made me go blind'2 days agoShareSaveBeth RoseBBC Access AllShareSaveRNIBAs well as an influencer, author, broadcaster and RNIB ambassador, Lucy Edwards is hoping to become a mum Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind. \"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. \"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. \"Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. \"In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.But Lucy says responses have been different around the world.",

The cardinal will remain in the position during the \"Apostolica Sedes Vacans\", the period between the death or resignation of a pope until the election of the next pontiff. \nHe also will play an important role in the centuries-old ceremonies to mourn Pope Francis. \nBorn in 1947 in Dublin, Farrell attended the University of Salamanca in Spain and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, according to the Vatican.\nHe held roles in churches around the world, serving as a chaplain at the University of Monterrey in Mexico as well as at a parish in Bethesda, Maryland. \nAll told, the 77-year-old spent more than 30 years working for churches in the US. \nFarrell was appointed Bishop of Dallas in 2007 until Pope Francis asked him in 2016 to serve as the leader of the Vatican's new department responsible for the pastoral care of families, raising him to the rank of cardinal.\nYears after naming him as camerlengo, in 2023, Francis chose Farrell as president of the Supreme Court of Vatican City State. He was also named president of the Commission for Confidential Matters.\nAs camerlengo, Cardinal Farrell will be tasked with making arrangements for the conclave, the process through which the next pontiff is selected. \nTechnically, a camerlengo can become pope, as has happened twice in history: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939.\nThe cardinal also will preside over the certification of Francis's death, laying his body into the coffin.

The curious case of Swiatek's hex against Ostapenko - Second ServePublished21 April 2025, 11:31 BSTIn the latest edition of Second Serve, our new weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the key talking points.Usually Iga Swiatek is the one dishing out the bagels.In recent years, the five-time major champion has become known for the ruthless manner of her victories, subjecting many opponents to the ultimate embarrassment of losing a set without winning a game.Now 23-year-old Swiatek finds herself in the position of being on the wrong end of a 6-0 scoreline - having lost to Jelena Ostapenko for the sixth time in a row.Ostapenko extended her flawless head-to-head record against the world number two in the Stuttgart quarter-finals on Saturday.So what's behind the one-sided results?Having won the 2017 French Open, Ostapenko certainly has the pedigree and her explosive ball-bashing - when it works, and the winners outweigh the unforced errors - can have devastating consequences.Swiatek has encountered trouble against aggressive ball-strikers, too, so that adds further weight to the explanation.You also wonder whether there is a mental block against an opponent who a player knows has their number.Swiatek disputed that afterwards, saying her head \"was much more clear\" against Ostapenko in Stuttgart than her previous defeats.While the agony was prolonged, you can't imagine a player of Swiatek's quality will suffer a career-spanning hex.There is a long way to go until Swiatek enters the conversation of being on the receiving end of the most dominant head-to-head record.Gael Monfils has lost all 20 of his matches (so far) against Novak Djokovic, while Richard Gasquet's 18-0 record against Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer's 17-0 against Roger Federer are other notable lopsided match-ups in recent years.In fact, Swiatek could end the chastening run as early as next week, with Ostapenko slated to be a prospective last-16 opponent in Madrid.British number four Harriet Dart caused a stink by telling her French opponent to put on deodorant at the Rouen Open.Rafael Nadal might not be playing the French Open this year - a strange feeling indeed - but the 14-time men's singles champion will be honoured in a ceremony at Roland Garros.Serena Williams claims she would have been treated differently to Jannik Sinner if she had failed two doping tests.The two-year wait is over for Holger Rune.

These range from the absurd to the serious: failing to give a month's notice before quitting your job or not walking your dog enough, to offences like illegal arms possession, murder and sexual assault.\nDelhi-based think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy calls it \"India's crisis of over-criminalisation\".\nIn a new report, The State of the System: Understanding the Scale of Crime and Punishment in India, the think-tank has produced the country's first comprehensive database of crimes, mapping the extent of criminalisation across 370 federal laws.\nThe report flags India's habit of reaching for criminal law to solve just about everything - even the mundane. It notes that many laws criminalise \"routine, everyday actions\". \nYou could, for instance, be charged for tethering your goat on a public street, fixing a leaky tap without a licence or not naming the owner of a building when asked. \nThen there are the truly obscure offences - like a parent ignoring a school attendance order, applying for a driver's licence when banned or littering in a zoo. Basically, there's a criminal penalty waiting around every corner of daily life.\nLet your pigs wander on to a field or road and you could be fined 10 rupees (12 cents). Disturb an animal or litter in a zoo? Six months in jail or a 2,000-rupee fine. And failing to exercise your dog can cost you up to 100 rupees and three months in jail.\nPromoting infant milk substitutes or feeding bottles to pregnant women or mothers can lead to up to three years in jail or a 5,000-rupee fine. (This was meant to curb aggressive marketing by formula food companies, but the law also applies to individuals, which makes it controversial.)\nJail is the go-to punishment in India - 73% of crimes carry prison terms ranging from a single day to 20 years.\nMore than 250 offences across 117 laws penalise delays in filing documents - everything from wealth and property tax returns to gift declarations, the report finds. \nSome 124 crimes across 80 laws criminalise obstructing a public officer, often without clearly defining what causes \"obstruction\". \nEven the death penalty isn't off the table - not just for murder or mutiny, but for damaging an oil or gas pipeline or a sentry caught sleeping on duty. In all, a staggering 301 offences in India can legally cost you your life.\nOut of 7,305 offences under central laws, nearly 80% come with fines - from as low as two rupees to a staggering 50m rupees. \nTo be fair, many of these provisions are rarely used - India's crime records bureau tracks around 50 laws, even though 370 carry criminal penalties.\n\"They're not heavily enforced, but they create ample opportunities for rent-seeking,\" Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, co-author of the study at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, told me.\n\"There's enough in the books to jail almost anyone for some technical non-compliance. It's less about actual use and more about the potential for misuse.\"  \nThis \"excessive use of criminal law not only disrupts the daily lives of ordinary citizens but also creates significant barriers for business operations\", the report says. \nBusinesses in India face a maze of regulations, but using criminal law as the default for non-compliance is excessive, disproportionate and often counter-productive, experts say.\nThe report also talks about some glaring inconsistencies in crime and punishment.\nRioting - the use of force or violence by an unlawful assembly - is punishable with up to two years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, falsely reporting a birth or death for official records can lead to three years of imprisonment. \nThe irony? Violence in public gets a lighter sentence than a lie on paper.\nEven more striking: crimes of vastly different severity carry the same penalty - like practicing homoeopathy without a licence, jumping a red light, or forcing someone into labour - all punishable with a one-year sentence.\nThe sheer number of crimes tied to everyday life and business shows how heavily the state leans on criminalisation to enforce compliance, the report says.\n\"This over-reliance has significant costs, not just for citizens and businesses, but also for state machinery.\"\nOver 34 million criminal cases are pending in India's courts, with 72% stuck for more than a year. Prisons are overcrowded, running at 131% capacity, while courts and police forces continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages\nEven the law-and-order machinery is stretched. As of 1 January 2023, India had just 154 police personnel per 100,000 people - well below the sanctioned 195. Nationwide, there are 581,000 vacancies against an approved strength of 2.72 million.\n\"Even then, we continue to rely on this overburdened system to combat minor infractions, including those that attract nominal fines,\" the report says.\nIt says that criminal law should be limited to acts that threaten core societal values - like public safety, national security, life, liberty, property and social harmony.\nAuthorities say they plan to scrap criminal penalties in more than 100 legal provisions - on top of the 180 already axed in 2023. It's not just legal clean-up; it's a chance to rethink how the law treats people. Less fear, more trust. Less suspect, more citizen.  ",

And we want to build on the relationship that we have,\" she added later speaking at a Semafor event.\nSome US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.\nSpeaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was \"not going to rush into a deal\".\nBut she said the government was \"confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries\".\n\"We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,\" she added.\nReeves said that the UK had been \"really clear\" in discussions with US negotiators \"that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK\".\n\"The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,\" she said.\nMany American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s.\nThe US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.\nFarmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.\nShadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would \"expect\" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards \"but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal\".\nHe said it is \"hugely important\" to \"get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down\" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.\n\"It's taken them a long time, in fact, to even have got in the room with the US administration to start discussing these issues, let alone getting a deal now,\" he said.\nTrump has brought in a large number of tariffs on imports to the US, arguing they will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs.\nThese include, as part of an ongoing trade war, levies of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.\nThe move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets.\nPrices are expected to rise for consumers in the US as a result of the tariffs, due to the companies importing goods passing on higher costs.\nThe IMF has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty caused by tariffs, and says it expects US growth to be hit the hardest.\nOn Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth \"very seriously\".\nHowever, Reeves said: \"I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.\"\nShe said the UK \"is not one of those countries\" so \"there is a deal there to be done between the UK and the US\".\nShe added that she understood \"the need to rebalance the global economy\".\nThis, in part, is why the UK announced on Wednesday a review of low-value imports coming into the UK which are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\" she said.\nThis mirrors a US action, with the White House set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May.\nIt is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.\nThe removal of the so-called \"de minimis\" rule will hit companies including fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.\nShein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".\nThe UK government said that the UK Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) would be putting more resources into helping firms report unfair trade practices as part of its review.",

        "article_text": "Attorneys delivered opening statements on Wednesday in the New York retrial of Harvey Weinstein, with prosecutors accusing the disgraced film producer of using his immense power in Hollywood to sexually harass and abuse three women. \n\"The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday. \nIn his third trial in five years, Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress and a model. \nThe former film mogul has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility.\nAttorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would \"fall flat on its face\" after they heard all the evidence.\n\"They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,\" he said.\nA court of appeals overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, before he was indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.\nLast week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate. \nOn Wednesday, Ms Lucey spent an hour delivering an opening statement, telling jurors that three women had fallen victim to the abuse of a \"Hollywood gatekeeper\" who held \"unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry\".\nThe retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16. \nOn Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them. \nVictims \"kept their shame and their pain to themselves\" for years because of Weistein's role as a man who \"defined the field\" of acting and film, Ms Lucey said. \nDuring his hour of opening statements that followed, Weinstein's attorney took a combative approach, accusing the women of having \"mutually beneficial\" sexual relationships with Weinstein and being motivated by money. \n\"These women are addicted to that fame,\" Mr Aidala said. \"They want to be heroes.\" \nMr Aidala argued that Weinstein could not have assaulted the women because they kept in contact with him and sent him friendly messages after the encounters. \nLast April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over. \nWeinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.\nHe was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.\nWeinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he was taken to hospital for heart surgery and has been held in a secure hospital unit. \nA judge has approved a request from Weinstein's lawyers to let him stay at the Bellevue hospital in Manhattan when he is not in court. \nHis lawyers had complained that he was receiving poor medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous Rikers Island prison facility - which officials have long said they plan to close - though the move has been delayed. \nIn total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women. \nHe is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, as he has yet to begin serving his 16-year California sentence. \nThe decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.\nSpeaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they \"suddenly realized they were not alone\".\nBefore the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.\nWeinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.\nHis films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.\nThe former film mogul has also faced a number of civil lawsuits, including from a group of women who accused him of sexual harassment and rape and reached a $19m (\u00a314.2) settlement with him in 2020.

Guardiola was not among them. He shook his head, ranted at his coaches on the bench, then launched a tirade towards the nearby fourth official.\nGuardiola was booked for his emotive reaction but he felt wronged. He was still shaking his head forcefully, his face set like stone, as the replay was shown on the big screen at the exact moment he returned to his seat after half-time.\nThen there was a demand for more noise, gesturing to all parts of the ground for City's fans to turn up the volume, and a familiar sink to the knees as James McAtee's delicate lob dropped just the wrong side of the post.\nFinally there was the tension release of Matheus Nunes' injury-time winner. Guardiola reacted as though he had scored himself, acknowledging the noise from the fans he wanted more from earlier.\nThere was a storming of the pitch as the whistle blew, a hug - tight - for Nunes, a laugh and a joke with Kevin de Bruyne, who at the weekend revealed his manager had not even made an offer for him to stay at the end of the season.\nMake no mistake, this win was big.\n\"You don't have to be a scientist to realise that we were playing against Aston Villa, one of the best teams, as you saw against Newcastle and PSG,\" said Guardiola.\n\"They are an extraordinary team but we performed as we did in the past with the commitment.\n\"Qualification for the Champions League is important, of course, but sometimes we have to be calm. We must focus on the semi-final and after we have days to prepare for the four 'finals'. Two at home, two away.\"\nBy that, Guardiola means Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, and then back to the Premier League for key games against Wolves and relegated Southampton before the final two - Bournemouth at home, Fulham away - interspersed, he hopes, with another trip to Wembley.\nFour points separate five teams - who will prosper in race for Europe?\nNunes sends Man City third with late winner against Villa\nManchester City fans have been protesting against ticket prices\nIn Guardiola's mind, it is all so clear.\nIt is why detached observers are led to the conclusion City's football is regimented.\nYet, the reality is Guardiola is making subtle tweaks as the season goes on.\nHe accepts what he has now is not what even he expected when the campaign began, when Rodri and Erling Haaland were available, not on the bench as they were again against Villa due to injury.\nNo-one would have predicted Saturday's hero at Everton would be 20-year-old Nico O'Reilly, making his fourth league start. Against Villa it would be Nunes, signed from Wolves for \u00a353m in September 2023 when a plan to bring in Lucas Paqueta from West Ham had to be aborted, who turned into a right-back rather than his central midfield scheming role.\n\"If you told me at the beginning of the season that at the end of it we would be fighting for the FA Cup final or to qualify for the Champions League with Nico and Matheus at full-back, I'd say: 'What are you talking about?'\" said Guardiola.\n\"Matheus is a person that is incredibly loved. When you talk with the journalists he's always so serious but in the locker room he's always laughing.\n\"He has physicality for when he has to run and sustain the wingers. Step by step he has been so important.\"\nIt's another puzzle solved for Guardiola. Another solution found.\nIt will be fascinating now to see if City can keep alive their hopes of domestic silverware alive.\nThey have failed to win at least one trophy only three times since they won the FA Cup in 2011 to end their long wait for success.\nSince Guardiola's first season in 2016-17, City have always won at least one of the three domestic competitions on offer.\nIn theory, the supporters have never had it so good.\nBut many are not happy. Protests against ticket prices took place again before kick-off.\nThose running the club argue the finance generated allows Guardiola to have the squad he demands. The fans do not agree - and Guardiola agrees with them.\n\"I am on the side of the people,\" he said. \"I'm a supporter for Manchester City as well.\n\"I don't have to pay [for] the tickets but I understand the feeling.\n\"When I go to the theatre or to a concert and I pay for the ticket, I want to see something I like.\n\"We want them here and we want a full stadium every time.\"\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "For 16 generations, master gardeners in this one family have dedicated their lives to preserving one of the nation's most cherished \u2013 and highly sought-out \u2013 symbols.\nEach spring during sakura (cherry blossom) season, the Ninna-ji and Daikaku-ji temples in Kyoto's leafy Ukyo ward are overwhelmed by busloads of tourists who come to snap photos of the temples' blooming cherry trees. But little do they know that only a few kilometres away, there's a secret sakura garden hiding in plain sight.\nThis 1.5-hectare public plot, known as the Sano family garden, is an oasis of calm; found just off an unassuming street near traditional wooden machiya townhouses. But this isn't just any ordinary cherry blossom tree grove; it's also the domain of 97-year-old T\u014demon Sano: Japan's most renowned sakuramori (cherry blossom guardian).\nFor more than a millennium, Japanese people have admired the delicate sakura petals as a symbol of transience and beauty. Today, this national pastime has blossomed into an international obsession, with millions of tourists from across the world descending on Japan to sip seasonal sakura-themed Starbucks drinks and participate in hanami (cherry blossom viewing) picnics and festivals from March to May. But while the world waits with bated breath for the cotton candy-coloured blossoms to burst each spring, one of the most important and least understood roles in the trees' maintenance lies with their behind-the-scenes caretakers.\nAccording to Naoko Abe, cherry blossom expert and author of The Sakura Obsession, skilled sakura arborists have existed in Japan since time immemorial. But thanks to the popularity of the 1970s novel Sakuramori about a sakura-infatuated tree expert, communities began bestowing this title to deserving specialists in the years that followed. Typically a professional gardener or tree surgeon, a sakuramori is a combination of Lorax, botanist and spiritual guide dedicated to studying sakura and promoting their preservation.\nAs Asada Nobuyuki, the secretary general of the Japan Sakura Association, explained, there are roughly 100 sakuramori in Japan today, but one stands out. \"It can be said that T\u014demon Sano is most deserving of the title sakuramori,\" said Nobuyuki, crediting the breadth of Sano's long, productive career and his family's generational wisdom.\nOn a Friday morning earlier this month, I crunched through gravel at this historic sanctuary to meet Sano himself. He is the 16th generation in a distinguished line of farmers who began cultivating the nearby land (known for its late-blooming dwarf cherry trees) in the mid-1600s. When his father died in 1981, he assumed the first name T\u014demon, per family tradition, and took the reins of Uet\u014d Z\u014den, the landscaping firm his family started in 1832 that is headquartered in the garden.\nFor more than 80 years,Sano has utilised his specialised knowledge to steward the survival of sakura trees in gardens throughout Japan and the world \u2013 including at the Isamu Noguchi-designed Japanese garden at the Unesco headquarters in Paris. Sakura Taikan, his most famous book, is the definitive tome on the trees and the culmination of research begun by his grandfather during the\u00a0Taish\u014d period (1912\u20131926).\nBut just before our visit, the nonagenarian became ill and was rushed to hospital. Still, he arranged for me to meet his son, Shinichi Sano, who oversees operations at Uet\u014d Z\u014den and who will one day succeed his father and carry on the family legacy as the next T\u014demon and sakuramori.\nAs we strolled through the garden, Shinichi paused at an umbrella-like shidarezakura (weeping cherry), its swooping branches covered in geisha-blush blossoms. Shinichi said this 40-year-old tree was grown from the seeds of the most iconic sakura in Kyoto: the dramatic weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park, which was originally grown in the Sano family garden and replanted in its current public spot by T\u014demon's father, the 15th T\u014demon Sano.\nThough sakura have attracted hanami lovers for generations, Shinichi said a major threat now looms over them: climate change. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, cherry blossoms have started to bloom 1.2 days earlier per decade since 1953. A recent study found that the peak bloom of Kyoto's cherry blossoms in 2020, 2021 and 2023 were the earliest in more than 1,200 years.\n\"If global warming continues at this rate, I believe there will eventually be regions in Japan where cherry trees no longer bloom,\" Shinichi said, noting that winters with elevated temperatures could nip blooms in the bud entirely, as trees require a sustained chill to initiate the blossoming process. If this happens, a major part of Japan's springtime tourism appeal would be jeopardised \u2013 as well as an integral part of the nation's cultural identity.\n\"The reason Japanese people are fond of cherry blossoms is because, after enduring a harsh winter, the vivid flowers bloom in the monochrome landscape as if to herald the long-awaited arrival of spring. This quiet presence is what draws people in and resonates deeply in our hearts,\" T\u014demon later told me over email after being released from hospital. \"Out of 365 days a year, the cherry blossoms endure wind and snow for 360 days, only to bloom gloriously for five days before gracefully scattering. I believe this fleeting yet dignified cycle reflects the Japanese perspective on life. There may be a sense of personification in the way we view the cherry blossom, as if it embodies a spiritual or moral belief that, through patience and perseverance, one will eventually bloom.\"\u00a0\nCherry blossoms are integral to the Japanese psyche and soul. In ancient Japan, kami (deities) were said to reside in the trees. Beginning in the 800s, Emperor Saga (whose former residence is up the road from the Sano family garden at Daikaku-ji) ushered in the practice of hanami with official cherry blossom viewing parties. For samurai during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), sakura became a unifying military symbol for the warriors to fall with dignity and grace \u2013 a message echoed during World War Two for kamikaze pilots. In light of this national importance, protecting sakura and ensuring their sustainability is something Japan takes seriously.\nToday, according to Abe, many of the most famous places travellers go to see sakura in Japan, such as Mount Yoshino in Nara and Matsumae Park in Hokkaido, each have a dedicated sakuramori. Interestingly, T\u014demon and his family's unbroken line of Japanese gardeners may not have risen to the level of sakuramori were it not for a British botanist.\nIn 1902, English naturalist Collingwood \"Cherry\" Ingram became fascinated by Japanese cherry trees during his first visit to the nation, but he lamented how industrialisation and cloning had led to a decline in their diversity. In an effort to protect them, he sent 50 endangered varieties back to England and planted them in his garden. When he eventually tried to propagate the varieties back in Japan come the 1930s, including the rare Taihaku cherry that had ceased to be cultivated in Japan, the trees didn't survive long.\nGiven the Sano family's generational expertise, Ingram sought out T\u014demon's grandfather, who developed a way to transport the trees successfully so they wouldn't sprout before arriving in Japan. From that little shipment of Taihaku trees, it is thought that tens of thousands of Tahihaku now flourish across Japan and were saved from national extinction.\nWhere to see T\u014demon Sano's sakura in Kyoto:\nIn addition to admiring T\u014demon's carefully cultivated sakura at Maruyama Park, the Ruriko-in estate, the Katsura and Shugauin imperial villas and the Ninna-ji Temple, visitors can also explore the Sano family garden year-round from 09:00 to 16:00 (best to call ahead at +81 75-871-4202).\nT\u014demon's grandfather became something of a Johnny Appleseed for sakura \u2013 taking grafts and growing saplings, venturing to far-flung places like the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin before he died in 1934. T\u014demon's father then took up the mantle while training his son to continue the family legacy.\nToday, travellers enjoying the mesmerising weeping cherry in Maruyama Park have T\u014demon to thank, as the city asks him to care for the tree throughout the year. Visitors can also admire T\u014demon's work at the Ruriko-in estate, where sakura stand in stunning harmony on the property close to the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji; the Katsura Imperial Villa; the Shukaguin Imperial Villa; Ninna-ji Temple garden; and, of course, at the nearby Sano family property.\nEven at 97,\u00a0T\u014demon still collects information on different types of sakura and makes detailed drawings of the blossoms' anatomy from the stamen and pistils to the bracts and peduncles \u2013 all to better understand how to help sakura flourish.\n\"My feelings toward cherry blossoms are something that has been ingrained in my daily life,\" T\u014demon said. \"My daily life follows the old Japanese way of life seik\u014d-udoku, 'working in the fields when it's sunny and reading when it rains'\u2026 If I am asked to preserve rare cherry blossoms, I respond by grafting or sowing seeds.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 96-year-old painter who saved a village\u00a0\n\u2022 The 89-year-old woman who is still travelling the world solo\n\u2022 Japan's unusual way to view the world\nTo that end, he has successfully propagated cherry trees in the atomic bomb-ravaged soil of Hiroshima and saved a 150-year-old Oshima cherry tree in Yokohama that was destined to be cut down. In that instance, when the local community enlisted him to relocate the storied sakura 100m away to preserve an iconic view of Mt Fuji, he took careful stock of the three layers of soil surrounding the tree. Before digging, T\u014demon ceremonially placed sake and rice crackers in the dirt as an apology for the disruption, added charcoal and provided an octopus offering. Also known to hug trees, T\u014demon embraced the trunk tightly upon its successful replanting.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs I toured the Sano family garden, falling\u00a0cherry petals fluttered to the ground like snowflakes, a phenomenon called sakura fubuki. In addition to kami, the souls of ancestors are also said to reside in the flowering cherry blossoms, connecting\u00a0the Sano family to their forebearers and representing the fleeting nature of each generation.\u00a0Amid this transient beauty, the Japanese concept of\u00a0\"mono no aware\" (the wistful recognition of life's ephemerality and the beauty in that impermanence) feels especially present.\u00a0\n\"Cherry blossoms reflect the way of life of the samurai in the old days: beautiful in the way they fall with grace and dignity,\" Shinichi said. Shinichi's 38-year-old son, Tomoaki, who has started to take over day-to-day responsibilities in the family business, has one child \u2013 a daughter. It would then be possible to have the first female sakuramori in this line.\n\"It will depend on her decision,\" Shinichi said.\nFor now, though, the family is allowing the 16th T\u014demon Sano to focus his attentions on what he does best.\n\"While my father is healthy, he will be the one to take care of the sakura,\" Shinichi said. I then asked if he felt he would one day be ready to assume the role of T\u014demon Sano and sakuramori.\u00a0\n\"I won't really know until I actually become the 17th generation,\" Shinichi said. \"I think I will truly feel the responsibility for the first time when I actually inherit the name\u2026 I'll do what I'm asked to.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.\nSpeaking to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 , Kneecap's manager said: \"If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.\"\nDaniel Lambert added: \"Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.\"\nHe also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as \"too severe to get into\".\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that \"may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted\".\nThe band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.\nOn Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included \"projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech\".\n\"This band openly support terrorist organizations,\" she added.\nMs Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).\n\"Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,\" Osbourne said.\n\"However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,\" she continued.\n\"This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\" Osbourne said.\n\"I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,\" she said.\nOsbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.\nShe also managed her husband's solo career.\nOsbourne finished her post by saying: \"As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.\n\"I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.\" \nThe festival organisers have been approached for comment.\nWarning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive\nAt the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.\nThe first message said: \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" followed by: \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,\" and a final screen added: \"[Expletive] Israel.

        "article_text": "Nearly 50,000 people queued in less than 24 hours to pay their respects to Pope Francis, whose body is being displayed in an open coffin at St Peter's Basilica, the Vatican says. \nEntry to the church in Vatican City was due to stop at midnight local time (22:00 GMT) on Wednesday, but opening hours were extended to accommodate large crowds gathered outside. \nPublic viewing continued on Thursday.\nThe Argentine pontiff died on Monday at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke. He had spent five weeks in hospital earlier this year receiving treatment for double pneumonia.\nPope Francis was the first Latin American leader of the Catholic Church and held the role for 12 years.\nRed-robed cardinals and white-clad priests escorted the Pope's coffin from his residence to the basilica on Wednesday. \nBells tolled during the 40-minute procession, while the crowd broke into applause - a traditional Italian sign of respect.\nSwiss Guards, who are responsible for the Pope's safety, escorted his coffin to the church's altar.\nPublic viewing began at 11:00 local time on Wednesday. \nSoon after, the queue was already eight hours long, according to Italian media. By mid-afternoon, tens of thousands of people were lining the square.\nAt midnight, when the church was supposed to close for the night, there was still a very long queue of people wanting to pay their respects.\nPolice in the Vatican had told the BBC that St Peter's Basilica would stay open all night so that a large crowd gathered on the square could file past the coffin.\nViewing continued until 05:30 on Thursday, then closed for an hour and a half, before reopening at 07:00. \nThe Pope's body will lie in state in the church until Friday evening, when his coffin will be sealed during a liturgical rite at 20:00, the Vatican said.\nThe ceremony will be overseen by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is the Pope's \"camerlengo\" or chamberlain and runs the Vatican until a new Pope is chosen. \nLuis and Macarena, from Mexico, had come to Rome for their honeymoon and hoped to see the Pope, who gives a special blessing to newlyweds. Luis told the BBC seeing the Pope's final resting place would allow them to feel a connection.\n\"Pope Francis is a saint and he will bless us from heaven,\" Luis said.\nMary Ellen, an American who lives in Italy, said she had come to the Vatican on an overnight train to \"say goodbye\".\n\"I love Papa Francesco,\" she said. \"Because he's humble, kind, he loves immigrants. I know he's put up with a lot of difficult things in the Vatican. He's fought against power and the power of the Vatican to be a true Christian, true Catholic.\"\nShe said when she passes the coffin, she will be praying and will ask Pope Francis for help with her own work with immigrants.\nInside St Peter's, under the watchful marble eye of popes and saints, a steady stream of people made their way to the Pope's casket to pay their respects.\nSome kneeled while others prayed and crossed themselves, before slowly moving on.\nMany lingered to admire the staggering beauty of the basilica. The atmosphere was quiet and solemn despite the thousands of people present.\nTwo women who waited for five hours to see the Pope said they had arrived at the basilica's queue at 09:00.\nOne told the BBC it was important to her to say goodbye to the pontiff.\n\"All these years I followed all he did and it's as if I travelled all over the world with him, even if I was just at home. He liked going everywhere and prioritises the poor,\" she said.\nAsked what was it like to see him in his coffin, she replied: \"It's just like the man we used to see on TV.\"\nFredrik, who is from Ghana but travelled from Poland, said the Pope had \"done his best\" and \"it is left to us to continue the good works\".\nEva Asensio, a Mexican on holiday in Italy, said she felt an affinity for the Argentine pope. \n\"We saw him as a good Pope \u2013 someone who supported everyone, no matter your sexual orientation, no matter where you came from. He united us,\" she said with tears in her eyes.\nMargaux, who is French and lives in Rome, said it was \"powerful to live this.\" \nTo her, Pope Francis meant \"hope\", and his more progressive social views were \"very important\", she said.\n\"I hope the next Pope will follow his path,\" she said.\nDignitaries from all over the world, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Prince William, will attend the funeral on Saturday.\nPope Francis left clear instructions that he wanted a smaller ceremony in keeping with his simpler tastes as pontiff. He had arranged for a benefactor to pay for it all.\nUnlike the vast majority of his predecessors, he will not be buried in St Peter's, but in a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in central Rome, beneath a tombstone inscribed only with his name.\nBefore being moved to St Peter's, Pope Francis had been lying in an open coffin in the chapel of his home, flanked by Swiss Guards and cardinals in prayer.\nHis last public appearance was on Easter Sunday, during which he delivered brief remarks to the masses gathered in St Peter's Square from a wheelchair. \nHe then greeted worshippers and blessed babies as he was driven in a car through the crowds.\nHis Papal apartments have been sealed, marking the start of the period known as the Sede Vacante - or empty seat \u2013  which continues until a new head of the church is elected.\n\nAdditional reporting by Jorge Perez",

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

        "summary": "- KateMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.The stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.This is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.However, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.This was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.Of course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.This is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.Some people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. \"So Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.Why can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. \"Verstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".The guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option.",

Doctors believed she may have had a stroke. \nShe had only been due to remain there for four days for tests, but came out two years later completely paralysed. Unable to walk, talk or open her eyes, she was told she would never move again. \nMegan was diagnosed with Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), which meant there was a problem with how her brain received and sent information to the rest of the body.\nHaving stayed in a neurological care home in Peterborough, she is now preparing to move into her own home with the hope of becoming a nail technician. \nMegan said at the age of 18, when she moved to Eagle Wood Neurological Care Centre, she was \"still just a baby\". \nShe had never been on her own before and had to move away from her family near Bath to receive the care she needed. \n\"It was not easy. I think it was a lot harder for my mum and dad to have to leave me there on my own, but I couldn't do anything for myself. I was paralysed from the neck down,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I couldn't see, I couldn't talk. I hate the word, but I was very vulnerable at the time.\n\"I started feeling poorly when I was 13. It started off very slowly, very gradually and then in 2021, things just declined rapidly.\n\"I was taken into hospital because they were concerned I had had a stroke, or something, because I lost the ability to talk.\n\"I was taken for four days of tests and came out of hospital two years later.\" \nHer illness was eventually diagnosed as FND.\n\"It stops the functioning of signals from the brain to your body from working properly and causes all sorts of neurological symptoms,\" she said. \n\"I couldn't do anything for myself, I lost the ability to talk.\n\"I couldn't see, so I wasn't able to open my eyes. My brain couldn't register the difference between eyes closed and eyes being open.\"\nShe also lost the ability to swallow and was fed by a feeding tube in her mouth, which has been replaced by one straight into her stomach.\nAt her worst, she had 50 seizures a day, but that has now reduced to between 10 and 15.\nAfter 18 months of extensive therapy, her life is completely different. \nShe said: \"I can move everything now. Obviously I can talk, I can see. I can't walk and I'm never going to be able to walk again, but that's because I've got contractions in my knees.\n\"I need surgery in order to bend them because my legs are stuck straight. It's very painful, but I'm waiting on surgery, and it means I'm never going to be able to walk again.\n\"Honestly, it was something I never thought I would be planning when my parents took me to the care home. They thought that was it - that it was going to be my home for the rest of my life. \n\"I was getting to the point that I nearly died in hospital, my body just shut down that much. \n\"The doctors did have to tell my parents to prepare for the worst - they didn't think I would make it to 18 and here I am at 20.\"\nHer dream is to be a nail technician and she is saving up to complete an online course. \n\"I really can't wait to finally move out and get a place with my boyfriend,\" she said. \"I'm very excited.\"\nFND Action said the brain network disorder encompassed neurological symptoms including limb weakness, paralysis, seizures, walking difficulties, spasms, twitching, sensory issues and more. \n\"For many, symptoms are severe and disabling, and life-changing for all,\" it said.\nIt added that while the basic wiring of the nervous system was intact, people with the disorder had a problem with how the brain or nervous system was \"functioning\", and the brain failed to send or receive signals correctly. \n\"Historically FND has often been viewed as resulting purely from psychological and emotional trauma, this has frequently led to stigma and dismissal from medical professionals,\" it added. \n\"This view is now seen as outdated, and psychological trauma is now viewed as a risk factor for developing the condition rather than the root cause.\"\nMegan said she had been left isolated, frustrated and exhausted at times due to how \"unpredictable\" life with FND had been.\nShe now shares her experiences on TikTok. \n\"Every small victory, whether it's moving a finger, speaking a word, or simply making it through another day is worth celebrating,\" she said.\nFollow Peterborough news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

I was just sliding around. It's pretty bad.\"\nHe is seventh in the drivers' championship with his best result in a full grand prix this season his fifth place in Bahrain a week ago.\nHamilton said that he was \"struggling to feel the car beneath me\" but that there was \"no particular thing, nothing to say: 'Hey, this is the issue.'\"\nAnd asked why he had been so good in the sprint race in China last month, where he won from pole position, and had struggled elsewhere, he said: \"I don't have an answer.\"\nBriton Hamilton, 40, said he expected to struggle at the next race in Miami, too, adding: \"I don't know how much longer I'll struggle for but it's definitely painful. Just going to try and improve from week to week.\"\n\"At the moment there is no fix so this is how it's going to be for the rest or the year. It's going to be painful.\n\"In qualifying it's me extracting performance and in the race I tried everything and the car just didn't want to go any quicker.\"\nVerstappen would not discuss penalty because 'people can't handle the full truth'\nPiastri wins in Saudi Arabia and takes title lead\nLeclerc, by contrast, drove an outstanding race with a long first stint on the medium tyres to catch and pass Mercedes' George Russell for the final podium place.\nHe said: \"I feel like we've maximised absolutely everything we could have this weekend. There wasn't anything more in the car.\n\"We need to focus on qualifying because it's been a very long time I haven't been as happy with the car balance.\n\"I feel very at ease with the car in a way that I know I can extract the maximum out of the car more often than not, but unfortunately, the car potential is just not good enough to fight for better in qualifying.\"\nFerrari just missed out on winning the constructors' championship last year and started this season hoping to compete for the title.\nBut McLaren and Red Bull have progressed more than the Italian team over the winter.\nLeclerc said: \"We are close on the race pace. Free air dictates a little bit who is going to win the race. That's always been the case. Maybe this year a little bit more than other years. And obviously when that is the case, qualifying is more important.\n\"But unfortunately, for two years, we are just struggling in qualifying to put everything together.\n\"The problem is it's not always the same issue. This time it was four tenths in the first three corners. For the rest of the lap, we were fast. And now today in the race, actually, the first sector was probably the best sector we had.\n\"So we've got to look at that. Obviously, there are answers in what we are doing, and we are doing something wrong, clearly. We've got to find it.\n\"We cannot lose too many races before finding it because we're already 50 points down in the drivers' championship.\n\"We're not looking at it too much, but 50 points is a big number.

        "article_text": "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.\nRunning for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.\nIt's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.\nThe project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.\nThe facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".\n\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.\nTo make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete. \nMost underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.\n\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"\nWith a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.\nIt's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.\nOnce completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.\nBypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.\n\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"\nTowered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.\n\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.\nThere are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.\nAt the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"\nNot only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.\nNext it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.\n\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"\nDenmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.\nWith layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.\nA bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.\n\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"\nSo, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"\nDenmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.\nOne such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.\nHowever in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.\n\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.\nWhen the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.\nAccording to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.\nIt's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.\n\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\"",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions.

This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The west Belfast rap group Kneecap have hit back at a call for their US visas to be revoked after their performance at Coachella where they ended their set with pro-Palestinian messages.\nWriting on social media, TV personality and music manager Sharon Osbourne said the hip-hop trio \"took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements\".\nWhen asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: \"Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.\"\nThe festival's organisers have also been approached for comment.\nKneecap have been vocal supporters of the Palestinian people, often raising the conflict in their live performances.\nHamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages.\nIsrael launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to figures released by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe number of children who have been killed in Gaza is disputed. International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.\nSpeaking to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 , Kneecap's manager said: \"If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.\"\nDaniel Lambert added: \"Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.\"\nHe also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as \"too severe to get into\".\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that \"may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted\".\nThe band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.\nOn Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included \"projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech\".\n\"This band openly support terrorist organizations,\" she added.\nMs Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).\n\"Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,\" Osbourne said.\n\"However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,\" she continued.\n\"This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\" Osbourne said.\n\"I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,\" she said.\nOsbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.\nShe also managed her husband's solo career.\nOsbourne finished her post by saying: \"As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.\n\"I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.\" \nThe festival organisers have been approached for comment.\nWarning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive\nAt the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.\nThe first message said: \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" followed by: \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,\" and a final screen added: \"[Expletive] Israel. Free Palestine.\"\nDuring the performance, band member Mo Chara said: \"The Irish not so long ago were persecuted at the hands of the Brits, but we were never bombed from the... skies with nowhere to go.\n\"The Palestinians have nowhere to go.\"\nThe band also led the audience in chants of: \"Free, free Palestine\".\nOn 11 April, during Kneecap's first Coachella performance, the group faced criticism after leading an anti-Margaret Thatcher chant - which was subsequently omitted from the festival's livestream - along with calls for a united Ireland.\nA US State Department spokesperson said: \"Due to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally will not comment on department actions with respect to specific cases.\"\nThey said the Trump administration \"is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process\".\n\"When considering revocations, the department looks at information that arises after the visa was issued that may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted,\" they added.\n\"This can include everything from arrests, criminal convictions, and engaging in conduct that is inconsistent with the visa classification, to an overstay.\"",

But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine.\nSince making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an \"important step\" in those facing addiction.\n\"It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?\" she says.\n\"To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different.\n\"That's why we've shared James's story.\"\nChanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine.\n\"There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs,\" she says.\n\"But it's not just about reclassification [\u2026] it needs to include education, police, health, to really raise awareness. We need a strategy around drug usage and drug deaths in the UK.\"\nThe UK government is currently seeking experts' advice on the re-classification of ketamine, with Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson writing to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) expressing concern over the rise in young people taking the drug.\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"Our thoughts are with James's family and friends, and all those affected by this tragic death, which has sadly reinforced once again the serious dangers of taking ketamine.\n\"We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply.\"\nChanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family \"talked about what we can do\".\n\"The Vivienne left a legacy as a trailblazing icon and this, I feel, is James's legacy. To help other people,\" she says.\n\"If I can help one family to not feel what we are feeling, then it's all worth it.\"\nYou can see the full interview with The Vivienne's sister Chanel on BBC Newsnight at 10:30 on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

        "article_text": "A Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration has been moved to a new prison, US Senator Chris Van Hollen has said.\nThe Democratic senator was speaking after returning from El Salvador where he met Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, who was sent to the notorious mega-jail Cecot (Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism) last month.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was \"traumatised\" and fearful of other prisoners while inside the facility, Van Hollen said, adding that he was moved to another facility in the country over a week ago.\nThe Supreme Court has ordered the government to \"facilitate\" his return, however Trump administration officials have continued to push back against the order.\nThe White House accuses him of being a member of the transnational Salvadoran gang MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organisation, and has said he will not return to the US. \nOn Sunday, Van Hollen appeared on all major US Sunday morning programmes to express his frustration with how the Trump administration has handled Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's mistaken deportation. \n\"I am not defending the man,\" he said in an interview with ABC News. \"I'm defending the rights of this man to due process.\"\nVan Hollen stressed that he went to El Salvador to ensure both the rule of law and the right to due process before the courts are upheld. \"If we take it away from [Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda], we do jeopardise it for everybody else,\" he said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has never been convicted of a crime. His family and attorneys have fiercely denied he is a member of MS-13. \nVan Hollen said he was initially blocked from meeting Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by Salvadoran authorities. Later, he said government officials helped facilitate a meeting and Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was brought to the senator's hotel.\n\"His conversation with me was the first communication that he had with anybody outside of prison since he was abducted,\" Van Hollen said.\n\"He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes.\"\nVan Hollen added that conditions in the new prison, in the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana, were better.\n\"He still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world,\" Van Hollen said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's case is part of a simmering showdown between the Trump administration and the US courts system on the issue of immigration. \nA separate feud has been brewing after a judge said he could hold the Trump administration in contempt for its \"wilful disregard\" of his order barring deportation flights. \nMultiple judges - including a unanimous US Supreme Court ruling - said the government should facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return to the US. But the White House has insisted the Maryland man will \"never\" live in the US again.\n\"If he [Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda] ever ends up back in the United States, he would immediately be deported again,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters at the White House Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was \"not a very innocent guy\".\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has faced at least two other allegations of criminal activity, neither of which resulted in a conviction.\nHis wife alleged in a 2021 protective order request that he'd physically attacked her on multiple occasions, according to documents shared by the US Department of Homeland Security.\nJennifer Vasquez Sura decided not to follow through with the court process, saying she and her husband were \"able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counselling\".\nA separate incident was reported in 2022, when Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was pulled over in Tennessee for allegedly speeding. \nAn officer speculated that he was involved in human trafficking, due to him having multiple people in the car and telling authorities he'd been travelling from Texas to Maryland, according to information shared by the Department of Homeland Security that was obtained by the BBC's partner CBS. \nNo criminal case was launched from the incident. His wife said he \"worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites\". \nAt the heart of the case, though, are the allegations of his involvement in MS-13, which the Trump administration used to expel him under the Alien Enemies Act.\nThe president has evoked the law to deport hundreds so far, by arguing the alleged gang members were terrorists. \nSen Van Hollen said the Trump administration wants to \"flat out lie about what this case is about\". \n\"If you want to make claims about \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, you should present them in the courts, not on social media,\" he said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was arrested by immigration authorities on 12 March in Baltimore, before being deported from Texas to El Salvador on 15 March.

Van Hollen said he was initially blocked from meeting Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by Salvadoran authorities. \"If he [Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda] ever ends up back in the United States, he would immediately be deported again,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.ReutersKilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last monthPresident Donald Trump told reporters at the White House Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was \"not a very innocent guy\".Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has faced at least two other allegations of criminal activity, neither of which resulted in a conviction.His wife alleged in a 2021 protective order request that he'd physically attacked her on multiple occasions, according to documents shared by the US Department of Homeland Security.Jennifer Vasquez Sura decided not to follow through with the court process, saying she and her husband were \"able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counselling\".A separate incident was reported in 2022, when Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was pulled over in Tennessee for allegedly speeding. Multiple judges - including a unanimous US Supreme Court ruling - said the government should facilitate Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's return to the US. \"He still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world,\" Van Hollen said.Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's case is part of a simmering showdown between the Trump administration and the US courts system on the issue of immigration.",

He's a serial winner. \nLevel on accolades with Lisbon Lions captain Billy McNeill, only Bobby Lennox and current team-mate James Forrest are ahead of him on the roll of honour.\nShould Celtic seal the Premiership title - they can do so on Saturday against Dundee United - Forrest will move ahead, on his own, as the most decorated Celt. \nRather than focus on his own player of the match performance, he was keen to heap praise on his long-time pal who has \"dedicated his life\" to the club. \nMcGregor, 31, is at the stage where reaching, and winning, finals is \"normal\".\nThe Celtic captain will now prepare for a 15th domestic cup final. He's never lost any of the previous 14. It's a winning feeling that he craves.\n\"If you ask any football player, success is addictive,\" he added. \"It becomes a habit. You just keep wanting more and that's what we're trying to instil in the team. \n\"When we get to these moments, they become normal. You have to win, you have to play well. \n\"So, as much as we can normalise that and keep being successful then hopefully that will keep the group in a good place.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWholesome moment as Jota celebrates with young fan\nNo matter Celtic's dominance in the last decade-plus, it's still frankly outrageous that winning has become so commonplace.\nBut such has been the way of it under Rodgers. The Northern Irishman is on the cusp of his own slice of history, as the first Celtic manager to oversee three trebles.\nHis first was secured in the most dramatic of fashions against Aberdeen in 2017, with Tom Rogic's extra-time goal clinching the Scottish Cup.\nSince then, what used to be a rare achievement has become a yearly target for Celtic, Rodgers and \"the glue\" to it all, McGregor.\nEven from afar, the understanding the pair have is evident. The manager fleetingly singles players out, but he's never shy to do so with his captain. \n\"He is such a unique player, the tempo setter for the team,\" Rodgers told BBC Scotland after the St Johnstone game. \"He's tactically so good, he really is a coach on the pitch. \n\"He sees all the pictures we want and he knows when to release himself to shoot or create goals. A wonderful player who is the glue for this team.\"\nWhen McGregor is missing - rare as that is - it's undeniably noticeable. See the defeat by Rangers last month for a recent example. \nBut with him, Celtic are a different animal.",

        "article_text": "For 16 generations, master gardeners in this one family have dedicated their lives to preserving one of the nation's most cherished \u2013 and highly sought-out \u2013 symbols.\nEach spring during sakura (cherry blossom) season, the Ninna-ji and Daikaku-ji temples in Kyoto's leafy Ukyo ward are overwhelmed by busloads of tourists who come to snap photos of the temples' blooming cherry trees. But little do they know that only a few kilometres away, there's a secret sakura garden hiding in plain sight.\nThis 1.5-hectare public plot, known as the Sano family garden, is an oasis of calm; found just off an unassuming street near traditional wooden machiya townhouses. But this isn't just any ordinary cherry blossom tree grove; it's also the domain of 97-year-old T\u014demon Sano: Japan's most renowned sakuramori (cherry blossom guardian).\nFor more than a millennium, Japanese people have admired the delicate sakura petals as a symbol of transience and beauty. Today, this national pastime has blossomed into an international obsession, with millions of tourists from across the world descending on Japan to sip seasonal sakura-themed Starbucks drinks and participate in hanami (cherry blossom viewing) picnics and festivals from March to May. But while the world waits with bated breath for the cotton candy-coloured blossoms to burst each spring, one of the most important and least understood roles in the trees' maintenance lies with their behind-the-scenes caretakers.\nAccording to Naoko Abe, cherry blossom expert and author of The Sakura Obsession, skilled sakura arborists have existed in Japan since time immemorial. But thanks to the popularity of the 1970s novel Sakuramori about a sakura-infatuated tree expert, communities began bestowing this title to deserving specialists in the years that followed. Typically a professional gardener or tree surgeon, a sakuramori is a combination of Lorax, botanist and spiritual guide dedicated to studying sakura and promoting their preservation.\nAs Asada Nobuyuki, the secretary general of the Japan Sakura Association, explained, there are roughly 100 sakuramori in Japan today, but one stands out. \"It can be said that T\u014demon Sano is most deserving of the title sakuramori,\" said Nobuyuki, crediting the breadth of Sano's long, productive career and his family's generational wisdom.\nOn a Friday morning earlier this month, I crunched through gravel at this historic sanctuary to meet Sano himself. He is the 16th generation in a distinguished line of farmers who began cultivating the nearby land (known for its late-blooming dwarf cherry trees) in the mid-1600s. When his father died in 1981, he assumed the first name T\u014demon, per family tradition, and took the reins of Uet\u014d Z\u014den, the landscaping firm his family started in 1832 that is headquartered in the garden.\nFor more than 80 years,Sano has utilised his specialised knowledge to steward the survival of sakura trees in gardens throughout Japan and the world \u2013 including at the Isamu Noguchi-designed Japanese garden at the Unesco headquarters in Paris. Sakura Taikan, his most famous book, is the definitive tome on the trees and the culmination of research begun by his grandfather during the\u00a0Taish\u014d period (1912\u20131926).\nBut just before our visit, the nonagenarian became ill and was rushed to hospital. Still, he arranged for me to meet his son, Shinichi Sano, who oversees operations at Uet\u014d Z\u014den and who will one day succeed his father and carry on the family legacy as the next T\u014demon and sakuramori.\nAs we strolled through the garden, Shinichi paused at an umbrella-like shidarezakura (weeping cherry), its swooping branches covered in geisha-blush blossoms. Shinichi said this 40-year-old tree was grown from the seeds of the most iconic sakura in Kyoto: the dramatic weeping cherry tree in Maruyama Park, which was originally grown in the Sano family garden and replanted in its current public spot by T\u014demon's father, the 15th T\u014demon Sano.\nThough sakura have attracted hanami lovers for generations, Shinichi said a major threat now looms over them: climate change. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, cherry blossoms have started to bloom 1.2 days earlier per decade since 1953. A recent study found that the peak bloom of Kyoto's cherry blossoms in 2020, 2021 and 2023 were the earliest in more than 1,200 years.\n\"If global warming continues at this rate, I believe there will eventually be regions in Japan where cherry trees no longer bloom,\" Shinichi said, noting that winters with elevated temperatures could nip blooms in the bud entirely, as trees require a sustained chill to initiate the blossoming process. If this happens, a major part of Japan's springtime tourism appeal would be jeopardised \u2013 as well as an integral part of the nation's cultural identity.\n\"The reason Japanese people are fond of cherry blossoms is because, after enduring a harsh winter, the vivid flowers bloom in the monochrome landscape as if to herald the long-awaited arrival of spring. This quiet presence is what draws people in and resonates deeply in our hearts,\" T\u014demon later told me over email after being released from hospital. \"Out of 365 days a year, the cherry blossoms endure wind and snow for 360 days, only to bloom gloriously for five days before gracefully scattering. I believe this fleeting yet dignified cycle reflects the Japanese perspective on life. There may be a sense of personification in the way we view the cherry blossom, as if it embodies a spiritual or moral belief that, through patience and perseverance, one will eventually bloom.\"\u00a0\nCherry blossoms are integral to the Japanese psyche and soul. In ancient Japan, kami (deities) were said to reside in the trees. Beginning in the 800s, Emperor Saga (whose former residence is up the road from the Sano family garden at Daikaku-ji) ushered in the practice of hanami with official cherry blossom viewing parties. For samurai during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), sakura became a unifying military symbol for the warriors to fall with dignity and grace \u2013 a message echoed during World War Two for kamikaze pilots. In light of this national importance, protecting sakura and ensuring their sustainability is something Japan takes seriously.\nToday, according to Abe, many of the most famous places travellers go to see sakura in Japan, such as Mount Yoshino in Nara and Matsumae Park in Hokkaido, each have a dedicated sakuramori. Interestingly, T\u014demon and his family's unbroken line of Japanese gardeners may not have risen to the level of sakuramori were it not for a British botanist.\nIn 1902, English naturalist Collingwood \"Cherry\" Ingram became fascinated by Japanese cherry trees during his first visit to the nation, but he lamented how industrialisation and cloning had led to a decline in their diversity. In an effort to protect them, he sent 50 endangered varieties back to England and planted them in his garden. When he eventually tried to propagate the varieties back in Japan come the 1930s, including the rare Taihaku cherry that had ceased to be cultivated in Japan, the trees didn't survive long.\nGiven the Sano family's generational expertise, Ingram sought out T\u014demon's grandfather, who developed a way to transport the trees successfully so they wouldn't sprout before arriving in Japan. From that little shipment of Taihaku trees, it is thought that tens of thousands of Tahihaku now flourish across Japan and were saved from national extinction.\nWhere to see T\u014demon Sano's sakura in Kyoto:\nIn addition to admiring T\u014demon's carefully cultivated sakura at Maruyama Park, the Ruriko-in estate, the Katsura and Shugauin imperial villas and the Ninna-ji Temple, visitors can also explore the Sano family garden year-round from 09:00 to 16:00 (best to call ahead at +81 75-871-4202).\nT\u014demon's grandfather became something of a Johnny Appleseed for sakura \u2013 taking grafts and growing saplings, venturing to far-flung places like the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin before he died in 1934. T\u014demon's father then took up the mantle while training his son to continue the family legacy.\nToday, travellers enjoying the mesmerising weeping cherry in Maruyama Park have T\u014demon to thank, as the city asks him to care for the tree throughout the year. Visitors can also admire T\u014demon's work at the Ruriko-in estate, where sakura stand in stunning harmony on the property close to the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji; the Katsura Imperial Villa; the Shukaguin Imperial Villa; Ninna-ji Temple garden; and, of course, at the nearby Sano family property.\nEven at 97,\u00a0T\u014demon still collects information on different types of sakura and makes detailed drawings of the blossoms' anatomy from the stamen and pistils to the bracts and peduncles \u2013 all to better understand how to help sakura flourish.\n\"My feelings toward cherry blossoms are something that has been ingrained in my daily life,\" T\u014demon said. \"My daily life follows the old Japanese way of life seik\u014d-udoku, 'working in the fields when it's sunny and reading when it rains'\u2026 If I am asked to preserve rare cherry blossoms, I respond by grafting or sowing seeds.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 96-year-old painter who saved a village\u00a0\n\u2022 The 89-year-old woman who is still travelling the world solo\n\u2022 Japan's unusual way to view the world\nTo that end, he has successfully propagated cherry trees in the atomic bomb-ravaged soil of Hiroshima and saved a 150-year-old Oshima cherry tree in Yokohama that was destined to be cut down. In that instance, when the local community enlisted him to relocate the storied sakura 100m away to preserve an iconic view of Mt Fuji, he took careful stock of the three layers of soil surrounding the tree. Before digging, T\u014demon ceremonially placed sake and rice crackers in the dirt as an apology for the disruption, added charcoal and provided an octopus offering. Also known to hug trees, T\u014demon embraced the trunk tightly upon its successful replanting.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs I toured the Sano family garden, falling\u00a0cherry petals fluttered to the ground like snowflakes, a phenomenon called sakura fubuki. In addition to kami, the souls of ancestors are also said to reside in the flowering cherry blossoms, connecting\u00a0the Sano family to their forebearers and representing the fleeting nature of each generation.\u00a0Amid this transient beauty, the Japanese concept of\u00a0\"mono no aware\" (the wistful recognition of life's ephemerality and the beauty in that impermanence) feels especially present.\u00a0\n\"Cherry blossoms reflect the way of life of the samurai in the old days: beautiful in the way they fall with grace and dignity,\" Shinichi said. Shinichi's 38-year-old son, Tomoaki, who has started to take over day-to-day responsibilities in the family business, has one child \u2013 a daughter. It would then be possible to have the first female sakuramori in this line.\n\"It will depend on her decision,\" Shinichi said.\nFor now, though, the family is allowing the 16th T\u014demon Sano to focus his attentions on what he does best.\n\"While my father is healthy, he will be the one to take care of the sakura,\" Shinichi said. I then asked if he felt he would one day be ready to assume the role of T\u014demon Sano and sakuramori.\u00a0\n\"I won't really know until I actually become the 17th generation,\" Shinichi said. \"I think I will truly feel the responsibility for the first time when I actually inherit the name\u2026 I'll do what I'm asked to.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated.

This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "In April 1983, a German magazine, Stern, and a British newspaper, The Sunday Times, claimed to have made one of the century's most extraordinary historical discoveries. In fact, it was one of the century's most extraordinary hoaxes \u2013 and the scandal that followed cost millions and ruined reputations.\nOn 25 April 1983, 42 years ago this week, respected German magazine Stern published what they believed to be the most spectacular historical scoop: the previously unknown private diaries of Adolf Hitler. To show off their extraordinary exclusive to the world's press, the weekly news magazine had arranged a Hamburg press conference for the same day. The story would indeed dominate global headlines \u2013 but not in the way the magazine hoped.\nThree days earlier, Stern's London editor Peter Wickman had told BBC News that they were \"absolutely convinced\" that they had the authentic Hitler diaries in their hands. \"We were very dubious at the beginning, but we had a graphologist looking at them, we had an expert who compared the paper. We had historians like Professor Trevor-Roper, and they are all convinced they are genuine.\"\nThe handwritten journals ran from 1932 to 1945, covering the entire period of Hitler's Third Reich. \"There are 60 diaries, they look a bit like school exercise books but with a hard cover. They have seals outside with a swastika and an eagle and inside, of course, Hitler's very spidery gothic handwriting,\" Wickman told the BBC.\nStern believed that their discovery had the potential to rewrite what was previously known about the Nazi leader. And the diaries' content was certainly eye-opening, revealing a little-known sensitive side to the F\u00fchrer. They detailed everything from Hitler's battles with flatulence and halitosis, and the pressure from his girlfriend Eva Braun to get Olympics tickets, to notes about sending Stalin \u2013 \"the old fox\" \u2013 a birthday telegram. The notebooks also seemed to indicate, somewhat startlingly, that the Nazi leader was unaware of the Holocaust that was being carried out in his name.\u00a0\nThe journals had supposedly been unearthed by Stern journalist Gerd Heidemann. The reporter was already regarded around Stern as something of a Nazi memorabilia obsessive. In 1973, the magazine had assigned him to write a story about a dilapidated yacht which had once belonged to Hitler's second-in-command, Hermann G\u00f6ring. Heidemann spent a fortune buying the yacht and restoring it. He also began an affair with G\u00f6ring's daughter Edda, who introduced him to a number of former Nazis. It was through these contacts, Heidemann said, that he had come across Hitler's diaries.\nHeidemann claimed that the plane had been carrying the diaries, which were salvaged from the crash and stowed away in a hayloft. In the intervening years, they had found their way to an East German collector who was now offering to sell them. The reporter would negotiate the deal to buy them, acting as intermediary between his East German source and Stern.\nThe promise of a sensational world exclusive, providing previously unknown insight into the mind of the Nazi dictator, proved irresistible to the magazine. But Stern was determined to keep a tight grip on who knew about their scoop, so when they hired handwriting experts to authenticate the diaries \u2013 providing them with \"genuine\" Hitler documents for comparison \u2013 they would only give them a few selected pages of the notebooks to look at. Stern ultimately forked out some 9.3 million Deutschmarks (\u00a32.3m) for the volumes, and, having paid such an exorbitant sum, opted to store them in a Swiss vault for safekeeping.\nThe first historian to examine the diaries was Prof Hugh Trevor-Roper, also known as Lord Dacre of Glanton. In 1947, he had written a book, The Last Days of Hitler, which had brought him a great deal of academic prestige, and he was regarded as a leading expert on the Nazi dictator. He was also an independent director of The Times newspaper, which two years earlier had been acquired along with its sister paper, The Sunday Times, by Rupert Murdoch.\nLord Dacre was initially sceptical about the diaries, but flew to Switzerland to view them. His opinion began to be swayed when he heard the diaries' origin story and was told, erroneously, that chemical tests had found them to be pre-war. But what really tipped the balance for the historian was seeing the huge volume of material involved.\u00a0\n\"The thing that struck Hugh Trevor-Roper most forcefully and certainly struck me as a non-expert when I saw the original material was the sheer scale of it,\" The Times editor Charles Douglas-Home told the BBC on 22 April 1983. \"The enormous range of this archive. It's not just that there are nearly 60 volumes of notebooks filled out in Hitler's longhand which is there, there are about 300 of his drawings and pictures and personal documents such as his party card. I remember there are the drawings which he submitted to art school when he was a young man hoping to get into art school, and there is a painting, an oil painting and so on. Now a forger would have to be very good to forge across that whole range.\"\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nLord Dacre became convinced that the journals were genuine, even writing an article for The Times vouching for their authenticity and declaring that historic events might need to be re-evaluated in light of them. As word got out about the Hitler diaries, a bidding war developed over their serialisation rights, with The Sunday Times proprietor, Murdoch, flying over to Zurich to negotiate a deal in person.\nWith serialisation deals signed, Stern hastily planned a press conference to announce the publication of Hitler's diaries to the world. But even before the notebooks' grand reveal, doubts were being raised about their veracity \u2013 not least by the staff of The Sunday Times themselves, who had been burnt before. In 1968, the newspaper had made a down payment on diaries supposedly written by the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, which had also been vouched for, by his son no less. \"But they turned out to be fakes devised by two little old ladies who lived in Vercelli outside Milan,\" journalist Phillip Knightley, who worked for The Sunday Times's investigative team, told Witness History in 2011.\nHowever, Murdoch was certain about the diaries and, despite the reservations of its editor, Frank Giles, rushed the serialisation into print in The Sunday Times with the headline \"world exclusive\" the day before Stern's press announcement.\nGiles rang Lord Dacre seeking reassurance about the story only to have the historian confess that he was not so much having doubts as making \"a 180-degree turn\" regarding the diaries' authenticity. \"Everybody in the room, all the newspaper executives slumped down in their chairs and put their heads in their hands because we had lost our principal authenticator,\" said Knightley. \"It was clear that the story was absolutely wrong.\"\nThe Sunday Times could still have stopped the presses and changed the front page. But when Giles rang the proprietor, \"Murdoch said, 'Just because Dacre has been vacillating for all this time, screw him, we'll publish,'\" recalls Knightley.\nFor Stern, things would just get worse at its\u00a0news conference\u00a0the next day. After editor-in-chief Peter Koch declared that he was \"100% convinced that Hitler wrote every single word in those books\", Lord Dacre, the very historian who had vouched they were the real deal, admitted under questioning that he was having second thoughts.\nTo the horrified looks of the Stern executives, Lord Dacre said that he wasn't able to establish a link between the plane crash and the alleged diaries and that he had been rushed into making a judgement. \"I must say as a historian, I regret that the normal methods of historical verification have, perhaps necessarily, been to some extent sacrificed to the requirements of the journalistic scoop,\" he said.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The true story of The Great Escape\n\u2022 The British politician who faked his own death\n\u2022 How Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jewish people in WW2\nThe day after the chaotic press conference, Charles Hamilton, a US autographs dealer, told BBC Breakfast that as soon he saw the diaries' pages he \"could smell the ebullient odour of forgeries\". Hamilton said that he knew the signature wasn't authentic because he was constantly offered fake Hitler documents. \"Shortly it will be established without any question, and without any panel of experts which I think is superfluous at the present time, the whole affair will die down and it will be a great hoax in the history of mankind,\" he said.\nAnd he was not wrong. Within two weeks, rigorous forensic analysis had exposed the diaries as fakes. Not only, as Hamilton had pointed out to the BBC, was Hitler's supposed signature not accurate, but chemical testing revealed that their paper, glue and ink were not manufactured until after World War Two. The diaries were peppered with errors, modern-day phrases and historical inaccuracies, sometimes referring to information that Hitler could not have possibly known.\nIn the wake of these revelations The Sunday Times quickly abandoned its serialisation and printed an apology. Stern also publicly apologised for having fallen for the hoax.\nUnder pressure, Heidemann revealed that the East German source supplying the diaries was Konrad Kujau \u2013 a counterfeiter who turned out to be the author of the works. Kujau was a skilled artist, but his forgeries were far from sophisticated. Seeking inspiration, he had plagiarised large parts of Max Domarus's book Hitler: Speeches and Proclamations 1932-1945, and as a result had copied word for word some of the chronological and factual mistakes in that book's first edition. To try to give the journals a more personal feel, he had imagined a more prosaic side to the F\u00fchrer's life, throwing in entries like \"I can't even get off work and visit Eva\", \"Have to go to the post office, to send a few telegrams\", and \"Eva says I have bad breath\". Kujau had even struggled with the elaborate Gothic initials he used on the diary covers, accidentally sticking the initials FH to them instead of AH. He had then attempted to age the notebooks by merely pouring tea over them and bashing them on his desk.\u00a0\nWhat helped with the initial authentication of the diaries was that Kujau was such a prolific forger of Nazi memorabilia that many of the \"genuine\" documents Stern had given to experts, to enable them to compare Hitler's handwriting, had actually also been produced by Kujau himself. He was arrested by the police and admitted to his role in the hoax. He even went so far as to demonstrate his guilt by writing his confession in the style of Hitler's handwriting. In 1985, he was found guilty of fraud and forgery and sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison.\u00a0\nOn further investigation, the police found Heidemann had also inflated the prices he said his source was requesting for the diaries, and had been skimming money off the top of the sums paid by Stern. He seems to have done this to fund his lavish lifestyle, the upkeep of his Nazi yacht and his penchant for buying ever more dictators' memorabilia (he would later claim to possess Idi Amin's underwear). He, like Kujau, was convicted in 1985 of fraud and was sentenced to four years, eight months. At his trial, Heidemann maintained that he too had been duped, but Kujau always insisted that the reporter knew the diaries were fakes.\u00a0\nIn the fallout from the scandal, Lord Dacre's reputation as a historian would be permanently tarnished. Koch and another of Stern's editors would lose their jobs, while Giles would be removed from his role as The Sunday Times editor. Even Murdoch would later claim to the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in 2012 that his decision to run with the story \"was a major mistake I made, I take full responsibility for it. I will have to live with it for the rest of my life.\"\nHowever, his newspaper's circulation was boosted by his decision to print the false story. And since Murdoch had insisted on a clause that Stern return all the money paid to it by The Sunday Times if the diaries were shown to be fake, the media mogul would only profit financially from the hoax.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.  \nThe discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.\nNow researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.\nAnother unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.\n\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.\nAbout half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.\nSo far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.\n\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.\n\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\" \nThe skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.\n\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.\n\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"\nArtefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.\nShards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.\n\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.\n\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"\nThe presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.\nThe team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.\nThey have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.\nOsteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s. \nHer skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.\n\nTen of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.\nThe results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.\nFurther DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.\nThe team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.\nBecause of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.\n\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.\n\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"\nThe dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.\nAndy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.\n\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.\n\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"\nBut for the moment there are still many contradictions that remain unsolved.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

It's been something I've asked every single year, but it never really made sense,\" says Yee, the most decorated Olympic triathlete in history.\n\"This time we were trying to think what would get me to LA [2028 Olympics] in the best place mentally and physically. It was important to freshen things up.\n\"It's been really exciting to work on my running after five years of trying to make my swim and bike an appropriate level to be competitive in triathlon. It's something I've wanted to do and I'm excited to scratch that itch.\" \nLondon Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know\n'Our daughters will be with us', say dads of Southport victims running London Marathon\nAlex Yee overturned a 15-second deficit to rival Hayden Wilde in the final 2.5km to win a dramatic Olympic men's triathlon gold at Paris 2024\nIt should be no surprise that Yee, an athlete obsessed with the process of improvement as much as the success it brings, has relished this new challenge. \nHe speaks about his first marathon training block with a beaming smile and is not ruling out another in future - although a return to triathlon is scheduled for early 2026 at the latest.\n\"To have something which has given me that purpose to get out of bed, to go out and keep searching for those fine margins, I think that's really rare to find in the first year after an Olympics when you hear of athletes soul searching and not knowing what to do,\" says Yee.\n\"To be an expert on something, you have to be once a fool. That's the way I'm seeing it. I wanted to go in with an open mind and come out the other side as a better runner - but also better holistically.\n\"It's been really interesting to learn from so many people and feel like a novice again.\"\nYee is part of a stellar elite men's field featuring 10 athletes who have run the marathon in under two hours and five minutes, including one of his sporting idols in four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge.\nThere is also Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, defending champion Alexander Mutiso Munyao, and debutant Jacob Kiplimo - who in February became the first person to run a half marathon in under 57 minutes. \nYee's target? Enjoy the experience - and go through halfway in 64 minutes and 30 seconds. \nThat would give him the chance to become only the 10th British man to run under 2:09, while only 22 have broken 2:10.\nRunning is Yee's strongest discipline and he has competed for Great Britain on the track and in cross-country, while his 5km best of 13:26 is the third-fastest ever by a British man.\n\"It would be a massive honour to, hopefully, be in that ballpark of people who have achieved amazing things,\" says Yee.\n\"I think it's going to be an amazing day for the Brits but also a historic day at the front. Hopefully I can say I was part of a sub-two hour marathon race.\"\nAlex Yee will meet Eliud Kipchoge, whose most recent London Marathon victory came in 2019, after Sunday's race\nTo Yee's astonishment, Kipchoge was among those to offer him advice and said in January that he would like to meet and help mentor the Briton when they are in London.\nSo the former mini marathon runner and Kenya's two-time Olympic champion have arranged to meet after the race.\nIn the meantime, Kipchoge, widely regarded as the greatest distance runner of all time, has offered wisdom via WhatsApp - something Yee describes as \"surreal\".\n\"His big piece of advice was to get to the start line. It sounded silly at the time, but after unfortunately seeing people forced to pull out, it's probably the strongest piece of advice of all,\" says Yee.\nThey are likely to have much to discuss. \nBoth are passionate about using the power of sport to inspire, with Yee now keen to utilise his platform as Olympic champion.\nHe intends to provide opportunities to school children through the launch of his own foundation, initially in the south London area he grew up in.\nYee also hopes documenting his marathon journey on YouTube can demonstrate that elite athletes are not \"superhuman\", before he stars on the other side of the barriers he used to watch behind. \n\"The more we share our story I feel like people realise that we're just like anyone else, and there's no reason why they can't dream to achieve what I have - or even so much more,\" says Yee.\n\"You start to feel this urgency with the fortunate position I'm in, being an Olympic champion, that I can and I want to make a difference. \n\"I'm not expecting to leave this big legacy behind. If I can change one person's life, that's good enough for me.\"",

        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.
