I thought Henrik was five metres in front of me. When you're in a line you can't really tell what is going on. I was pushing every bit of me to the line,\" Azu, who has returned his training to the UK following the birth of his son, told BBC Sport.\n\"I know I'm in the right place and this confirmed to me that I've made the right decisions. This is just the start of the journey for us as a team. We are coming to take it all and I'm excited to be on this journey now.\"\nAzu becomes the ninth British man to win the title - and first since Richard Kilty won back-to-back titles in 2017.\nPodium finishes for Azu and Robertson follow the bronze medals won by 1500m runner Revee Walcott-Nolan and the mixed 4x400m relay quartet.\nIt is a first individual international medal for 34-year-old Robertson, who received a late call-up to the squad and finished fourth in 2021.\n\"This time last week I was having a cheesecake, I was having a great time with my family in Scarborough,\" Robertson joked.\n\"I got the call on Wednesday to be a reserve but I was always prepared [to compete] because it has been my goal for a long time. Aged 34, to come away with my second-fastest time ever, I can't ask for any more.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'This time last week I was eating cheesecake in Scarborough' - Robertson on 60m bronze\nAzu had a taste of gold on the international stage as part of Britain's team at the 2022 European Championships in Munich, where 100m bronze represented his first senior individual medal at that level.\nBut despite playing his part in Team GB's 4x100m relay bronze at Paris 2024 last summer, Azu has since described the experience of his first Olympic Games as \"bittersweet\" after he was disqualified from the individual event for a false start.\nHe has since taken the significant decision to switch his training set-up after starting his family, leaving Marco Airale's group in Italy to return home to Cardiff and reunite with former coach Helen James.\nThe young Welshman, who retained his British indoor 60m title in February, already appears to be benefitting from that move, now back under the guidance of the coach who encouraged him to take up the sport as a teenager.\nA two-time European under-23 100m champion, Azu will now target a first individual podium on the global stage at the World Indoor Championships in Nanjing, China this month.\nJeremiah Azu is a two-time European under-23 100m champion\n\"Speechless. It has been a crazy couple of months. To top it off by becoming European champion, I'm so grateful to god,\" Azu said.\n\"Life is such a flash and it is so great to have these moments. I am so grateful to be standing here and calling myself a European champion.\"\nBritish debutant John Otugade exited at the semi-final stage on Saturday, finishing fifth in his race in 6.67 secs.\nElsewhere on the penultimate night of action, Ireland's Mark English qualified for Sunday's men's 800m final, running one minute 45.89 seconds for third place in his semi-final, but British debutant Justin Davies missed out.\nThe British team will have several opportunities to add to their medal tally on the final day of competition in Apeldoorn.\nBritain's George Mills will aim to deny Jakob Ingebrigtsen a fourth consecutive men's 3,000m title, which would mean the Norwegian matching the men's record of seven European indoor titles.\nFresh from his 1500m triumph, Ingebrigtsen coasted to victory in his heat and will be the strong favourite to complete a third consecutive 1500m and 3,000m double.\nHowever, Mills, son of former England international footballer Danny, will line up as the fastest European 3,000m runner this year and controlled his heat to reach the final, where he is joined by team-mate James West.\nGeorge Mills won 5,000m silver behind Jakob Ingebrigtsen at last year's European Championships\nThree British athletes qualified for the women's final, with two-time bronze medallist Melissa Courtney-Bryant, the fastest European woman this year, joined by 18-year-old debutant Innes FitzGerald and Hannah Nuttall.\nMorgan Lake will target her first international medal since the 2018 Commonwealth Games in the women's high jump final, in which Ukraine's Olympic champion and world record holder Yaroslava Mahuchikh goes for a third consecutive title.\nGB captain Scott Lincoln will aim to qualify for the men's shot put final during the morning session, while Jade O'Dowda contests the women's pentathlon, and sprinters Bianca Williams, Joy Eze and Amy Hunt bid for women's 60m medals.\nRelay honours are also up for grabs in the men's and women's 4x400m finals, with Dutch star Femke Bol aiming to bring the curtain down with a second gold at her home championships.\nCoverage of the final day of action begins at 09:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC Sport website and app.\nHow to watch European Indoor Championships",

It's so surreal.\"\nLike former entrants Sam Ryder and Mae Muller, they credit TikTok with getting their break.\nThey've got more than half a million followers on the app with a combined 11.3 million likes across their videos.\n\"It really has changed our lives - without sounding too dramatic,\" Charlotte says. \n\"We started posting in lockdown and when we came out we put on a gig, our first one in a long time, and it sold out in like 24 hours.\"\nThey thought it was their families who \"spent a lot of money on tickets\".\n\"We walked out on stage and we didn't recognise anyone - it was all new faces.\n\"It was that gig that spurred us on to do this full-time.\"\nIt's only been about 18 months since they decided to take the plunge and focus fully on the band but they go back much further. \nFirst meeting at school in Hampshire, the trio used to skip classes to practise instead.\n\"We have been singing for years and years for fun because we adore singing with each other,\" says Holly-Anne. \n\"It's our version of shopping or getting our nails done.\"\nThey hope that legacy of friendship will be the secret to going the distance in this year's competition.\n\"We have each other, we are best mates, we're each other's therapists.\"\nRemember Monday also marks the first time since a girl group has represented the UK in more than 25 years and podcast host Rob thinks this might give them an edge too.\n\"It's going to be really exciting to follow their journey all the way through to Switzerland.\n\"I don't know if Remember Monday are going to win Eurovision, there are so many different things there at play - but I think we've got a good chance,\" he says.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

But when it comes to ticket prices, there is unity.\n\"We are all fighting the same fight on ticket prices,\" said Manchester United Supporters' Trust CEO Duncan Drasdo.\n\"Clubs are exploiting loyalty and fans are united in saying enough is enough.\"\nWhen 19 of the Premier League's 20 clubs raised their ticket prices before the 2024-25 season, the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) launched a campaign called 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty'.\nThose protests have grown again this season, with some clubs removing concessionary discounts for the elderly and young people - and teams like Arsenal announcing increases for 2025-26.\nThe cost of competing for trophies, increasing operational expenses, and the threat of complying with financial regulations, have all been given as reasons for price hikes.\nBBC Sport has analysed a new Uefa report showing the league's financial power and how much clubs make from tickets - but also the challenge of increased staffing levels and expensive running costs.\nPremier League clubs made a total of almost 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) from selling tickets to home matches in 2023, Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report shows.\nThat figure is growing by about 10% per year, and is almost double that of Spain's  La Liga (\u00a3481m) and Germany's Bundesliga (\u00a3430m).\nThe report uses a mixture of full financial reporting of more than 700 clubs for 2023, plus 2024 figures from 130 of Europe's biggest clubs.\nOf the 10 clubs who generated the most income from gate receipts in 2024, six are English.\nThe same six Premier League clubs feature in the top 12 for another ticketing metric, which measures the money earned per fan, per ticket.\n\"What the figures show is that English top-flight clubs are doing very well financially in a whole number of different metrics,\" says Tom Greatrex, chair of the FSA.\n\"Healthy ticket revenue shows people are wanting to go - but also shows the ratcheting up of ticket prices in the past few years. That is manifesting itself in the protests and disenchantment we've seen.\"\nThe report also points out that \"stadium expansions and/or increases in premium seating and hospitality have also doubled gate revenues at Paris St-Germain, Bayern [Munich], Liverpool and Manchester City since 2009\".\nArsenal and Tottenham's positions are helped by sales of high-value hospitality seats at modern stadiums in London - one of the world's most-visited cities.\n\"What we have seen clubs do through stadium expansion is a huge focus on those seats being hospitality,\" says Dan Plumley, senior lecturer in sport finance at Sheffield Hallam University. \n\"On a basic financial level it makes sense, because you can generate more from that than a baseline seat. \n\"But if that is stopping your more average fan getting a ticket, that is something clubs are going to have to grapple with.\"\nThe report states the average amount made per fan from tickets is \u00a329-\u00a337 \"for the majority of clubs\".\nFans from four rival clubs to protest at ticket prices\nMan Utd fans criticise ticket prices - as club reveals manager change costs\nPremier League ticket price rises - what the fans think\nThe Uefa report paints a similar picture to other research such as the annual Deloitte Money League - with Premier League clubs bringing in far more revenue  (\u00a36.2bn in 2023) than other European leagues.\nHowever, English clubs reported a combined loss of \u00a3728m before tax.\nTV rights deals are showing signs of plateauing, so clubs need to maximise matchday income and commercial and sponsorship revenues to try to offset significant spending on transfers, wages and running costs in order to turn a profit.\nThe report outlines some eye-watering spending figures:\nPremier League clubs spent \u00a34bn on player wages in 2023, almost double second-placed Spain (\u00a32.1bn).\nFour European clubs have squads that cost more than 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) to assemble by the end of 2024, and all are English - Chelsea (1.7bn euros/\u00a31.4bn), Manchester City (1.3bn euros/\u00a31.1bn), Manchester United (1.1bn euros/\u00a3920m), and Arsenal (1bn euros/\u00a3840m).\nChelsea's 2024 squad was found to be \"comfortably the most expensive ever assembled\", 24% higher than the previous record - the 2020 Real Madrid squad. The report also says Chelsea spent almost 2bn euros (\u00a31.7bn) in transfer fees in the five-year period to 2024.\nFour of the five most profitable clubs - by pre-tax profits - in 2024 were German: Bayern (\u00a353m), Borussia Dortmund (\u00a341m), Lazio (\u00a334m), Leipzig (\u00a331m), Eintracht Frankfurt (\u00a327m).\nThree of the five least profitable clubs in 2024 - by pre-tax losses - were English: Juventus (\u00a3164m), Chelsea (\u00a393m), Aston Villa (\u00a384m), Roma (\u00a363m), Liverpool (\u00a355m).\nPlumley says: \"Each individual club will have its own reasons for doing it, but raising ticket prices doesn't shift the dial massively in terms of the overall picture of the finances.\n\"I get that costs have gone up, we understand that side of the equation, but this is where it really grinds with fans.\"\nFans of some clubs have been contesting the loss of concessionary tickets for the elderly, juniors, and disabled supporters\nManchester United's controversial plans to make up to 450 redundancies,, external cut about 39% of its workforce and \"return the club to profitability\" have put a sharper focus on how many people are actually needed to run a football club - and the operating costs involved.\nWhile transfer spending remains a club's biggest outgoing, the report says high inflation in areas such as utilities, plus the wages spent on more employees to expand commercial activity, is biting. \nOperating costs have risen by 12% across Europe, with a total of \u00a31.5bn spent in the Premier League in 2023, almost \u00a3500m higher than second-placed Germany\nOperating costs plus non-player wages absorb just under half the revenue of big-five European league clubs\nIn 2024, six Premier League teams featured in the top 10 for money spent on operating costs.\n\"Operations costs have increased - that's fair,\" Greatrex says. \"But increasing ticket prices way beyond the level of inflation, year after year, which is what has started to happen with most clubs in the Premier League - and then trying to claim that PSR or financial fair play are the reason - is the clubs treating people as though they're idiots.\"\nSalaries paid to non-footballer staff members have also risen sharply.\nThe average top 20 club in Europe has 970 full-time employees - Barcelona have the most with 1,781\nFour Premier League teams have more than 1,000 full-time employees - Man Utd, Brighton, Liverpool and Man City\nPremier League clubs employed a total of 11,081 full-time employees by the end of 2023\nEnglish top-flight clubs paid a total of \u00a31bn in non-player wages in 2023. That total, which includes wages paid to staff members such as coaches, media departments and ticket office personnel, is more than twice that of second-placed Germany\nThere was 19% inflation on non-player wages across Europe in 2023 and for the biggest clubs, head coach wages rose on average 21% in 2024\nThat compares to a more modest average growth of 4.5% in player wages in 2024, which the report said was \"essential for financial stability as clubs struggle with strong inflation\".\nThe logic behind the rise in staffing numbers varies per club. Brighton, for example, employ a notoriously vast recruitment and scouting operation.\nThe report states that employee growth can be explained by clubs' desire to wring more from commercial and sponsorship deals.\nAcross Europe, income from commercial and sponsorship deals has risen by 39% since 2019.\n\"Commercial income is almost untapped in terms of potential and there is no restriction on the number of deals you can sign,\" Plumley says. \n\"But you have to throw more resource at that.\n\"There are more roles now in football clubs than ever before. Some of them are quite forward thinking.\n\"It's a natural consequence of how the game has evolved, because everyone is pushing for growth, growth, growth.\"",

        "article_text": "Forty years ago, Northern English poet Harrison published a powerful work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds. Then, when it was screened on TV in 1987, a national furore erupted.\n\"FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY\" thundered the front page of one British newspaper, condemning the \"cascade of expletives\". \"FROM BAD TO VERSE\" was the headline of another article, that quoted a Conservative Member of Parliament questioning whether the said poem \"serves any artistic purpose whatsoever\". And a group of particularly exercised MPs called for a debate in the House of Commons.\nThe furore was about a poem called V by northern English poet Tony Harrison \u2013 a work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds \u2013 which was originally published in January 1985, but really became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre when it was screened on national television in the UK two years later, in November 1987.\nIt is not often a poem becomes a hot topic of conversation among the general public. The last time it happened was four years ago when Amanda Gorman read her poem The Hill We Climb at Joe Biden's presidential inauguration, although the poet's youth and outfit excited as much comment as her verse. Before that, it was WH Auden's Funeral Blues, after it featured in the hit 1994 romcom Four Weddings and a Funeral.\u00a0\nBut if it is unusual for a poem to escape the confines of the world of literature, it's virtually unheard of for one to provoke angry newspaper headlines, and prompt politicians to demand action and members of the public to furiously call TV channels.\u00a0\nV had its origins in a visit by Harrison to Holbeck Cemetery in Beeston, Leeds, in May 1984. The cemetery stands on a hill \u2013 beneath which there are worked-out mine seams \u2013 and overlooks both Elland Road, home of Leeds United Football Club, and the University of Leeds, where Harrison, a poet and playwright, had studied Classics and Linguistics. Harrison, there to tend his parents' graves, found the cemetery strewn with beer cans and gravestones defaced by spray-painted graffiti \u2013 four-letter words, racist abuse, swastikas and a series of \"V\" letters. The nature of some of the graffiti suggested football fans were responsible.\nAt this time, unemployment was soaring, and went on to reach 11.9% later that year, a level not seen in the UK since 1971 \u2013 and not seen since. The previous year, an award-winning BBC drama, The Boys from the Blackstuff, about unemployed tarmac-layers in Liverpool, had captured the zeitgeist and made a huge impact. The Miners' Strike had started some weeks earlier. In fact, the country was deeply divided under a polarising Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher. In the vandalism and the spray-painted daubings, Harrison saw further evidence of societal division, and it gave him the idea for his poem.\nHarrison was, at this point, an established and well-respected poet, playwright and translator. He had published several volumes of verse and been the resident dramatist at the National Theatre, while his 1973 translation of Moli\u00e8re's The Misanthrope had won great acclaim.\nOn 24 January 1985, V was published in the London Review of Books.\nIt consists of 112 four-line stanzas, or quatrains, with an ABAB rhyming scheme, the same form as Thomas Gray's celebrated 18th-Century poem Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, which Harrison sought to evoke in contrast with his own work.\nThe \"V\" of the title stands for \"versus\" \u2013 which is also a pun on \"verses\" \u2013 but maybe also for \"victory\", and perhaps it is further intended to refer to the two-fingered \"V sign\" gesture considered rude in British culture.\nOne verse reads:\nThese Vs are all the versuses of life\nfrom LEEDS v. DERBY, Black/White\nand (as I've known to my cost) man v. wife, \nCommunist v. Fascist, Left v. Right.\nThe poem imagines the poet engaging in a dialogue with the person who has defaced the graves, and it features the obscenities and racist epithets used in the graffiti.\n\"We didn't need Harrison to tell us then that Britain was divided, and we don't now, but\u00a0V was a powerful articulation of those divisions and some of their causes,\" says Sandie Byrne, Professor of English at the University of Oxford.\u00a0\n\"The football supporter who, taking a shortcut through the cemetery, takes out his rage on the gravestones, is treated sympathetically, albeit with aggressive language to match his own. The Harrison figure understands the frustration of the third-generation unemployed among headstones celebrating lifelong professions.\n\"The poem's power and endurance come from its energy, the impetus of the verse and the language, its anger, and its use of the personal in the service of the political.\"\nV did not appear to cause any outrage when first printed in the London Review of Books. It was subsequently published in book form by Bloodaxe Books in November 1985 and, again, troubled neither the UK's legislature nor its newspapers.\u00a0Neil\u00a0Astley, founder of Bloodaxe Books, and still the publisher's editor and managing director, recalls that, soon after the publication of the poem as a book, \u00a0Harrison performed the entire thing in a late-night arts slot on Tyne Tees Television, which catered specifically to audiences in North East England, and \"it went out without arousing any opposition as far as I'm aware\".\nBut then in 1987, it became known that a televised version of the poem had been made for national broadcaster Channel 4, directed by celebrated theatre director Richard Eyre and featuring Harrison reading the poem along with footage of, among other things, striking miners, Holbeck Cemetery and Thatcher doing a \"victory\" sign. At that point, all hell broke loose.\nIn October, a few weeks before its broadcast, the Daily Mail reported on the \"FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY\" on its front page. The activist and anti-obscenity campaigner Mary Whitehouse called the poem a \"work of singular nastiness\". Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth, who earlier that year had attempted to introduce legislation that would make it a crime to air material that might cause \"gross offence\" to a \"reasonable person\", was another who opposed its broadcast. He officially called for a debate in the House of Commons to try to stop it. One hundred and twenty one MPs signed the proposal. Howarth later admitted he had not read the poem in full. Harrison recalled in the 2013 BBC Radio 4 documentary, Exploring V, that at the height of the furore, a reporter from the Telegraph knocked on his door. \"I said, 'Have you read the poem?'\u2019 He said,'No. I'm New'.\"\nOpposition to the TV programme came principally from right wing commentators but the Sunday Telegraph columnist and editor of the Literary Review, Auberon Waugh, whom no-one had ever mistaken for a left winger, found the poem \"well written and extremely moving\", as he wrote in his Telegraph column at the time. Ian Hislop, the editor of UK satirical magazine Private Eye, wrote an article defending it in The Listener, as did Bernard Levin in the Times, calling it \"powerful, profound and haunting\". And the Independent printed the whole poem in its news pages, with an introduction by Blake Morrison in which he wrote: \"Those MPs are right to believe that the poem is shocking but not because of its language. It shocks because it describes unflinchingly what is meant by a divided society, because it takes the abstractions we have learned to live with \u2013 unemployment, racial tension, inequality, deprivation \u2013\u00a0and gives them a kind of physical existence on the page.\"\nThe film was broadcast at 11pm on Channel 4 on Wednesday 4 November 1987. According to the logs of the Channel 4 staff on the switchboard \u2013 which were reproduced in the appendix of Bloodaxe's second edition of the poem, along with many of the newspaper and magazine articles about the furore \u2013 there were several calls from viewers irate at the \"disgusting language\". But others approved. Mr K of Watford suggested \"politicians should address their energies into the social problems featured in the poem\". Mr W of London said: \"I am so moved the tears are running down my cheeks\". The majority of calls were in favour of the broadcast.\n\"The irony is, of course, that while Bloodaxe had sold a couple of thousand copies of the poem before 1987, as a result of the attacks on the Channel 4 film, V reached an audience of millions who might otherwise never have heard of it,\" Astley tells the BBC. \"And if you read the poem today, it feels every bit as vital and relevant as it was 40 years ago.\"\nSandie Byrne says: \"I remember friends reading about the poem in the press, and assuming that it was just a meretricious piece studded with swear words by a shock jock seeking attention. Others picked up that it mentioned [miners' leader] Arthur Scargill, and showed scenes of the miners' strike, and assumed that those were its only subjects. Even among those who actually read it, the poem seemed to revive ideas about appropriateness in poetic diction that one would have thought long dead.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 'obscene' book that became a bestseller\n\u2022 Why did Jane Austen's sister burn her letters?\n\u2022 40 of the most exciting books to read in 2025\n\"What was unexpected and possibly shocking about\u00a0V,\" Byrne tells the BBC, \"was less the dialogue that represented a young football supporter swearing \u2013 what a surprise \u2013 and more the use of iambic pentameter quatrains, at a time when closely patterned, regular verse was regarded as outmoded, an unfitting vehicle for modern concerns. The transplantation of Gray's elegy from a small country churchyard to a large urban cemetery, the use of ellipses, slang, ordinary speech and Northern pronunciation perhaps suggested that poetry wasn't a sleepy dusty backwater, or necessarily couched in prissy, posh Southern or elaborate language.\"\nThe poem was once again broadcast in its entirety on Radio 4 in 2013. Although the press anticipated controversy, there was actually little fuss. Perhaps listeners had become more used to four-letter words being used in all sorts of media. The racist epithets would have if anything, been considered even more offensive in 2013 than when the Channel 4 film was broadcast. The half-hour Radio 4 documentary that was aired before the reading of the poem that contextualised the swear words and slurs must have helped listeners understand their use in the work.\nBoth poet and poem are now an accepted part of the literary canon. The website of the Poetry Foundation, a well-respected US organisation set up to promote poetry, describes Harrison as \"Britain's leading poet-playwright\", and says that V remains his \"most famous poem\". But while V's power to shock may have been somewhat diminished, it has lost none of its ability to engage and move the reader.\nThe full text of Tony Harrison\u2019s V can be read on the London Review of Books website.

        "article_text": "The 70km Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nAs I cycled along the asphalt road, the rural Japanese landscape of rolling hills merged with the sea at low tide. Rifts of sunlight gleamed dimly on the water, minutes before dusk. The small, round body of a stone-carved Jizo Bosatsu \u2013 a custodian Buddhist deity \u2013 was seated on the rocky shore, guarding people from maritime accidents. It felt like a scene from Japanese folklore.\u00a0\nOn a month-long trip to Japan last November, I was actively looking to avoid the busy cities and experience a rural slice of the country instead. This was how I came across Shimanami Kaido, a 70km-long cycling route that links the main islands of Honshu and Shikoku, weaving through six smaller islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea, a vast body of water that spreads for 400km connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.\u00a0\nFor millennia, these small, mountainous islands were only accessible by boat until the Nishi Seto Expressway was constructed for road transport in 1999. The Shimanami Kaido cycle path runs parallel to the motorway, connecting Onomichi in Honshu Island to Imabari in Shikoku Island via some of the world's longest suspension bridges. Designated as Japan's first \"National Cycling Route\" in 2019, Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nCyclist Mei Nakamura says that the trail offers a perfect mix of rural Japan's relaxed charm with opportunities to enjoy great cuisine and fresh seafood. \"What makes the Shimanami Kaido special is that it's enjoyable for everyone,\" she explains, \"from experienced road cyclists like myself to people who usually ride city bikes.\" And the slow, peaceful rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea creates a calm and welcoming vibe. \"It's one of the things I love most about it.\"\nYet, it is more than just a cycling route that crisscrosses seaside villages. Yoshi Kubota, general manager of the boutique hotel Azumi Setoda in Ikuchijima Island\u00a0\u2013 a key stop along the way\u00a0\u2013 says that Shimanami Kaido can be a great model for addressing overtourism. Nearly 35 million tourists flocked to Japan in 2024, most of them visiting tourist sites in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. But as demand for cycle tourism grows globally, bike routes like Shimanami Kaido help bring visitors to other parts of Japan to experience a relaxing atmosphere, bucolic scenery and local culture.\n\"You can promote cycle tourism and encourage people to stay longer in smaller communities. It helps distribute visitors evenly while benefiting the local economy,\" Kubota says. \"When you interact with locals, you get the feeling of actually living there. And you experience the slow life on the islands.\"\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWhen I arrived at the small seaport city of Onomichi to begin my journey, I could see what Kubota was talking about. On a sunny autumn day it felt as if time had lost its meaning here. Families flocked to the harbourfront to enjoy matcha ice cream, lemonade bars lined the pedestrian alleys and narrow lanes cut through the hillside town past a series of Buddhist shrines known as the Temple Walk. As I climbed up to the famous Senkoji Temple, the cityscape unravelled before me. Cargo vessels were moored to the pier. Beyond them was a chain of jungle-studded islets, bound by the sea's vastness.\nAlthough experienced cyclists can finish the entire 70km length in a few hours, I decided to cycle a 50km stretch over a single day. I was \u2013 quite ambitiously \u2013 armed with my experience as a child cyclist who leisurely pottered behind my father during his weekend rides in Sri Lanka. Luckily for me \u2013 and other beginners \u2013 Shimanamai Kaido is safe and easy to navigate, with luggage delivery services, rest spots, vending machines and bicycle repair shops along the way. The entire bike path is clearly indicated by a blue line painted on the side of the road, and is mostly car-free and flat with gradual inclines near the bridges with dedicated cycle passageways. Several companies offer bike rentals (including e-bikes), and cyclists can rent and drop off their bikes along the way.\nAlthough a bridge connects Onomichi with the neighbouring Mukaishima Island, I opted for the short ferry ride between the two. When I rolled off the ferry in Mukaishima, I set off along the blue-lined pathway and rode past along the seafront, from where I could see the distant bridges of Shimanami Kaido as ferries drifted across the water. Before long, the next-door Iwashi Island came into view and I wheeled in along the circling road to my first crossing, the 770m-long Innoshima Bridge.\nOver the next few hours, I took several detours through Innoshima Island. Although fit cyclists can ride up to Mount Shirataki along a steep, twisty road, many find it easier to tackle on foot. The observation deck, surrounded by 700 stone Buddhas, looks over the expressway that snakes past the green thicket before it joins the Innoshima bridge. Forested islands and the Inland Sea stretch off into the distance. It's said that the temple here was built by the Murakami Suigun, a maritime clan who controlled the trade in these treacherous sea routes from the 13th to 16th Centuries, and the island's Suigun Museum showcases their artefacts.\nAs I rode through Innoshima, patches of citrus groves clung to the hilly vistas, and I stopped for daifuku (Japanese rice cake) \u2013 stuffed with sweet, sour and slightly bitter local hassaku oranges \u2013 at the Hassakuya confectionery. With mild weather throughout the year and fewer typhoons, the Setouchi region (as the area surrounding the Seto Inland Sea is called) produces most of Japan's lemons. In fact, the town of Setoda on Ikuchijima Island, almost at the midpoint of Shimanami Kaido, is regarded as the origin of lemon cultivation in Japan. It's still a key production area, evident in a series of shops, restaurants and cafes that line the 600m picturesque main drag selling everything citrus-made from lemon ramen to lemon beer, tarts, cakes, juice and gelato.\nAfter a long day, I decided to stay the night at a guesthouse. But first I headed to Setoda's Kosanji Temple. Built over a span of 30 years by the steel merchant Kosanji Kozo in memory of her mother, the temple's colourful pagoda replicates architectural styles from all over Japan and a dimly lit cave illustrates a Buddhist hell. It also houses an Italian white-marble garden called Miraishin no Oka (meaning \"eternal hope for the future\") with gleaming towers. A couple of blocks away, I soaked at the town's sento (public bath) where navy-blue mosaics cover the walls with murals of the sea.\nIn recent years, Setoda, like the surrounding islands, has seen a rise in accommodations, cafes and restaurants. When I spoke to Kubota later, she told me that Shimanami Kaido has helped revive the region where most locals have left for cities for better opportunities. With new businesses cropping up, she explained that some of the island's younger people are now returning home. As locals, too, frequent these establishments, it's now \"gradually transforming the town\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\n\u2022\u00a0How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022\u00a0The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\nThe next afternoon, I set off for another 9km with the plan of returning to Setoda for one more night. The palm-lined cycle path followed the coast, from where I could see, hear and feel the rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea. As I continued, other cyclists rode past and men gathered to fish. Ferries sailed. Grandmothers rode their bikes with groceries. At Setoda Sunset Beach, families came together for a weekend picnic, their laughter filling the air.\nI cycled past a few scattered settlements as the road ascended through lemon farms towards the impressive, 1,480m Tatara Bridge with its long, fan-like cables. After traversing my third bridge of the journey, I entered the island of Omoshima, where I watched local families setting up their tents on a camping ground as I munched on onigiri (rice balls) inside a small wooden hut next to a convenience store by the sea.\nHeading back, I reached Setoda just in time for sunset. The waterfront was brimming with people catching the last light of the day. As I settled in for homemade lemonade from a nearby cafe, I thought about how cycling here helped me see a different side of Japan filled with stunning nature and the slow, idyllic atmosphere of the islands. By then, the novice cyclist in me was already planning a return trip next autumn.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled Mukaishima Island.

        "article_text": "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.\nFigures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.\nExperts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.\nBut the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.\n\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"\nMost UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases. \nWith home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.\nHeat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.\nAbout half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support. \nOne of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.\nEd Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.\n\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.\nIn its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.\nMr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive. \n\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.\nHe also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.\n\nDespite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.\nBut Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.\n\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.\nMadeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.\n\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.\nThis explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.\nMs Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.\nIn a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills. \n\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.\nAdditional reporting by Justin Rowlatt.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "summary": "UK homes install subsidised heat pumps at record level1 day agoShareSaveEsme StallardClimate and science reporter, BBC NewsBecky DaleData journalist, BBC VerifyShareSaveAndrew Aitchison/Getty ImagesThe number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy. With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). \"What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government toldMost UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases. One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has signed orders significantly expanding the goods exempted from his new tariffs on Canada and Mexico that were imposed this week.\nIt is the second time in two days that Trump has rolled back his taxes on imports from America's two biggest trade partners, measures that have raised uncertainty for businesses and worried financial markets.\nOn Wednesday, he said he would temporarily spare carmakers from 25% import levies just a day after they came into effect.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum thanked Trump for the move, while Canada's finance minister said the country would in turn hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday morning he had had a \"colourful\" conversation about tariffs in a phone call with Trump.\nThe US president used profane language more than once during Wednesday's heated exchange, according to US and Canadian media reports. \nTrudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies was likely for the foreseeable future, despite some targeted relief.\n\"Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,\" he said.\nA first round of Canadian retaliation targeting C$30bn ($21bn, \u00a316bn) of US goods is already in effect.\nThe trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence. \nOn Thursday afternoon, the leading US stock indexes were all lower, with the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest American companies, ending down nearly 1.8%.\nIn signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market. \n\"Nothing to do with the market,\" Trump said. \"I'm not even looking at the market, because long term, the United States will be very strong with what's happening.\"\nThe carveout from the duties applies to goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) , which Trump signed during his first term. Items that currently come into the US under the pact's rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide.\nA White House official said about 50% of US imports from Mexico and 62% from Canada may still face tariffs. Those proportions could change as firms change their practices in response to the order.\nThe White House has also continued to promote its plans for other tariffs, promising action on 2 April, when officials have said they will unveil recommendations for tailored, \"reciprocal\" trade duties on countries around the world.\nTrump said he agreed to grant the exemptions until 2 April after a phone call with Sheinbaum and they were aimed at helping carmakers and parts suppliers. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.  \nSheinbaum said on Thursday that she had had an \"excellent and respectful\" call with Trump, adding that the two countries would work together to stem the flow of the opioid fentanyl from Mexico into the US and curb the trafficking of guns going the other way.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, said afterwards that \"a pause on some tariffs means nothing\". \nEarlier, as relief looked likely but before it was announced, he told CNN that the province still planned to go ahead with a 25% tariff on the electricity it provides to 1.5 million homes and businesses in New York, Michigan and Minnesota from Monday.\n\"Honestly, it really bothers me. We have to do this, but I don't want to do this,\" he said.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday dismissed retaliation as counter-productive for trade negotiations. \n\"If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, 'Oh we're going to do this', then tariffs are probably going to go up,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. \nGoods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and the economies of the three countries are deeply integrated after decades of free trade. \nTrump has argued introducing tariffs will protect American industry and boost manufacturing. However, many economists say tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US, while warning they could trigger severe economic downturns in Mexico and Canada. \nAbout $1bn in trade enters the US from Mexico and Canada each day that does not claim duty-free exemptions under USMCA, since it has historically enjoyed low or no tariffs, said Daniel Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide.\n\"Whether importers can or will start claiming USMCA remains to be seen, but it's a huge amount of money at stake,\" he said. \nIn the US, the economy is already starting to show the effects of the disruption from Trump's policies. \nImports spiked in January on the back of tariff fears, with America's trade deficit increasing 34% to more than $130bn (\u00a3100bn), the Commerce Department reported. \nGregory Brown, who leads BenLee, a company that makes big trailers, said he had had to adjust prices multiple times over the last five weeks as a result of Trump's policies, which have included an order, set to go into effect later this month, expanding tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nBut Mr Brown, who attended Mr Bessent's speech, said that for now, his customers are agreeing to pay the higher prices \u2013 a sign that the economy is holding up.\n\"It's a great growth economy,\" he said, noting that the economy had been strong under Biden too.  He said he saw Trump's decision to quickly offer relief from his new tariffs as a sign of a business-friendly president adjusting to the \"business reality\".\nOthers were more worried that the back-and-forth would cause economic damage.\n\"I think we're going to have a recession before whatever succeeds in the future,\" one investment manager said. \"You're going to get the bad before you get the good.\"",

        "article_text": "Men's Six Nations: Ireland v France\nVenue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Saturday, 8 March Kick-off: 14:15 GMT\nCoverage: Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, Radio Ulster & BBC Sounds; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1\nPeruse Ireland and France's line-ups for Saturday's potential Six Nations title decider and you'll find no shortage of instantly compelling head-to-head battles. \nCaelan Doris v Gregory Alldritt pits two of the world's best number eights against one another, Andrew Porter v Uini Atonio will be an engrossing scrum-time tussle, while powerhouse Irish centre Bundee Aki will meet his match in Yoram Moefana. \nBut naturally, most eyes are drawn to the battle of the scrum-halves. \nIn Antoine Dupont, France have a generational talent. A world player of the year in both the 15s and sevens codes, an Olympic gold medallist and a poster boy for his sport, Dupont has gleefully exhausted superlatives in recent years. \nHis otherworldly gifts even moved his Toulouse team-mates to refer to him as 'the Martian', Emmanuel Meafou revealed last year.\nDupont's worthy adversary on Saturday is Jamison Gibson-Park. 'Jamo' to his team-mates, he is Ireland's unflappable metronome and the frontrunner to wear nine for the British and Irish Lions in Australia this summer.\n\"Yeah, it will be interesting,\" said Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby.\n\"Two fabulous players at the peak of their game. There are a number of individual battles across the teams, but that one will be pretty special.\"\nThis will not be the first time Gibson-Park and Dupont have crossed paths, of course. They have twice met in the Champions Cup, including last year's final when Dupont's Toulouse beat Gibson-Park's Leinster in extra time.  \nThey have met three times in the Six Nations, although not since 2022 (Gibson-Park was injured in 2023 while Dupont skipped last year's championship). \nThis time, the stakes are suitably sky-high.\nSix Nations: Ireland v France preview, coverage & stats\nDupont plays down Henry visit before Ireland game\nWinning 50th cap 'an incredible honour' - Bealham\nThis video can not be played\nIs Dupont the 'best player to ever play the game'?\nThis is a hugely important game for 28-year-old Dupont and France. For a player regarded by some as the greatest of all time, a single Six Nations title - in 2022 - is an underwhelming return. \nHe does not lack emotional ammunition heading to Dublin. In 2023, not even his herculean try-saving tackle on Mack Hansen could stop Ireland's charge to the Grand Slam. \nLater that year, France's home World Cup campaign ended in the quarter-finals. With his Olympic debut on the horizon, Dupont sat out last year's Six Nations as Les Bleus again finished second to the Irish. He led Toulouse to the Champions Cup in May, but craves more silverware at Test level.\nConsidering his Top 14 commitments are likely to rule him out of facing the All Blacks in the summer, the next couple of weeks takes on even greater significance as he leads France's bid to shift the Six Nations balance of power back to Paris. \nReassuringly for France head coach Fabien Galthie, Dupont has shone since his sevens sojourn. \nIn his first game back for Toulouse, in October, he scored a 13-minute hat-trick against Clermont. On his Test return, he captained his country to an unbeaten autumn campaign, which included a 30-29 win over New Zealand. \nFresh from scoring four tries in as many Champions Cup pool games for Toulouse, he sparkled on his Six Nations return.\nDupont's assist for Theo Attissogbe's try launched a 43-0 rout over Wales, his dead-eyed cross-kick encapsulating the decision-making and accuracy that helps set him apart.\nHe did, however, endure a rare off-night in the defeat by England. He was well shackled by the home side's defence and was not immune to the handling errors that derailed the French cause, dropping a Thomas Ramos pass when an opening try seemed a certainty.\nBut as the greats often do, he bounced back, masterfully orchestrating a French attack that scored 11 tries against Italy in Rome. \nHe even bagged himself a couple, his first Six Nations tries since the Grand Slam-clinching win over England in 2022. \nFrance missed Dupont last year, but he has been at the centre of this year's title bid, his eight direct try involvements (two tries, six assists) bettered only by his team-mate Louis Bielle-Biarrey (four tries, five assists). \nSignificantly, Romain Ntamack returns from suspension to partner Toulouse team-mate Dupont at half-back in Dublin. They started all five games of France's 2022 Grand Slam triumph together, but only one since the 2023 World Cup because of Ntamack's injuries and Dupont's sevens commitments.\nWhile Dupont is a global superstar, Gibson-Park prefers to stay away from the spotlight. Unfortunately for him, he is too good to remain in the background.  \nIt hasn't always been this way.\nAfter giving up on representing New Zealand, Gibson-Park moved to Leinster from the Hurricanes in 2016. He qualified for Ireland under the residency rule in 2019 but was left out of Joe Schmidt's World Cup squad. \nHe had to bide his time at Leinster, too, behind Luke McGrath, who started the 2018 and 2019 Champions Cup finals.\nIreland coach Andy Farrell, however, recognised his potential, handing him his Test debut in October 2020. \nHe shone in the autumn wins over Japan and New Zealand a year later, broke up Ireland's iconic Johnny Sexton-Conor Murray partnership and has not looked back, rarely being overlooked when fit.\nThis video can not be played\nZidane, pranks and surfing on a trophy - life as rugby's GOAT\nHaving missed last summer's Test series in South Africa through injury, Gibson-Park has elevated his game. In November's defeat by New Zealand, he was one of a select few in green who showed up, and was key in the victories over Argentina and Australia.\nHe has been even better in the Six Nations, delivering a series of game-changing moments for Ireland in recent weeks. \nIn his player-of-the-match display against England, he scored a crucial try to jolt Ireland out of a sluggish start, brilliantly side-stepping Freddie Steward after James Lowe had shrugged off Alex Mitchell. \nHe was arguably even better as Ireland powered past Scotland in Murrayfield. \nHis superb, try-saving tackle on Blair Kinghorn - after sprinting more than half the length of the field - demonstrated his defensive awareness, speed and ability to read the play as he stopped the hosts cutting Ireland's lead to two points.\nIn Cardiff - where he again won player of the match - he showed how his kicking helps Ireland open teams up. With Ireland trailing Wales 18-13 in the second half, it was his pinpoint cross-kick that allowed Lowe to palm the ball into Jamie Osborne's path for a crucial try.\nAlongside Lowe and Sam Prendergast, Gibson-Park has been at the forefront of Ireland's ramped-up kicking game this year. He recently said he \"couldn't kick snow off a rope\" when he arrived at Leinster in 2016, so he has turned weakness into strength.\nDupont came out on top when he last faced Gibson-Park in the 2024 Investec Champions Cup final \nGibson-Park is softly spoken in front of the media but his leadership should not be overlooked, either. \nAfter Sexton's retirement, he has helped guide untested fly-halves Jack Crowley and Prendergast through their debut Six Nations campaigns.  \nTo win in Dublin and take control of the championship, both sides need every facet operating with optimum efficiency. \nBut much will hinge on how the nines fare. Considering what they have produced in recent weeks, they are poised to take centre stage on Saturday. \nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders",

        "article_text": "The 70km Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nAs I cycled along the asphalt road, the rural Japanese landscape of rolling hills merged with the sea at low tide. Rifts of sunlight gleamed dimly on the water, minutes before dusk. The small, round body of a stone-carved Jizo Bosatsu \u2013 a custodian Buddhist deity \u2013 was seated on the rocky shore, guarding people from maritime accidents. It felt like a scene from Japanese folklore.\u00a0\nOn a month-long trip to Japan last November, I was actively looking to avoid the busy cities and experience a rural slice of the country instead. This was how I came across Shimanami Kaido, a 70km-long cycling route that links the main islands of Honshu and Shikoku, weaving through six smaller islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea, a vast body of water that spreads for 400km connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.\u00a0\nFor millennia, these small, mountainous islands were only accessible by boat until the Nishi Seto Expressway was constructed for road transport in 1999. The Shimanami Kaido cycle path runs parallel to the motorway, connecting Onomichi in Honshu Island to Imabari in Shikoku Island via some of the world's longest suspension bridges. Designated as Japan's first \"National Cycling Route\" in 2019, Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nCyclist Mei Nakamura says that the trail offers a perfect mix of rural Japan's relaxed charm with opportunities to enjoy great cuisine and fresh seafood. \"What makes the Shimanami Kaido special is that it's enjoyable for everyone,\" she explains, \"from experienced road cyclists like myself to people who usually ride city bikes.\" And the slow, peaceful rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea creates a calm and welcoming vibe. \"It's one of the things I love most about it.\"\nYet, it is more than just a cycling route that crisscrosses seaside villages. Yoshi Kubota, general manager of the boutique hotel Azumi Setoda in Ikuchijima Island\u00a0\u2013 a key stop along the way\u00a0\u2013 says that Shimanami Kaido can be a great model for addressing overtourism. Nearly 35 million tourists flocked to Japan in 2024, most of them visiting tourist sites in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. But as demand for cycle tourism grows globally, bike routes like Shimanami Kaido help bring visitors to other parts of Japan to experience a relaxing atmosphere, bucolic scenery and local culture.\n\"You can promote cycle tourism and encourage people to stay longer in smaller communities. It helps distribute visitors evenly while benefiting the local economy,\" Kubota says. \"When you interact with locals, you get the feeling of actually living there. And you experience the slow life on the islands.\"\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWhen I arrived at the small seaport city of Onomichi to begin my journey, I could see what Kubota was talking about. On a sunny autumn day it felt as if time had lost its meaning here. Families flocked to the harbourfront to enjoy matcha ice cream, lemonade bars lined the pedestrian alleys and narrow lanes cut through the hillside town past a series of Buddhist shrines known as the Temple Walk. As I climbed up to the famous Senkoji Temple, the cityscape unravelled before me. Cargo vessels were moored to the pier. Beyond them was a chain of jungle-studded islets, bound by the sea's vastness.\nAlthough experienced cyclists can finish the entire 70km length in a few hours, I decided to cycle a 50km stretch over a single day. I was \u2013 quite ambitiously \u2013 armed with my experience as a child cyclist who leisurely pottered behind my father during his weekend rides in Sri Lanka. Luckily for me \u2013 and other beginners \u2013 Shimanamai Kaido is safe and easy to navigate, with luggage delivery services, rest spots, vending machines and bicycle repair shops along the way. The entire bike path is clearly indicated by a blue line painted on the side of the road, and is mostly car-free and flat with gradual inclines near the bridges with dedicated cycle passageways. Several companies offer bike rentals (including e-bikes), and cyclists can rent and drop off their bikes along the way.\nAlthough a bridge connects Onomichi with the neighbouring Mukaishima Island, I opted for the short ferry ride between the two. When I rolled off the ferry in Mukaishima, I set off along the blue-lined pathway and rode past along the seafront, from where I could see the distant bridges of Shimanami Kaido as ferries drifted across the water. Before long, the next-door Iwashi Island came into view and I wheeled in along the circling road to my first crossing, the 770m-long Innoshima Bridge.\nOver the next few hours, I took several detours through Innoshima Island. Although fit cyclists can ride up to Mount Shirataki along a steep, twisty road, many find it easier to tackle on foot. The observation deck, surrounded by 700 stone Buddhas, looks over the expressway that snakes past the green thicket before it joins the Innoshima bridge. Forested islands and the Inland Sea stretch off into the distance. It's said that the temple here was built by the Murakami Suigun, a maritime clan who controlled the trade in these treacherous sea routes from the 13th to 16th Centuries, and the island's Suigun Museum showcases their artefacts.\nAs I rode through Innoshima, patches of citrus groves clung to the hilly vistas, and I stopped for daifuku (Japanese rice cake) \u2013 stuffed with sweet, sour and slightly bitter local hassaku oranges \u2013 at the Hassakuya confectionery. With mild weather throughout the year and fewer typhoons, the Setouchi region (as the area surrounding the Seto Inland Sea is called) produces most of Japan's lemons. In fact, the town of Setoda on Ikuchijima Island, almost at the midpoint of Shimanami Kaido, is regarded as the origin of lemon cultivation in Japan. It's still a key production area, evident in a series of shops, restaurants and cafes that line the 600m picturesque main drag selling everything citrus-made from lemon ramen to lemon beer, tarts, cakes, juice and gelato.\nAfter a long day, I decided to stay the night at a guesthouse. But first I headed to Setoda's Kosanji Temple. Built over a span of 30 years by the steel merchant Kosanji Kozo in memory of her mother, the temple's colourful pagoda replicates architectural styles from all over Japan and a dimly lit cave illustrates a Buddhist hell. It also houses an Italian white-marble garden called Miraishin no Oka (meaning \"eternal hope for the future\") with gleaming towers. A couple of blocks away, I soaked at the town's sento (public bath) where navy-blue mosaics cover the walls with murals of the sea.\nIn recent years, Setoda, like the surrounding islands, has seen a rise in accommodations, cafes and restaurants. When I spoke to Kubota later, she told me that Shimanami Kaido has helped revive the region where most locals have left for cities for better opportunities. With new businesses cropping up, she explained that some of the island's younger people are now returning home. As locals, too, frequent these establishments, it's now \"gradually transforming the town\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\n\u2022\u00a0How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022\u00a0The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\nThe next afternoon, I set off for another 9km with the plan of returning to Setoda for one more night. The palm-lined cycle path followed the coast, from where I could see, hear and feel the rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea. As I continued, other cyclists rode past and men gathered to fish. Ferries sailed. Grandmothers rode their bikes with groceries. At Setoda Sunset Beach, families came together for a weekend picnic, their laughter filling the air.\nI cycled past a few scattered settlements as the road ascended through lemon farms towards the impressive, 1,480m Tatara Bridge with its long, fan-like cables. After traversing my third bridge of the journey, I entered the island of Omoshima, where I watched local families setting up their tents on a camping ground as I munched on onigiri (rice balls) inside a small wooden hut next to a convenience store by the sea.\nHeading back, I reached Setoda just in time for sunset. The waterfront was brimming with people catching the last light of the day. As I settled in for homemade lemonade from a nearby cafe, I thought about how cycling here helped me see a different side of Japan filled with stunning nature and the slow, idyllic atmosphere of the islands. By then, the novice cyclist in me was already planning a return trip next autumn.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled Mukaishima Island.

        "article_text": "Forty years ago, Northern English poet Harrison published a powerful work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds. Then, when it was screened on TV in 1987, a national furore erupted.\n\"FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY\" thundered the front page of one British newspaper, condemning the \"cascade of expletives\". \"FROM BAD TO VERSE\" was the headline of another article, that quoted a Conservative Member of Parliament questioning whether the said poem \"serves any artistic purpose whatsoever\". And a group of particularly exercised MPs called for a debate in the House of Commons.\nThe furore was about a poem called V by northern English poet Tony Harrison \u2013 a work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds \u2013 which was originally published in January 1985, but really became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre when it was screened on national television in the UK two years later, in November 1987.\nIt is not often a poem becomes a hot topic of conversation among the general public. The last time it happened was four years ago when Amanda Gorman read her poem The Hill We Climb at Joe Biden's presidential inauguration, although the poet's youth and outfit excited as much comment as her verse. Before that, it was WH Auden's Funeral Blues, after it featured in the hit 1994 romcom Four Weddings and a Funeral.\u00a0\nBut if it is unusual for a poem to escape the confines of the world of literature, it's virtually unheard of for one to provoke angry newspaper headlines, and prompt politicians to demand action and members of the public to furiously call TV channels.\u00a0\nV had its origins in a visit by Harrison to Holbeck Cemetery in Beeston, Leeds, in May 1984. The cemetery stands on a hill \u2013 beneath which there are worked-out mine seams \u2013 and overlooks both Elland Road, home of Leeds United Football Club, and the University of Leeds, where Harrison, a poet and playwright, had studied Classics and Linguistics. Harrison, there to tend his parents' graves, found the cemetery strewn with beer cans and gravestones defaced by spray-painted graffiti \u2013 four-letter words, racist abuse, swastikas and a series of \"V\" letters. The nature of some of the graffiti suggested football fans were responsible.\nAt this time, unemployment was soaring, and went on to reach 11.9% later that year, a level not seen in the UK since 1971 \u2013 and not seen since. The previous year, an award-winning BBC drama, The Boys from the Blackstuff, about unemployed tarmac-layers in Liverpool, had captured the zeitgeist and made a huge impact. The Miners' Strike had started some weeks earlier. In fact, the country was deeply divided under a polarising Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher. In the vandalism and the spray-painted daubings, Harrison saw further evidence of societal division, and it gave him the idea for his poem.\nHarrison was, at this point, an established and well-respected poet, playwright and translator. He had published several volumes of verse and been the resident dramatist at the National Theatre, while his 1973 translation of Moli\u00e8re's The Misanthrope had won great acclaim.\nOn 24 January 1985, V was published in the London Review of Books.\nIt consists of 112 four-line stanzas, or quatrains, with an ABAB rhyming scheme, the same form as Thomas Gray's celebrated 18th-Century poem Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, which Harrison sought to evoke in contrast with his own work.\nThe \"V\" of the title stands for \"versus\" \u2013 which is also a pun on \"verses\" \u2013 but maybe also for \"victory\", and perhaps it is further intended to refer to the two-fingered \"V sign\" gesture considered rude in British culture.\nOne verse reads:\nThese Vs are all the versuses of life\nfrom LEEDS v. DERBY, Black/White\nand (as I've known to my cost) man v. wife, \nCommunist v. Fascist, Left v. Right.\nThe poem imagines the poet engaging in a dialogue with the person who has defaced the graves, and it features the obscenities and racist epithets used in the graffiti.\n\"We didn't need Harrison to tell us then that Britain was divided, and we don't now, but\u00a0V was a powerful articulation of those divisions and some of their causes,\" says Sandie Byrne, Professor of English at the University of Oxford.\u00a0\n\"The football supporter who, taking a shortcut through the cemetery, takes out his rage on the gravestones, is treated sympathetically, albeit with aggressive language to match his own. The Harrison figure understands the frustration of the third-generation unemployed among headstones celebrating lifelong professions.\n\"The poem's power and endurance come from its energy, the impetus of the verse and the language, its anger, and its use of the personal in the service of the political.\"\nV did not appear to cause any outrage when first printed in the London Review of Books. It was subsequently published in book form by Bloodaxe Books in November 1985 and, again, troubled neither the UK's legislature nor its newspapers.\u00a0Neil\u00a0Astley, founder of Bloodaxe Books, and still the publisher's editor and managing director, recalls that, soon after the publication of the poem as a book, \u00a0Harrison performed the entire thing in a late-night arts slot on Tyne Tees Television, which catered specifically to audiences in North East England, and \"it went out without arousing any opposition as far as I'm aware\".\nBut then in 1987, it became known that a televised version of the poem had been made for national broadcaster Channel 4, directed by celebrated theatre director Richard Eyre and featuring Harrison reading the poem along with footage of, among other things, striking miners, Holbeck Cemetery and Thatcher doing a \"victory\" sign. At that point, all hell broke loose.\nIn October, a few weeks before its broadcast, the Daily Mail reported on the \"FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY\" on its front page. The activist and anti-obscenity campaigner Mary Whitehouse called the poem a \"work of singular nastiness\". Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth, who earlier that year had attempted to introduce legislation that would make it a crime to air material that might cause \"gross offence\" to a \"reasonable person\", was another who opposed its broadcast. He officially called for a debate in the House of Commons to try to stop it. One hundred and twenty one MPs signed the proposal. Howarth later admitted he had not read the poem in full. Harrison recalled in the 2013 BBC Radio 4 documentary, Exploring V, that at the height of the furore, a reporter from the Telegraph knocked on his door. \"I said, 'Have you read the poem?'\u2019 He said,'No. I'm New'.\"\nOpposition to the TV programme came principally from right wing commentators but the Sunday Telegraph columnist and editor of the Literary Review, Auberon Waugh, whom no-one had ever mistaken for a left winger, found the poem \"well written and extremely moving\", as he wrote in his Telegraph column at the time. Ian Hislop, the editor of UK satirical magazine Private Eye, wrote an article defending it in The Listener, as did Bernard Levin in the Times, calling it \"powerful, profound and haunting\". And the Independent printed the whole poem in its news pages, with an introduction by Blake Morrison in which he wrote: \"Those MPs are right to believe that the poem is shocking but not because of its language. It shocks because it describes unflinchingly what is meant by a divided society, because it takes the abstractions we have learned to live with \u2013 unemployment, racial tension, inequality, deprivation \u2013\u00a0and gives them a kind of physical existence on the page.\"\nThe film was broadcast at 11pm on Channel 4 on Wednesday 4 November 1987. According to the logs of the Channel 4 staff on the switchboard \u2013 which were reproduced in the appendix of Bloodaxe's second edition of the poem, along with many of the newspaper and magazine articles about the furore \u2013 there were several calls from viewers irate at the \"disgusting language\". But others approved. Mr K of Watford suggested \"politicians should address their energies into the social problems featured in the poem\". Mr W of London said: \"I am so moved the tears are running down my cheeks\". The majority of calls were in favour of the broadcast.\n\"The irony is, of course, that while Bloodaxe had sold a couple of thousand copies of the poem before 1987, as a result of the attacks on the Channel 4 film, V reached an audience of millions who might otherwise never have heard of it,\" Astley tells the BBC. \"And if you read the poem today, it feels every bit as vital and relevant as it was 40 years ago.\"\nSandie Byrne says: \"I remember friends reading about the poem in the press, and assuming that it was just a meretricious piece studded with swear words by a shock jock seeking attention. Others picked up that it mentioned [miners' leader] Arthur Scargill, and showed scenes of the miners' strike, and assumed that those were its only subjects. Even among those who actually read it, the poem seemed to revive ideas about appropriateness in poetic diction that one would have thought long dead.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 'obscene' book that became a bestseller\n\u2022 Why did Jane Austen's sister burn her letters?\n\u2022 40 of the most exciting books to read in 2025\n\"What was unexpected and possibly shocking about\u00a0V,\" Byrne tells the BBC, \"was less the dialogue that represented a young football supporter swearing \u2013 what a surprise \u2013 and more the use of iambic pentameter quatrains, at a time when closely patterned, regular verse was regarded as outmoded, an unfitting vehicle for modern concerns. The transplantation of Gray's elegy from a small country churchyard to a large urban cemetery, the use of ellipses, slang, ordinary speech and Northern pronunciation perhaps suggested that poetry wasn't a sleepy dusty backwater, or necessarily couched in prissy, posh Southern or elaborate language.\"\nThe poem was once again broadcast in its entirety on Radio 4 in 2013. Although the press anticipated controversy, there was actually little fuss. Perhaps listeners had become more used to four-letter words being used in all sorts of media. The racist epithets would have if anything, been considered even more offensive in 2013 than when the Channel 4 film was broadcast. The half-hour Radio 4 documentary that was aired before the reading of the poem that contextualised the swear words and slurs must have helped listeners understand their use in the work.\nBoth poet and poem are now an accepted part of the literary canon. The website of the Poetry Foundation, a well-respected US organisation set up to promote poetry, describes Harrison as \"Britain's leading poet-playwright\", and says that V remains his \"most famous poem\". But while V's power to shock may have been somewhat diminished, it has lost none of its ability to engage and move the reader.\nThe full text of Tony Harrison\u2019s V can be read on the London Review of Books website.

        "summary": "\"I said, 'Have you read the poem? And a group of particularly exercised MPs called for a debate in the House of Commons.The furore was about a poem called V by northern English poet Tony Harrison \u2013 a work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds \u2013 which was originally published in January 1985, but really became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre when it was screened on national television in the UK two years later, in November 1987.Getty ImagesTony Harrison has long been one of Britain's most respected contemporary poets (Credit: Getty Images)It is not often a poem becomes a hot topic of conversation among the general public. Neil\u00a0Astley, founder of Bloodaxe Books, and still the publisher's editor and managing director, recalls that, soon after the publication of the poem as a book, \u00a0Harrison performed the entire thing in a late-night arts slot on Tyne Tees Television, which catered specifically to audiences in North East England, and \"it went out without arousing any opposition as far as I'm aware\".The moment of impact\u00a0\u00a0But then in 1987, it became known that a televised version of the poem had been made for national broadcaster Channel 4, directed by celebrated theatre director Richard Eyre and featuring Harrison reading the poem along with footage of, among other things, striking miners, Holbeck Cemetery and Thatcher doing a \"victory\" sign. The majority of calls were in favour of the broadcast.Getty ImagesAnti-obscenity campaigner Mary Whitehouse was among the poem's most high-profile critics (Credit: Getty Images)\"The irony is, of course, that while Bloodaxe had sold a couple of thousand copies of the poem before 1987, as a result of the attacks on the Channel 4 film, V reached an audience of millions who might otherwise never have heard of it,\" Astley tells the BBC. He had published several volumes of verse and been the resident dramatist at the National Theatre, while his 1973 translation of Moli\u00e8re's The Misanthrope had won great acclaim.On 24 January 1985, V was published in the London Review of Books.It consists of 112 four-line stanzas, or quatrains, with an ABAB rhyming scheme, the same form as Thomas Gray's celebrated 18th-Century poem Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, which Harrison sought to evoke in contrast with his own work.The \"V\" of the title stands for \"versus\" \u2013 which is also a pun on \"verses\" \u2013 but maybe also for \"victory\", and perhaps it is further intended to refer to the two-fingered \"V sign\" gesture considered rude in British culture.One verse reads:These Vs are all the versuses of lifefrom LEEDS v. DERBY, Black/Whiteand (as I've known to my cost) man v. wife, Communist v. Fascist, Left v. Right.The poem imagines the poet engaging in a dialogue with the person who has defaced the graves, and it features the obscenities and racist epithets used in the graffiti.",

        "article_text": "The cake is a sublime art form, involving numerous colours and flavours commingling into an oh-so-soft and delicious cake that hides a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\nThe rich, buttery aroma of kek lapis (layer cake) greets me when I walk into Seri's (short for Sharifah Zainon) small baking studio at her home near Kuala Lumpur. The alluring aroma is not surprising, given that Malaysia is gearing up to celebrate Raya, which is short for Hari Raya (the Day of Celebration in Malay), and refers to the festive occasion marking the end of Ramadan. Kek lapis is an integral part of these festivities.\nSeri puts her academic training as an engineer to good use in her current career as a baker. Watching her hands spreading the batter evenly on the pan, I think that baking a kek lapis is a bit like conducting a scientific experiment. Preparing this multi-layered Malaysian cake with colourful and complex patterns not only requires knowledge and skill, but also oodles of patience, an eye for precision and a steady hand.\nA degree in the sciences seems to come in handy for kek lapis bakers, seeing the elaborate designs that Karen Chai, another engineer turned baker, creates at her baking studio in a quiet Kuala Lumpur suburb. When Chai returned to Malaysia after studying pastry arts at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, she decided to focus on kek lapis, using her mother's recipe as a starting point. \"Learning about the science of baking has been very useful in making kek lapis,\" she said.\nThis layer cake first came to Malaysia from neighbouring Indonesia through the state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo. In the mid-19th Century, Dutch colonisers introduced the plain European spit cake \u2013 made with layers of dough deposited one by one onto a cylindrical rotating spit \u2013 to the nation then known as Batavia (now Jakarta). Indonesians added local spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg and turned it into the lapis legit, often known as the thousand-layer cake.\nUpon its arrival in neighbouring Malaysia in the 1970s, Sarawakians elevated the cake to a sublime art form, involving multiple layers and numerous colours and flavours commingling into the oh-so-soft and delicious kek lapis. While the classic kek lapis often looks like a plain loaf on the outside, cutting it reveals a kaleidoscope of intricate geometric patterns.\nAlso called the Sarawak layer cake, kek lapis typically has a minimum of 12 layers. The cake is created by carefully adding one thin layer of batter after another onto a baking pan every few minutes, broiling (or grilling) each layer in the oven to ensure the lower layers are never burnt. The plain version alternates light and dark strips of cake batter, whereas the coloured cakes have geometric patterns that, depending on the final pattern, can involve 20 or more layers.\nThe final cake is cooled and then cut into strips, with different pieces reassembled using thick jam or condensed milk as adhesive. Often, multiple cakes have to be baked, and pieces from each of them are assembled to create a complex pattern. This is then wrapped up in a thin cake layer of a single colour, or arranged between two sets of plain (ie, with no colours or patterns) multi-layered cakes.\nIf all this sounds confusing, then imagine what it is like for the baker. Even the most experienced of them first draws these patterns on paper, clearly marking out sizes and colours, after which they get to work with the batter. A complex design can take up to eight hours to complete, with several chances for error at every step in the assembly process.\nChai explains that as opposed to other complex layered cakes, it is particularly tough with kek lapis, since the error often becomes apparent only after the baker has finished assembling the pieces, \"so all the hard work goes down the drain\".\nShe then shows me photos of her mother's signature 16-piece design that was born out of an error in calculation. \"She baked a few extra layers by mistake and didn't want to throw those pieces away. She just cut that up and tried to form another block, and this design came out. So this is not something that you will find from other bakers,\" she said.\nBoth Seri and Chai say that the long and laborious baking process is worth the reward of seeing a perfectly executed design. \"But there are no short cuts,\" Chai warned. Indeed, seeing Seri at work, cutting and sticking these long strips together with a generous lashing of raspberry jam, brings to mind a complicated jigsaw puzzle slowly taking shape. \"It's like therapy, [but] it's also fun and creative\" she said.\nWhen I visited in mid-February, the bakers had been working non-stop for weeks, fulfilling Raya orders received through their social media channels. Back in their hometowns in Sarawak, kek lapis is part of every holiday celebration, including Chinese New Year, Raya, Christmas and the midyear harvest festival of Gawai Dayak, cutting across communal and religious boundaries.\nSeri's long-term client and self-professed cake lover, Farazaila Wahet, said, \"This is an anytime cake for me, but of course for Raya, it is a must.\" The Sarawak native, who moved to Kuala Lumpur more than 10 years ago, said that the satisfaction she gets from kek lapis is unparalleled, because \"the texture is heavier and the taste is richer compared to any other cake.\"\nKek lapis is available in many flavours, such as chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, red velvet and pandan (a tropical plant with a strong aroma, commonly used in Southeast Asian cooking). Even popular malted drinks like Horlicks and Milo are used for flavouring. And now, artisanal bakers like Seri and Chai are trying to modernise this traditional cake to make it relevant to younger generations, while also staying true to the original recipe.\nSeri, for instance, makes exquisite chocolate batik art on the top layer to make her cakes even more attractive. \"Batik is traditional to Malaysia, so is kek lapis, and I love to combine the two to create this new version,\" she said.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A multi-layered cake from India\n\u2022\u00a0Norway's best cake\n\u2022\u00a0The centuries-old baba made with 96 egg yolks\nChai keeps experimenting not just with more complicated patterns, but also new ingredients and flavour pairings. In the past, she has created gluten-free kek lapis using coconut flour with peanut butter topping, and another unique version with fig, apricot and cinnamon.\nBaking a good kek lapis requires a lot of time and high-quality ingredients, which means that they are also expensive, with prices going up to RM300 (roughly \u00a350) or more for a square, one-kilogram cake. But thankfully for the small-batch bakers, this traditional cake is constantly in demand from individual clients and it's also gaining in popularity as corporate gifts and wedding favours.\nThese bakers are on a mission to maintain this Sarawak culinary tradition, despite all the long hours and thin margins. As Seri said, \"Every time I make a kek lapis, it feels like a piece of home to me.\"\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\n---\u00a0\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.",

        "article_text": "Max Verstappen is aiming to become only the second driver to win five successive drivers' championships in 2025\nRed Bull might have won the world drivers' title for the fourth year in a row with Max Verstappen last year, but they head into the new season under conspicuous pressure.\nThey have lost their design guru, following Adrian Newey's move to Aston Martin, rivals are circling around Verstappen, and over the second half of last year, Red Bull had only the third fastest car in Formula 1.\nSo what is at stake for Red Bull as they head into the final year of F1's current regulations?\nVerstappen's fourth title was founded on the points advantage he built in a brief period of dominance at the start of the year, and an outstanding performance from the Dutchman for the remainder of the season.\nFrom the sixth race of the season in Miami, the car no longer retained the massive advantage over the rest of the field it had enjoyed in the first five races, or the two preceding years.\nYes, it ended the year as on average the fastest car in qualifying - by 0.052 seconds over the McLaren. But take the numbers from Miami onwards and the McLaren was faster by 0.053secs. Over the second half the season, the McLaren was faster by 0.142secs and Red Bull were also slower than Ferrari - by 0.008secs.\nHad McLaren started the season in a stronger position, therefore, Verstappen's championship would have been a lot harder to win.\nRed Bull's issue was that a fundamental balance disconnect became more apparent as they tried to add performance to their car. They struggled to solve their mid-corner, slow-speed understeer without creating oversteer in the fast corners.\nNewey said: \"Already through the very last stages of '23, the car was starting to become more difficult to drive,\" Newey said. \"Max could handle it. Checo (Sergio Perez) couldn't.\n\"That carried into the first part of '24, but the car was still quick enough to be able to cope with it.\n\"It's something I was starting to become concerned about, but not many other people in the organisation seemed to be very concerned about it.\n\"And from what I can see from the outside, but I don't know\u2026 the guys at Red Bull, this is no criticism, but I think they just \u2013 perhaps through lack of experience \u2013 kept going in that same (development) direction. And the problem became more and more acute, to the point that even Max found it difficult to drive.\"\nRed Bull believe they lost ground because they did not exploit aero-elasticity of front wings as much as McLaren, Mercedes and later Ferrari.\nThis method of construction enables teams to build the carbon-fibre in their front-wing in such a way as to have the elements flex downwards at high speed, reducing downforce and therefore oversteer, but have them move back into optimum downforce mode at slower speeds.\nNew rules for this season limit the flexibility of wings - at the rear from the first race, and at the front from the Spanish Grand Prix in June.\nThe question is whether this was the sole issue Red Bull faced, and whether they can catch up the ground McLaren and Ferrari made last year, and whatever development progress their rivals have made over the winter.\nNewey's departure came in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment and coercive, controlling behaviour made against team principal Christian Horner by a female employee.\nHorner has always denied the allegations and was cleared by two separate Red Bull internal investigations. But they unsettled Newey, and added to the disquiet Red Bull's design chief was already feeling about internal politics within the engineering team.\nThere was a disagreement as to who was primarily responsible for Red Bull's recent success. Newey felt technical director Pierre Wache was unfairly pushing for credit - and Horner backed him publicly. Whereas Newey saw the 2022 car and fundamental concept Red Bull followed for F1's current regulations as very much his.\nThe 2025 car will inevitably be an evolution of the 2024 design, given that this is the final year of a set of technical regulations and there is massive change coming for next year. Nevertheless, Newey's departure gives Wache and the rest of the design team a chance to prove themselves out of Newey's shadow.\nIt is a chance for Red Bull to prove a point, but it could go either way.\nRed Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko has already been quoted saying that he believed the team were slower to get on top of their problems in 2024 than they would have been had Newey still been involved.\nIf they cannot return to having the best car, then there will be a major spotlight on Red Bull and serious questions being asked.\nMax and Jos Verstappen with Red Bull team boss Christian Horner during pre-season testing in Bahrain last month\nThe pressure on Red Bull is all the greater because of the potential ramifications of this year on Verstappen's future.\nThe Dutchman, 27, is under contract to Red Bull until the end of 2028, but his deal has performance clauses in it - the details of which are not known publicly. That means that if Red Bull don't produce a competitive, winning car, Verstappen could leave.\nVerstappen's father Jos made it abundantly clear in 2024 that he was not happy about Horner remaining in charge, saying back at the first race of the season that the team risked breaking apart if Horner stayed on as boss.\nAs Newey's departure was followed by that of sporting director Jonathan Wheatley to Sauber/Audi, and head of strategy Will Courtenay's decision to leave for McLaren - although Courtenay is currently being held to his contract - it could be argued that Jos Verstappen has a point.\nRelations between Horner and Verstappen Sr remain tense, even if an uneasy truce has developed in recent months.\nMercedes team principal Toto Wolff has made no secret of the fact that he wants Verstappen in one of his cars as soon as he can get him.\nVerstappen could also have future options at Aston Martin, where Fernando Alonso's contract expires at the end of 2026, and Ferrari, where both Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc are said to reach potential break points in their deals at the same time.\nThe forthcoming 2026 regulations complicate things - the Verstappens may wish to wait and see how things pan out next year, given that both the chassis and engine rules are changing then.\nBut if Red Bull are not competitive this year, the temptation to jump early may be significant.\nHorner remains in situ, with the backing of Red Bull's main shareholder Chalerm Yoovidhya. The Austrian side of the team is said to be less supportive.\nThe allegations brought an internal power struggle at Red Bull out into the open, between the Thai and Austrian shareholders, and between Horner and Marko.\nMuch as with Horner and Jos Verstappen, there is currently a truce. Will it hold?\nAnd it remains to be seen whether the complainant will take matters further legally.\nAfter two seasons of Sergio Perez struggling alongside Verstappen, Red Bull finally lost patience with the Mexican at the end of last year and paid him off.\nThat decision was very expensive - it was made despite Horner deciding in the early summer last year to grant Perez a two-year contract extension to the end of 2026, when they could have signed Carlos Sainz instead.\nIn Perez's place, Red Bull have promoted New Zealander Liam Lawson.\nHorner acknowledges that being Verstappen's team-mate is probably the toughest job in F1, and Red Bull are asking Lawson to come in and do better than Perez after a career that has so far spanned only 11 grands prix for Red Bull's second team over two seasons.\nLiam Lawson drove five F1 races for Red Bull's second team in 2023 and six in 2024\nLawson put in some creditable and combative performances on his return last year, following Red Bull's decision to drop Daniel Ricciardo from their Racing Bulls team. But on average he was slightly slower than team-mate Yuki Tsunoda in qualifying.\nThere is no doubt that Perez's failings last year cost the team dearly in the constructors' championship.\nHe finished last out of all the drivers from the top four teams, and failed to score a podium finish after the fifth race of the season in China. That was a major factor in Red Bull slumping to third in the teams' title chase behind McLaren and Ferrari.\nBut Perez's average qualifying deficit to Verstappen was just over 0.4secs, which is better than Alex Albon managed in 2020 and Pierre Gasly in 2019 before each was dropped. And Albon and Gasly have gone on to produce impressive performances for their new teams, Williams and Alpine.\nLawson will be under pressure to prove he is a step up from Perez, or the decision-making process of Red Bull management will come back under scrutiny.\n'I know my time will come' - Russell exclusive\nNetflix series shows moment Horner learns of alleged messages\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

        "article_text": "Men's Six Nations: Ireland v France\nVenue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Saturday, 8 March Kick-off: 14:15 GMT\nCoverage: Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, Radio Ulster & BBC Sounds; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1\nPeruse Ireland and France's line-ups for Saturday's potential Six Nations title decider and you'll find no shortage of instantly compelling head-to-head battles. \nCaelan Doris v Gregory Alldritt pits two of the world's best number eights against one another, Andrew Porter v Uini Atonio will be an engrossing scrum-time tussle, while powerhouse Irish centre Bundee Aki will meet his match in Yoram Moefana. \nBut naturally, most eyes are drawn to the battle of the scrum-halves. \nIn Antoine Dupont, France have a generational talent. A world player of the year in both the 15s and sevens codes, an Olympic gold medallist and a poster boy for his sport, Dupont has gleefully exhausted superlatives in recent years. \nHis otherworldly gifts even moved his Toulouse team-mates to refer to him as 'the Martian', Emmanuel Meafou revealed last year.\nDupont's worthy adversary on Saturday is Jamison Gibson-Park. 'Jamo' to his team-mates, he is Ireland's unflappable metronome and the frontrunner to wear nine for the British and Irish Lions in Australia this summer.\n\"Yeah, it will be interesting,\" said Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby.\n\"Two fabulous players at the peak of their game. There are a number of individual battles across the teams, but that one will be pretty special.\"\nThis will not be the first time Gibson-Park and Dupont have crossed paths, of course. They have twice met in the Champions Cup, including last year's final when Dupont's Toulouse beat Gibson-Park's Leinster in extra time.  \nThey have met three times in the Six Nations, although not since 2022 (Gibson-Park was injured in 2023 while Dupont skipped last year's championship). \nThis time, the stakes are suitably sky-high.\nSix Nations: Ireland v France preview, coverage & stats\nDupont plays down Henry visit before Ireland game\nWinning 50th cap 'an incredible honour' - Bealham\nThis video can not be played\nIs Dupont the 'best player to ever play the game'?\nThis is a hugely important game for 28-year-old Dupont and France. For a player regarded by some as the greatest of all time, a single Six Nations title - in 2022 - is an underwhelming return. \nHe does not lack emotional ammunition heading to Dublin. In 2023, not even his herculean try-saving tackle on Mack Hansen could stop Ireland's charge to the Grand Slam. \nLater that year, France's home World Cup campaign ended in the quarter-finals. With his Olympic debut on the horizon, Dupont sat out last year's Six Nations as Les Bleus again finished second to the Irish. He led Toulouse to the Champions Cup in May, but craves more silverware at Test level.\nConsidering his Top 14 commitments are likely to rule him out of facing the All Blacks in the summer, the next couple of weeks takes on even greater significance as he leads France's bid to shift the Six Nations balance of power back to Paris. \nReassuringly for France head coach Fabien Galthie, Dupont has shone since his sevens sojourn. \nIn his first game back for Toulouse, in October, he scored a 13-minute hat-trick against Clermont. On his Test return, he captained his country to an unbeaten autumn campaign, which included a 30-29 win over New Zealand. \nFresh from scoring four tries in as many Champions Cup pool games for Toulouse, he sparkled on his Six Nations return.\nDupont's assist for Theo Attissogbe's try launched a 43-0 rout over Wales, his dead-eyed cross-kick encapsulating the decision-making and accuracy that helps set him apart.\nHe did, however, endure a rare off-night in the defeat by England. He was well shackled by the home side's defence and was not immune to the handling errors that derailed the French cause, dropping a Thomas Ramos pass when an opening try seemed a certainty.\nBut as the greats often do, he bounced back, masterfully orchestrating a French attack that scored 11 tries against Italy in Rome. \nHe even bagged himself a couple, his first Six Nations tries since the Grand Slam-clinching win over England in 2022. \nFrance missed Dupont last year, but he has been at the centre of this year's title bid, his eight direct try involvements (two tries, six assists) bettered only by his team-mate Louis Bielle-Biarrey (four tries, five assists). \nSignificantly, Romain Ntamack returns from suspension to partner Toulouse team-mate Dupont at half-back in Dublin. They started all five games of France's 2022 Grand Slam triumph together, but only one since the 2023 World Cup because of Ntamack's injuries and Dupont's sevens commitments.\nWhile Dupont is a global superstar, Gibson-Park prefers to stay away from the spotlight. Unfortunately for him, he is too good to remain in the background.  \nIt hasn't always been this way.\nAfter giving up on representing New Zealand, Gibson-Park moved to Leinster from the Hurricanes in 2016. He qualified for Ireland under the residency rule in 2019 but was left out of Joe Schmidt's World Cup squad. \nHe had to bide his time at Leinster, too, behind Luke McGrath, who started the 2018 and 2019 Champions Cup finals.\nIreland coach Andy Farrell, however, recognised his potential, handing him his Test debut in October 2020. \nHe shone in the autumn wins over Japan and New Zealand a year later, broke up Ireland's iconic Johnny Sexton-Conor Murray partnership and has not looked back, rarely being overlooked when fit.\nThis video can not be played\nZidane, pranks and surfing on a trophy - life as rugby's GOAT\nHaving missed last summer's Test series in South Africa through injury, Gibson-Park has elevated his game. In November's defeat by New Zealand, he was one of a select few in green who showed up, and was key in the victories over Argentina and Australia.\nHe has been even better in the Six Nations, delivering a series of game-changing moments for Ireland in recent weeks. \nIn his player-of-the-match display against England, he scored a crucial try to jolt Ireland out of a sluggish start, brilliantly side-stepping Freddie Steward after James Lowe had shrugged off Alex Mitchell. \nHe was arguably even better as Ireland powered past Scotland in Murrayfield. \nHis superb, try-saving tackle on Blair Kinghorn - after sprinting more than half the length of the field - demonstrated his defensive awareness, speed and ability to read the play as he stopped the hosts cutting Ireland's lead to two points.\nIn Cardiff - where he again won player of the match - he showed how his kicking helps Ireland open teams up. With Ireland trailing Wales 18-13 in the second half, it was his pinpoint cross-kick that allowed Lowe to palm the ball into Jamie Osborne's path for a crucial try.\nAlongside Lowe and Sam Prendergast, Gibson-Park has been at the forefront of Ireland's ramped-up kicking game this year. He recently said he \"couldn't kick snow off a rope\" when he arrived at Leinster in 2016, so he has turned weakness into strength.\nDupont came out on top when he last faced Gibson-Park in the 2024 Investec Champions Cup final \nGibson-Park is softly spoken in front of the media but his leadership should not be overlooked, either. \nAfter Sexton's retirement, he has helped guide untested fly-halves Jack Crowley and Prendergast through their debut Six Nations campaigns.  \nTo win in Dublin and take control of the championship, both sides need every facet operating with optimum efficiency. \nBut much will hinge on how the nines fare. Considering what they have produced in recent weeks, they are poised to take centre stage on Saturday. \nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Uncle Harry... he's the best supporter ever' - Lampard\nTaking over from the EFL's longest-serving boss was never going to be an easy task for Frank Lampard.\nMark Robins had spent seven years with Coventry City, won two promotions, nearly reached the Premier League and then almost guided them to an FA Cup final just six months before he was sacked on 7 November last year.\nThey were big shoes to fill.\n\"I like to prove people wrong,\" Lampard said following his appointment - a decision that was not universally backed by the Sky Blues fanbase at the time.\nThe former Chelsea, Everton and Derby County manager has already gone some way to doing just that following an impressive recent run of form.\nWhen Lampard took over three weeks after Robins left, Coventry were 17th in the Championship, 10 points from the play-off spots and only two points above the relegation zone.\nA little more than three months later and Coventry are now fifth, propelled by eight wins from their past nine, losing only against leaders Leeds United in that time.\nWith their next test the visit of Stoke City - and return of Robins to the CBS Arena for the first time since his departure - BBC Sport takes a look at Lampard's progress in the West Midlands so far.\nCoventry are leading a tight group of at least seven teams realistically fighting for the two final play-off spots\nLampard says he \"didn't envisage\" climbing the table so quickly to challenge for the play-offs but also isn't \"getting carried away with where we are now\".\n\"I felt that we could improve and work ourselves up the table but the reality was, we were looking behind as much as ahead for a few weeks when we first got in,\" Lampard told BBC Football Focus.\n\"It's not easy to bring confidence, it's not easy to find the things in the team we need to correct, to be more compact.\n\"These things have to take a bit of work and time, so I wasn't sure how quickly it would happen.\n\"We're not going to get automatic promotion, we know that gap is too big. But can we do everything in our power to close the gap? I thought we could, I just didn't think we would get in as quickly.\n\"So, the next challenge is to show consistency.\"\nCoventry last won eight games from nine in the 1969-70 season\nCoventry are on their best run in the league for 55 years in terms of sheer points accumulation over a nine-game period.\nTheir recent tally of eight wins in nine matches is their most since they did the same between November 1969 and February 1970, in what was then Division One (now the Premier League).\nThe Sky Blues strung together 14 games without defeat in 2020 (W11 D3) on the way to winning League One under Robins, also between January and March, but didn't exceed 24 points in any nine consecutive outings despite that streak.\nSimilarly, Lampard has never been on such a run during his managerial career, even when he took Derby to the Championship play-offs in 2018-19, nor with Chelsea the following campaign when the Blues finished fourth in the top flight.\nCoventry have scored more regularly and conceded less frequently under Lampard compared to Robins\nThe Lampard effect is clear to see, with Coventry improving on every metric in the Championship compared to Robins this season.\nThey have scored more goals per game under Lampard (1.50) than Robins (1.28) and also conceded fewer in each match (1.05 compared to 1.35).\n\"When you get in, you try and analyse the problems quickly and we were conceding too many goals,\" Lampard said.\n\"We weren't compact enough, we weren't aggressive enough, so we tried to really prioritise our off the ball work.\n\"The players have done it because they've bought into everything we've tried to say.\n\"I have to say, this group of players, the humility, the application of them is absolutely amazing.\"\nAmong the standout performers who have improved under Lampard are creative midfielder Jack Rudoni and winger Ephron Mason-Clark.\nNo other Coventry player has had more goal contributions than Rudoni since Lampard arrived, scoring three goals and providing six assists, while Mason-Clark has netted four times and laid on another four in that time.\nStriker Ellis Simms has also seen an upturn in performances, putting opposing defenders under more pressure than previously, and his output has increased, grabbing four goals and an assist, compared to just two goals under Robins.\nThat has perhaps stemmed from Simms having to fight for his spot with Lampard favouring striker Norman Bassette in the early stages of his Coventry tenure.\nLampard hasn't been afraid to tweak the line-up and shape either, shifting almost seamlessly between 3-5-2 and 4-3-2-1, whether that be with Simms and Brandon Thomas-Asante up top or Simms on his own.\nTatsuhiro Sakamoto has provided further attacking threat from midfield with three goals and an assist and the return of top goalscorer Haji Wright from injury could yet still prove timely.\n\"We've had challenges, had some injuries, had to change shape, be adaptable,\" Lampard said.\n\"Now we're getting players fit so now we've got this bit more competitive nature to the squad where we can make changes in game.\"\nIf the Sky Blues continue at the same two points per game ratio they've achieved since Lampard took charge, they will end the season on 75 points.\nThat tally would have seen them finish in a play-off spot in 21 of the previous 23 Championship campaigns.\n\"I think we have to feed off our position in a positive way,\" Lampard said.\n\"Our run-in is a challenge. We absolutely have to go game by game. We back ourselves now, we know we can compete, we've shown that in the last period.\n\"But we cannot take our foot off the pedal in terms of our work and our prep and everything we do, so I'm looking forward to seeing if we can keep this form and momentum because we will take some hits in those 11 games.\n\"We've had a really good run but it won't look that way all the time. I'm a realist, I understand. Can we bounce back from those quickly? That will be the test of where we are.\"\nCoventry have lost just once at the CBS Arena in the Championship since Lampard arrived (W6 D1)\nEven in their wildest dreams, Sky Blues fans couldn't have imagined things would be going as well as they are, right here, right now, under Frank Lampard.\nTo say his appointment was greeted by scepticism in some quarters would be something of an understatement, especially given whose shoes he was recruited to fill, and at one point, merely staying in the division would have been regarded as an achievement, never mind challenging for a play-off spot.\nThere have been some bumps in the road; most notably taking an early lead, but then having the floor wiped with them by Portsmouth, and leading 1-0 at Norwich, going into four minutes of added time, only to contrive to lose 2-1.\nHowever, the positives far outweigh the negatives to this point, and some long-standing demons have been exorcised as well - winning in Swansea for the first time in 75 years, and beating Preston in a league match, which hadn't happened since September 2007.\nHow's he done it? To this untrained eye, by instilling much-needed belief in the squad, working extremely hard, both on and off the pitch, collectively and individually with players to extract every last drop of positivity from them, and that approach is reaping huge dividends at the moment.\nAn outstanding example of that occurred just last weekend, at Oxford, when they took the lead twice, were pegged back twice, had a penalty saved at 2-2, and yet still went on to win 3-2.\nTrust me, as someone that's watched every game so far, that would not have happened earlier in the season.\nCredit must go to Lampard's coaches Joe Edwards and Chris Jones too - that's clearly a dynamic that works extremely well, and speaking on behalf of all City fans, long may it continue.\nCoventry have picked up more points than any other Championship side in the past nine games\n\"It's going quite well isn't it,\" Coventry fan Sam Riman told the BBC's Sky Blues fancast.\n\"Earlier this year, I remember saying, 'it's a bit of a write-off season, we'll just see what Lampard can do, see what that brings in the summer and go again next year'.\n\"And now here we are, fifth in the Championship table.\"\nLampard has made a habit of applauding the Coventry fans after each game and fist-pumping to the crowd when they win and BBC CWR sports editor Gurney says it \"shows he's got a bond with the fans by doing that\".\n\"Going back to the end of November when he first came in, he knew the previous incumbent was very popular with the fanbase and he needed to build that relationship pretty quickly and he's done that,\" Gurney said.\nSupporter Adam Sloman said the relationship Lampard has built with the fans was \"arguably the hardest part of the job\".\n\"He was very quick to say about the great work done by his predecessor but he was very careful to make sure he got the fans on side,\" Sloman said.\nLampard reiterated he's \"under no illusions\" how difficult the final two months of the campaign will be and says Coventry must \"guard against any form of complacency to be a top team\".\n\"Some things have come together nicely, it's a lovely period of time because we're winning games,\" he added.\n\"The next challenge is the bigger one. We've got the run-in and the minute you go 'we've cracked it', this game, this Championship will smack you in the face.\n\"There's a long way to make the play-offs, to get through the play-offs to make the final. But if we can do that, it would be huge for this city. \n\"It would be amazing.\"\nYou can watch Frank Lampard's interview with Football Focus on BBC One at 12:00 GMT on Saturday, 8 March.",

        "article_text": "Roman Dobrokhotov is used to looking over his shoulder.\nThe Russian journalist's investigations into Vladimir Putin's regime - one of which unmasked the agents responsible for the 2018 Salisbury poisonings - have made him a target of the Kremlin.\nBut as the Insider editor waited on the tarmac to board a commercial flight from Budapest to Berlin in 2021, where he was to give evidence in a murder trial, he didn't notice the brunette woman stood behind him.\nHe thought nothing of it when she took a seat close to his. Nor did he see the camera strapped to her shoulder, quietly recording.\nThat morning, the woman had flown from Luton to Budapest to locate the mark. Dobrokhotov's flight information had been obtained in advance.\nAs the aircraft approached its destination, the woman, a Bulgarian \u2013 Katrin Ivanova \u2013 sent a message on Telegram.\nThen two more.\nHer partner, Biser Dzhambazov, with whom she lived in Harrow, north London, was waiting for her and Dobrokhotov in Berlin.\nAnother woman, an airport worker identified only as Cvetka, had already flown a dummy run of the route.\nWaiting in Berlin, she was another pair of eyes.\nThey'd lost him.\nOperational for years, the cell tracked Russia's enemies across Europe. Its leaders plotted honeytraps, kidnap and murder in service of the Kremlin. Following a trial, three members were convicted on 7 March at the Old Bailey in London for their part in the conspiracy. Three more had already pleaded guilty.\n\"We're in a situation where only some of us will survive,\" Dobrokhotov would later tell the BBC.\n\"It will be either Russian journalists and human rights watchers, or Vladimir Putin and his killers.\"\nWatching events in Berlin unfold from the UK was the final member of the Telegram group, another Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, 47.\nAn associate recalls Orlin Roussev as a man fascinated by espionage. An email address associated with him includes the 007 sobriquet of the world's most famous secret agent.\nHe moved to Britain in 2009, before he set up a company involved in signals intelligence \u2013 the interception of communications or electronic signals.\nWhen police officers searched the faded 33-room Great Yarmouth former guest house in which he lived with his wife and stepson, they discovered, in the assessment of one expert, \"a vast amount of technical surveillance equipment which could be used to enable intrusive surveillance\".\nThey might have been less dry. It was an Aladdin's cave disguised as a cluttered seaside relic; sophisticated communications interception devices worth \u00a3175,000; radio frequency jammers; covert cameras hidden in smoke detectors, a pen, sunglasses, even men's ties; a horde of fake identity documents and equipment to make more. An encrypted hard drive was left open. Telegram conversations were visible on Roussev's laptop.\nAmong the masses of equipment, police discovered the business card of a one-time finance executive, Jan Marsalek.\nRoussev first met Jan Marsalek in 2015, introduced, he recalled, by a mutual acquaintance he had met at the offices of a British investor and wealth adviser. In emails from that time seen by the BBC, Marsalek enlists Roussev's help in acquiring a secure mobile phone from a Chinese company.\nThen, Jan Marsalek was the respected chief operating officer of German payments processing company Wirecard. While reports criticising Wirecard's business practices had started to appear in the Financial Times,  the company's reputation as a star performer in the European fintech sector, valued in excess of \u00a320 billion at its peak, was intact.\nNow, he was directing operations as Roussev's controller on the run from fraud charges - the subject of an Interpol red notice - following the company's 2020 collapse.\nTogether, the pair conceived operations targeting journalists, dissidents, politicians, even Ukrainian soldiers thought to be training at a US military installation in Stuttgart. They discussed selling US drones captured from Ukrainian battlefields to China. And they did it for Russia.\nLinked to the state's intelligence services, Marsalek is believed to be hiding in Moscow. He faces no charges in the UK.\nThe group Roussev employed, all Bulgarians, were not the spies of popular imagination.\nAlongside Dzhambazov, a medical courier, and Ivanova, a laboratory assistant, he employed a beautician with a salon in Acton, Vanya Gaberova; a painter and decorator, Tihomir Ivanchev; plus an MMA fighter nicknamed \"The Destroyer\" who wore his fights on his face, Ivan Stoyanov.\nA neighbour who knew two of the accused was sceptical they could be guilty. They were too stupid and didn't know anything, the neighbour asserted, though they admired the fighter's \"enormous calves\".\nBut they were not ineffective \u2013 Roman Dobrokhotov recognised none of the group's faces when pictures were shown to him by police.\nThe group operated a clear hierarchy. Roussev reported to Marsalek, who reported to his \"friends in Russia\". Roussev managed the rest of the Bulgarians, who he referred to as his \"minions\", Dzhambazov chief among them.\n\"There are no bosses here,\" Dzambhazov wrote, as he issued instructions to Ivanchev.\nNonetheless, \"minion\" was attached to the decorator's number in Dzhambazov's phone.\nThe group dynamics were complicated. Dzhambazov and Ivanova were in a long term relationship and lived together. Gaberova and Ivanchev were in a relationship until 2022.\nBut it was Dzhambazov and Gaberova police found in bed together when they burst into the beautician's northwest London flat in February 2023.\nBetween August 2020 and February 2023, Marsalek and Roussev exchanged 78,747 messages on the Telegram messaging app.\nThey reveal at least six operations the spy cell was tasked with over a period of years \u2013 four of which targeted individuals who were enemies of Putin's regime.\nAs well as Dobrokhotov, the investigative journalist Christo Grozev was watched at home in Vienna. Cameras in the window of a rented apartment nearby were trained on his front door.\nHe was tailed on flights and photographed in a Valencia hotel eating breakfast with co-founder of the Bellingcat investigative collective Elliott Higgins.\nA thorn in the side of Russian intelligence services, he was observed in Bulgaria meeting with an arms trader who had been the victim of an assassination attempt Grozev linked to the Russian state.\nGaberova was instructed to befriend him.\nIn Montenegro, the cell searched for Kirill Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until he fell foul of the Kremlin. They were anxious to impress. A second Russian intelligence team circled, including a chain-smoking blonde woman referred to only as \"Red Sparrow\".\nMarsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnap and murder of both Grozev and Kachur. It wasn't an empty threat \u2013 a colleague of Kachur's had separately been taken to Moscow.\nA former Kazakh politician living with refugee status in London, Bergey Ryskaliyev, was targeted at a luxury apartment in Hyde Park. Further reconnaissance took place at his home.\nIvan Stoyanov, who acknowledged his part in the conspiracy, was spotted parked in a Toyota Prius outside his address. Suspicious, an assistant of Mr Ryskaliyev noted the licence plate.\nWhen confronted, the MMA fighter claimed he was working for a Kensington hospital, delivering tests. The next day, an NHS logo had been placed in the windscreen.\nProsecutors said providing information on a political dissident like Ryskaliyev \"is predicated on Russian attempts to control diplomatic relations\".\nIndeed, Marsalek would further task Roussev with another project: a hare-brained scheme to initiate a staged protest at the Kazakh Embassy featuring blood dropped from drones, an astroturf human rights campaign involving Just Stop Oil, a letter addressed to the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, advertising on London buses and unrealised deepfake pornographic video of the Kazakh president's son. Russia would then help nervous Kazakh security services \"uncover\" the \"activists\" responsible.\nIn February 2022, Telegram exchanges between Marsalek and Roussev reveal a preoccupation with following Christo Grozev to Kyiv, where he was believed to have travelled.\nTheir offers to help were rebuffed.\nFewer than three weeks later, Russian tanks surged across Ukraine's eastern, southern and northern borders.\nLater that year, Marsalek asked Roussev if one of the cell's three IMSI grabbers \u2013 sophisticated communications interception equipment \u2013 could be deployed to spy on Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. Roussev promised to retrieve it from his \"Indiana Jones garage\", where it was \"gathering dust\".\nMarsalek returned to the idea repeatedly.\nBy February 2023, Roussev and Marsalek were plotting to send Dzhambazov and \"one more person\" to Stuttgart, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers to be training on Patriot missile systems.\nHad they successfully deployed and captured Ukrainian troops' mobile phone data as planned, they might have used it to pinpoint those same troops on the battlefield \u2013 leading Russian forces to Western-supplied Ukrainian air defences.\n\"This was espionage activity of the highest level of seriousness,\" prosecutor Alison Morgan KC told the jury at the Old Bailey.\nBefore their plans could be put into action, they were arrested \u2013 Dzhambazov, Ivanova, Gaberova and Stoyanov in London, Roussev in his guest house.\nThough Ivanchev identified himself to police outside Gaberova's flat, he would not be arrested for another year.\nIn his first police interview, he told officers he had spoken to MI5 in the interim. The interview was paused.\nNone of the six denied their actions.\nRoussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov pleaded guilty before trial. Ivanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev denied knowing they were working for Russia.\nThe jury disagreed.\nIvanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev were found guilty after the jury deliberated for over 32 hours. Ivanova was also found guilty of possessing multiple false identity documents.\nThey could face up to 14 years in prison.

        "article_text": "Florida has launched a criminal investigation into controversial British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate. \nAt the end of February, the brothers flew to the US from Romania, where they face rape and human-trafficking charges - which they deny.\nAndrew Tate, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, are dual US-UK citizens who claim to have made millions from their social media empire.\nTheir online output was controversial even before their legal troubles, with the pair attracting frequent criticism over offensive statements about women.\nThe pair have an American father who worked for the US Air Force in Britain. Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US.\nAfter their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers.\nPolice in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls.\nThe brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK.\nThe brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.\nSpeculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.\nThey flew from Bucharest to Florida on a private jet on 27 February.\nProsecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. \nThe Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.\nEarlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.\nIt came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference.\nHurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell's approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident.\nThe Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while Trump's close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate's account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022.\nIn the US, the brothers are facing a civil lawsuit from a women who alleges they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny the allegations.\nIn a statement issued on 4 March, Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said that he had directed his office and law enforcement partners \"to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate\".\nHe added: \"Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers.\"\nIn response, a statement from the Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride called Uthmeier's comments \"inflammatory\" and \"biased\".\n\"He publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,\" he added.\nThe cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March.\nThe pair's request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected.\nThe brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases.\nThey are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They deny the charges.\nThey face separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK, which they also deny. In March 2024, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concluded.\nSeparately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".\nA representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".\nA separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders.\nThe brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said.\nA Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said.\nThe assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac.\nSome of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"\nFour women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they were in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by his departure from Romania.\nIn a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"\nThey also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".\nMatthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.\nHe added he didn't think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\".",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Uncle Harry... he's the best supporter ever' - Lampard\nTaking over from the EFL's longest-serving boss was never going to be an easy task for Frank Lampard.\nMark Robins had spent seven years with Coventry City, won two promotions, nearly reached the Premier League and then almost guided them to an FA Cup final just six months before he was sacked on 7 November last year.\nThey were big shoes to fill.\n\"I like to prove people wrong,\" Lampard said following his appointment - a decision that was not universally backed by the Sky Blues fanbase at the time.\nThe former Chelsea, Everton and Derby County manager has already gone some way to doing just that following an impressive recent run of form.\nWhen Lampard took over three weeks after Robins left, Coventry were 17th in the Championship, 10 points from the play-off spots and only two points above the relegation zone.\nA little more than three months later and Coventry are now fifth, propelled by eight wins from their past nine, losing only against leaders Leeds United in that time.\nWith their next test the visit of Stoke City - and return of Robins to the CBS Arena for the first time since his departure - BBC Sport takes a look at Lampard's progress in the West Midlands so far.\nCoventry are leading a tight group of at least seven teams realistically fighting for the two final play-off spots\nLampard says he \"didn't envisage\" climbing the table so quickly to challenge for the play-offs but also isn't \"getting carried away with where we are now\".\n\"I felt that we could improve and work ourselves up the table but the reality was, we were looking behind as much as ahead for a few weeks when we first got in,\" Lampard told BBC Football Focus.\n\"It's not easy to bring confidence, it's not easy to find the things in the team we need to correct, to be more compact.\n\"These things have to take a bit of work and time, so I wasn't sure how quickly it would happen.\n\"We're not going to get automatic promotion, we know that gap is too big. But can we do everything in our power to close the gap? I thought we could, I just didn't think we would get in as quickly.\n\"So, the next challenge is to show consistency.\"\nCoventry last won eight games from nine in the 1969-70 season\nCoventry are on their best run in the league for 55 years in terms of sheer points accumulation over a nine-game period.\nTheir recent tally of eight wins in nine matches is their most since they did the same between November 1969 and February 1970, in what was then Division One (now the Premier League).\nThe Sky Blues strung together 14 games without defeat in 2020 (W11 D3) on the way to winning League One under Robins, also between January and March, but didn't exceed 24 points in any nine consecutive outings despite that streak.\nSimilarly, Lampard has never been on such a run during his managerial career, even when he took Derby to the Championship play-offs in 2018-19, nor with Chelsea the following campaign when the Blues finished fourth in the top flight.\nCoventry have scored more regularly and conceded less frequently under Lampard compared to Robins\nThe Lampard effect is clear to see, with Coventry improving on every metric in the Championship compared to Robins this season.\nThey have scored more goals per game under Lampard (1.50) than Robins (1.28) and also conceded fewer in each match (1.05 compared to 1.35).\n\"When you get in, you try and analyse the problems quickly and we were conceding too many goals,\" Lampard said.\n\"We weren't compact enough, we weren't aggressive enough, so we tried to really prioritise our off the ball work.\n\"The players have done it because they've bought into everything we've tried to say.\n\"I have to say, this group of players, the humility, the application of them is absolutely amazing.\"\nAmong the standout performers who have improved under Lampard are creative midfielder Jack Rudoni and winger Ephron Mason-Clark.\nNo other Coventry player has had more goal contributions than Rudoni since Lampard arrived, scoring three goals and providing six assists, while Mason-Clark has netted four times and laid on another four in that time.\nStriker Ellis Simms has also seen an upturn in performances, putting opposing defenders under more pressure than previously, and his output has increased, grabbing four goals and an assist, compared to just two goals under Robins.\nThat has perhaps stemmed from Simms having to fight for his spot with Lampard favouring striker Norman Bassette in the early stages of his Coventry tenure.\nLampard hasn't been afraid to tweak the line-up and shape either, shifting almost seamlessly between 3-5-2 and 4-3-2-1, whether that be with Simms and Brandon Thomas-Asante up top or Simms on his own.\nTatsuhiro Sakamoto has provided further attacking threat from midfield with three goals and an assist and the return of top goalscorer Haji Wright from injury could yet still prove timely.\n\"We've had challenges, had some injuries, had to change shape, be adaptable,\" Lampard said.\n\"Now we're getting players fit so now we've got this bit more competitive nature to the squad where we can make changes in game.\"\nIf the Sky Blues continue at the same two points per game ratio they've achieved since Lampard took charge, they will end the season on 75 points.\nThat tally would have seen them finish in a play-off spot in 21 of the previous 23 Championship campaigns.\n\"I think we have to feed off our position in a positive way,\" Lampard said.\n\"Our run-in is a challenge. We absolutely have to go game by game. We back ourselves now, we know we can compete, we've shown that in the last period.\n\"But we cannot take our foot off the pedal in terms of our work and our prep and everything we do, so I'm looking forward to seeing if we can keep this form and momentum because we will take some hits in those 11 games.\n\"We've had a really good run but it won't look that way all the time. I'm a realist, I understand. Can we bounce back from those quickly? That will be the test of where we are.\"\nCoventry have lost just once at the CBS Arena in the Championship since Lampard arrived (W6 D1)\nEven in their wildest dreams, Sky Blues fans couldn't have imagined things would be going as well as they are, right here, right now, under Frank Lampard.\nTo say his appointment was greeted by scepticism in some quarters would be something of an understatement, especially given whose shoes he was recruited to fill, and at one point, merely staying in the division would have been regarded as an achievement, never mind challenging for a play-off spot.\nThere have been some bumps in the road; most notably taking an early lead, but then having the floor wiped with them by Portsmouth, and leading 1-0 at Norwich, going into four minutes of added time, only to contrive to lose 2-1.\nHowever, the positives far outweigh the negatives to this point, and some long-standing demons have been exorcised as well - winning in Swansea for the first time in 75 years, and beating Preston in a league match, which hadn't happened since September 2007.\nHow's he done it? To this untrained eye, by instilling much-needed belief in the squad, working extremely hard, both on and off the pitch, collectively and individually with players to extract every last drop of positivity from them, and that approach is reaping huge dividends at the moment.\nAn outstanding example of that occurred just last weekend, at Oxford, when they took the lead twice, were pegged back twice, had a penalty saved at 2-2, and yet still went on to win 3-2.\nTrust me, as someone that's watched every game so far, that would not have happened earlier in the season.\nCredit must go to Lampard's coaches Joe Edwards and Chris Jones too - that's clearly a dynamic that works extremely well, and speaking on behalf of all City fans, long may it continue.\nCoventry have picked up more points than any other Championship side in the past nine games\n\"It's going quite well isn't it,\" Coventry fan Sam Riman told the BBC's Sky Blues fancast.\n\"Earlier this year, I remember saying, 'it's a bit of a write-off season, we'll just see what Lampard can do, see what that brings in the summer and go again next year'.\n\"And now here we are, fifth in the Championship table.\"\nLampard has made a habit of applauding the Coventry fans after each game and fist-pumping to the crowd when they win and BBC CWR sports editor Gurney says it \"shows he's got a bond with the fans by doing that\".\n\"Going back to the end of November when he first came in, he knew the previous incumbent was very popular with the fanbase and he needed to build that relationship pretty quickly and he's done that,\" Gurney said.\nSupporter Adam Sloman said the relationship Lampard has built with the fans was \"arguably the hardest part of the job\".\n\"He was very quick to say about the great work done by his predecessor but he was very careful to make sure he got the fans on side,\" Sloman said.\nLampard reiterated he's \"under no illusions\" how difficult the final two months of the campaign will be and says Coventry must \"guard against any form of complacency to be a top team\".\n\"Some things have come together nicely, it's a lovely period of time because we're winning games,\" he added.\n\"The next challenge is the bigger one. We've got the run-in and the minute you go 'we've cracked it', this game, this Championship will smack you in the face.\n\"There's a long way to make the play-offs, to get through the play-offs to make the final. But if we can do that, it would be huge for this city. \n\"It would be amazing.\"\nYou can watch Frank Lampard's interview with Football Focus on BBC One at 12:00 GMT on Saturday, 8 March.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has hit China with a second tariff in as many months, which means imports from there now face a levy of at least 20%.\nThis is his latest salvo against Beijing, which already faces steep US tariffs, from 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles to 15% on clothes and shoes. \nTrump's tariffs strike at the heart of China's manufacturing juggernaut - a web of factories, assembly lines and supply chains that manufacture and ship just about everything, from fast fashion and toys to solar panels and electric cars.\nChina's trade surplus with the world rose to a record $1tn (\u00a3788bn) in 2024, on the back of strong exports ($3.5tn), which surpassed its import bill ($2.5tn).\nIt has long been the world's factory - it has thrived because of cheap labour and state investment in infrastructure ever since it opened its economy to global business in the late 1970s. \nSo how badly could Trump's trade war hurt China's manufacturing success?\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nMost tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods, and it's generally the importer who pays them.\nSo, a 10% tariff means a product imported to the US from China worth $4 would face an additional $0.40 charge applied to it.\nIncreasing the price of imported goods is meant to encourage consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead, thus helping to boost their own economy's growth.\nTrump sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. But economic studies of the impact of tariffs which Trump imposed during his first term in office, suggest the measures ultimately raised prices for US consumers.\nTrump has said his most recent tariffs are aimed at pressuring China to do more to stop the flow of the opioid fentanyl to the US. \nHe also imposed 25% tariffs on America's neighbours Mexico and Canada, saying its leaders were not doing enough to crack down on the cross-border illegal drug trade.\nYes, analysts say. \nExports have been the \"saving grace\" of China's economy and if the taxes linger,  exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third, Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's analytics, told the BBC. \nThe sheer value of China's exports - which account for a fifth of the country's earnings - means that a 20% tariff could weaken demand from overseas and shrink the trade surplus. \n\"The tariffs will hurt China,\" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong, told the BBC. \"They really need to do much more. They need to do what Xi Jinping has already said - boost domestic demand.\"\nThat is a tall task in an economy where the property market is slumping and disillusioned youth are struggling to find high-paying jobs. \nChinese people have not been spending enough to recharge the economy - and Beijing has just announced a slew of stimulus measures to boost consumption.\nWhile tariffs can slow Chinese manufacturing, they cannot stop or replace it that easily, analysts say.\n\"Not only is China the big exporter, it is sometimes the only exporter like for solar panels. If you want solar panels you can only go to China,\" Ms Garcia-Herrero said.\nChina had begun pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such  as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) long before Trump became president. And that has given China an \"early mover\" advantage, not to mention the scale of production in the world's second-largest economy.\nChinese factories can produce high-end tech in large quantities at a low cost, said Shuang Ding, chief China economist at Standard Chartered.\n\"It's really difficult to find a replacement... China's status as a market leader is very difficult to topple.\"\nChina has responded with counter tariffs of 10-15% on US agricultural goods, coal, liquefied natural gas, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars.\nAnd it has targeted US firms in aviation, defence and tech with export restrictions and announced an anti-monopoly investigation against Google.\nChina has also spent years adapting to tariffs from Trump's first term. Some Chinese manufacturers have moved factories out of the country, for instance. And supply chains have come to rely more on Vietnam and Mexico by exporting from there to bypass the tariffs.         \nAnd yet, Trump's recent  tariffs on Mexico would not hurt China too much because  Vietnam is a bigger backdoor for Chinese goods, Ms Garcia-Herrero said.\n\"Vietnam is the key here. If tariffs are imposed on Vietnam, I think it will be very tough,\" she said.\nWhat concerns China more than tariffs, analysts says, is US restrictions on advanced chips. \nThese restrictions have been a major sticking point between the two countries but they have also fuelled China's determination to invest in homegrown tech that is independent of the West.  \nIt's why Chinese AI firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm had reportedly stockpiled Nvidia chips before the US began cutting off China's access to the most advanced ones.  \nAlthough this could \"impact China's competitiveness, I don't think that would affect China's status as a manufacturing power,\" Mr Ding of Standard Chartered said.\nOn the other hand, any ground China gains in advanced tech manufacturing will  boost its high-value exports. \nIt happened because of state support, an unrivalled supply chain and cheap labour, analysts say.\n\"The combination of globalisation, as well as China's pro-business policies and market potential, helped to attract the initial wave of foreign investors,\" Chim Lee, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told the BBC.\nThe government then doubled down, investing heavily in building a sprawling network of roads and ports to bring in raw materials and take Chinese-made goods to the world. What also helped was a stable exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar.   \nA shift in recent years towards advanced tech has made sure that it will continue to be relevant and ahead of its competitors, analysts say.\nChina already has plenty of economic clout from being a manufacturing powerhouse. But there is also a political opportunity as Trump's tariffs upend America's relationship with the world. \n\"The door is ajar for China to position itself as an advocate of free trade and a stable global force,\" said Mr Cruise of Moody's.\nBut that is not easy, given Beijing has been accused of flouting international trade norms, such as imposing a tariff of more than 200% on imports of Australian wine in 2020.\nAnalysts say China must also look beyond the US, which is still the top destination for its exports. China is the third-biggest market for US exports, after Canada and Mexico. \nChinese trade with Europe, South East Asia and Latin America has been growing, but it's hard to imagine that the world's two biggest economies can stop relying on each other.

        "article_text": "Two years ago, on his bank adviser's suggestion, Rajesh Kumar pulled out his savings - fixed deposits included - and shifted to mutual funds, stocks and bonds.\nWith India's stock market booming, Mr Kumar, a Bihar-based engineer, joined millions investing in publicly traded companies. Six years ago, only one in 14 Indian households channelled their savings into the stock market - now, it's one in five.\nBut the tide has turned. \nFor six months, India's markets have slid as foreign investors pulled out, valuations remained high, earnings weakened and global capital shifted to China - wiping out $900bn in investor value since their September peak. While the decline began before US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, they have now become a bigger drag as more details emerge.\nIndia's benchmark Nifty 50 share index, which tracks the country's top 50 publicly traded companies, is on its longest losing streak in 29 years, declining for five straight months. This is a significant slump in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Stock brokers are reporting that their activity has dropped by a third.  \n\"For more than six months now, my investments have been in the red. This is the worst experience in the last decade that I have been invested in stock market,\" Mr Kumar says.\nMr Kumar, 55, now keeps little money in the bank, having shifted most of his savings to the stock market. With his son's 1.8 million-rupee ($20,650; \u00a316,150) private medical college fee due in July, he worries about selling investments at a loss to cover it. \"Once the market recovers, I'm thinking of moving some money back to the bank,\" he says.\nHis anxieties reflect those of millions of middle-class Indians who have poured into the stock market from cities big and small - part of a financial revolution. \nThe go-to investment route is Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), where funds collect fixed monthly contributions. The number of Indians investing through SIPs has soared past 100 million, nearly trebling from 34 million five years ago. Many first-time investors, lured by the promise of high returns, enter with limited risk awareness - often influenced by a wave of social media \"finfluencers\" on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, a mixed bag of experts and amateurs alike.\nMeet Tarun Sircar, a retired marketing manager, and you get a glimpse of India's new investor. \nWhen his public provident fund - a government-backed tax-free investment - matured last year, he sought a way to secure his retirement. Burnt by past stock market losses, he turned to mutual funds - this time with an adviser's help and a buoyant market. \n\"I've put 80% of my savings into mutual funds, keeping just 20% in the bank. Now my adviser warns me - Don't check your investments for six months, unless you want a heart attack!\"\nFor now, Mr Sircar isn't entirely sure if moving his retirement fund into the stock market was the right decision. \"I'm both ignorant and confident,\" he says with wry candour. \"Ignorant about what's happening and why the market is reacting this way, yet confident because Instagram 'experts' make investing sound like a fast track to millions. At the same time, I know I might be caught in a web of deception and hype.\"\nMr Sircar says he was drawn to the markets by TV shows hyping stocks and excited chatter in WhatsApp groups. \"The TV anchors talk up the market and people in my WhatsApp group boast about their stock market gains,\" he says. \nIn his sprawling apartment complex, even teenagers discuss investments - in fact, during a badminton game, a teenager gave him a hot tip on a telecom stock. \"When you hear all this around you, you start thinking - why not give it a shot? So I did, and then the markets crashed.\"\nMr Sircar lives in hope. \"My fingers are crossed. I am sure the markets will recover, and my fund will be back in green.\"\nThere are others who have taken more risks and already lost money. Lured by get-rich-quick videos, Ramesh (name changed), an accounting clerk from a small industrial town in western India, borrowed money to invest in stocks during the pandemic.\nHooked to YouTube influencers, he dived into risky penny stocks and trading in derivatives. This month, after losing over $1,800 - more than his annual salary - he shut his brokerage account and swore off the market.\n\"I borrowed this money, and now creditors are after me,\" he says.\nRamesh is one of 11 million Indians who lost a combined $20bn in futures and options trades before regulators stepped in. \n\"This crash is unlike the one during the Covid pandemic,\" says financial adviser Samir Doshi. \"Back then, we had a clear path to recovery with vaccines on the horizon. But with the Trump factor in play, uncertainty looms - we simply don't know what's next.\"\nFuelled by digital platforms, low-cost brokerages and government-driven financial inclusion, investing has become more accessible - smartphones and user-friendly apps have simplified market participation, drawing a broader, younger audience seeking alternatives to traditional assets.\nOn the flip side, many new Indian investors need a reality check. \"The stock market isn't a gambling den - you must manage expectations,\" says Monika Halan, author and financial educator. \"Invest in equity only what you won't need for at least seven years. If you're taking on risk, understand the downside: How much could I lose? Can I afford that loss?\"\nThis market crash couldn't have hit India's middle class at a worse time. Economic growth is slowing, wages remain stagnant, private investment has been sluggish for years and job creation isn't keeping pace. Amid these challenges, many new investors, lured by rising markets, are now grappling with unexpected losses.\n\"In normal times, savers can take short-term setbacks, because they have steady incomes, which keep adding to their savings,\" noted Aunindyo Chakravarty, a financial analyst.\n\"Now, we are in the midst of a massive economic crisis for the middle-class. On the one side, white-collar job opportunities are reducing, and raises are low. On the other, the real inflation faced by middle-class households - as opposed to the average retail inflation that the government compiles - is at its highest in recent memory. A stock market correction at such a time is disastrous for middle-class household finances.\"\nFinancial advisers like Jaideep Marathe believe that some people will start taking money out of the market and move them to safer bank deposits if the volatility continues for another six to eight months. \"We are spending a lot of time telling clients not to liquidate their portfolios and to treat this as a cyclical event.\"  \nBut clearly, all hope is not lost - most believe that the market is correcting itself from previous highs.\nForeign investor selling has eased since February, suggesting the market downturn may be nearing its end, says veteran market expert Ajay Bagga. Following the correction, valuations for many stock market indices have dipped below their 10-year average, providing some respite.\nMr Bagga expects GDP and corporate earnings to improve, aided by a $12bn income-tax giveaway in the federal budget and falling interest rates. However, geopolitical risks - Middle East and Ukraine conflicts, and Trump's tariff plans - will keep investors cautious.\nIn the end, the market meltdown might serve as a hard lesson for new investors. \n\"This correction is a much-needed wake-up call for those who entered the market just three years ago, enjoying 25% returns - that's not normal,\" says Ms Halan. \"If you don't understand markets, stick to bank deposits and gold. At least you have control.\"   \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "In January, days after the first-month anniversary of the fall of the Assad regime in a lightning Islamist-led rebel offensive in Syria, a group of young men - some of them armed - were gathered, checking their phones in the nearly empty interior ministry headquarters in Damascus.\nWith Bashar al-Assad gone, they had arrived from Idlib, a region in the country's north-west that for years was the only opposition-controlled province in the country.\nVirtually overnight, they had been catapulted to positions once controlled by hand-picked Assad supporters and, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, were in charge of a fractured country devastated by 13 years of civil war.\nOne of them, around 30 years old, had recently been appointed as a high-profile security official, and welcomed me to a room where any sign of the old regime had been removed. Tall and shy, the official made notes on his iPad while acknowledging that the new rulers faced enormous security challenges, including the threat coming from Assad loyalists.\nThe dismantling of the decades-old apparatus behind the oppressive machine of the Assads, such as the country's army and the ruling Baath party, meant the sacking of hundreds of thousands of people.\n\"There are Assad-affiliated people who haven't engaged with the reconciliation process,\" said the official, who requested anonymity to be able to discuss sensitive issues, citing the new authorities' call for former members of the security forces to surrender their weapons and ties to the old government.\n\"Our eyes are on everyone, but we don't want to give the impression that we're after them. That's why there haven't been massive raids.\"\nSince then the violence has escalated, particularly in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous, a stronghold of the Assad family, but clashes were relatively contained. Until Thursday.\nAs forces linked to the government carried out an operation in the countryside of Latakia province, targeting a former Assad official, they were ambushed by gunmen. \nAt least 13 members of the security forces were killed, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, in what a regional official described as a well-planned attack carried out by \"remnants of the Assad militias\".\nInitially limited to the Jableh area, the unrest spread more widely. Videos posted online showed heavy gunfire in different areas. The authorities sent reinforcements and, on Friday, further clashes killed more than 120 people, the Syrian Observatory said. \nIt marked the most violent day since Assad's fall and the biggest challenge yet to interim President Sharaa's transitional government and his efforts to consolidate authority.\nAccording to the Institute for the Study of War, a research group, former Assad regime members are likely to form the most effective insurgent cells against Syria's new rulers with the ability to coordinate attacks.\n\"[They] already have pre-existing networks that they can leverage to rapidly organize insurgent cells. These networks are military, intelligence, and political networks and criminal syndicates who were regime supporters and lost significant economic and political influence in the aftermath of Assad's fall,\" they said in a report.\nSyria's coastal areas are also the heartland of Assad's Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam. Its members held prominent roles in the Assad government but, with the arrival of Sunni Muslim-led rebels, lost the power and privilege they once had. They now say they are under attack and discrimination, despite Sharaa's pledges to respect different religious sects. \nOn Friday, activists said gunmen had killed dozens of male residents in Alawite areas, which will further exacerbate tensions \u2013 and possibly drive support for insurgents in their anti-government push. The Syrian Observatory said the gunmen were from the government's security forces, although this has not been verified.\nThe authorities also faced resistance from the Druze forces in the south, although a deal was reached earlier this week\nThe government in Damascus does not control the whole of Syria, where different factions - supported by different countries - exercise power over different regions. \nBut for Sharaa, the challenge goes beyond the task of trying to keep the country safe. \nAs Western suspicions over his intentions continue, his authorities are also struggling to get crippling sanctions imposed on Syria under the former regime lifted, a vital move to revive the economy of a country where nine in every 10 people are in poverty.",

        "article_text": "Max Verstappen is aiming to become only the second driver to win five successive drivers' championships in 2025\nRed Bull might have won the world drivers' title for the fourth year in a row with Max Verstappen last year, but they head into the new season under conspicuous pressure.\nThey have lost their design guru, following Adrian Newey's move to Aston Martin, rivals are circling around Verstappen, and over the second half of last year, Red Bull had only the third fastest car in Formula 1.\nSo what is at stake for Red Bull as they head into the final year of F1's current regulations?\nVerstappen's fourth title was founded on the points advantage he built in a brief period of dominance at the start of the year, and an outstanding performance from the Dutchman for the remainder of the season.\nFrom the sixth race of the season in Miami, the car no longer retained the massive advantage over the rest of the field it had enjoyed in the first five races, or the two preceding years.\nYes, it ended the year as on average the fastest car in qualifying - by 0.052 seconds over the McLaren. But take the numbers from Miami onwards and the McLaren was faster by 0.053secs. Over the second half the season, the McLaren was faster by 0.142secs and Red Bull were also slower than Ferrari - by 0.008secs.\nHad McLaren started the season in a stronger position, therefore, Verstappen's championship would have been a lot harder to win.\nRed Bull's issue was that a fundamental balance disconnect became more apparent as they tried to add performance to their car. They struggled to solve their mid-corner, slow-speed understeer without creating oversteer in the fast corners.\nNewey said: \"Already through the very last stages of '23, the car was starting to become more difficult to drive,\" Newey said. \"Max could handle it. Checo (Sergio Perez) couldn't.\n\"That carried into the first part of '24, but the car was still quick enough to be able to cope with it.\n\"It's something I was starting to become concerned about, but not many other people in the organisation seemed to be very concerned about it.\n\"And from what I can see from the outside, but I don't know\u2026 the guys at Red Bull, this is no criticism, but I think they just \u2013 perhaps through lack of experience \u2013 kept going in that same (development) direction. And the problem became more and more acute, to the point that even Max found it difficult to drive.\"\nRed Bull believe they lost ground because they did not exploit aero-elasticity of front wings as much as McLaren, Mercedes and later Ferrari.\nThis method of construction enables teams to build the carbon-fibre in their front-wing in such a way as to have the elements flex downwards at high speed, reducing downforce and therefore oversteer, but have them move back into optimum downforce mode at slower speeds.\nNew rules for this season limit the flexibility of wings - at the rear from the first race, and at the front from the Spanish Grand Prix in June.\nThe question is whether this was the sole issue Red Bull faced, and whether they can catch up the ground McLaren and Ferrari made last year, and whatever development progress their rivals have made over the winter.\nNewey's departure came in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment and coercive, controlling behaviour made against team principal Christian Horner by a female employee.\nHorner has always denied the allegations and was cleared by two separate Red Bull internal investigations. But they unsettled Newey, and added to the disquiet Red Bull's design chief was already feeling about internal politics within the engineering team.\nThere was a disagreement as to who was primarily responsible for Red Bull's recent success. Newey felt technical director Pierre Wache was unfairly pushing for credit - and Horner backed him publicly.

But on average he was slightly slower than team-mate Yuki Tsunoda in qualifying.\nThere is no doubt that Perez's failings last year cost the team dearly in the constructors' championship.\nHe finished last out of all the drivers from the top four teams, and failed to score a podium finish after the fifth race of the season in China. That was a major factor in Red Bull slumping to third in the teams' title chase behind McLaren and Ferrari.\nBut Perez's average qualifying deficit to Verstappen was just over 0.4secs, which is better than Alex Albon managed in 2020 and Pierre Gasly in 2019 before each was dropped. And Albon and Gasly have gone on to produce impressive performances for their new teams, Williams and Alpine.\nLawson will be under pressure to prove he is a step up from Perez, or the decision-making process of Red Bull management will come back under scrutiny.\n'I know my time will come' - Russell exclusive\nNetflix series shows moment Horner learns of alleged messages\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

Nevertheless, Newey's departure gives Wache and the rest of the design team a chance to prove themselves out of Newey's shadow.It is a chance for Red Bull to prove a point, but it could go either way.Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko has already been quoted saying that he believed the team were slower to get on top of their problems in 2024 than they would have been had Newey still been involved.If they cannot return to having the best car, then there will be a major spotlight on Red Bull and serious questions being asked.Could Verstappen leave?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Max and Jos Verstappen with Red Bull team boss Christian Horner during pre-season testing in Bahrain last monthThe pressure on Red Bull is all the greater because of the potential ramifications of this year on Verstappen's future.The Dutchman, 27, is under contract to Red Bull until the end of 2028, but his deal has performance clauses in it - the details of which are not known publicly. Will it hold?And it remains to be seen whether the complainant will take matters further legally.What about Verstappen's team-mate?After two seasons of Sergio Perez struggling alongside Verstappen, Red Bull finally lost patience with the Mexican at the end of last year and paid him off.That decision was very expensive - it was made despite Horner deciding in the early summer last year to grant Perez a two-year contract extension to the end of 2026, when they could have signed Carlos Sainz instead.In Perez's place, Red Bull have promoted New Zealander Liam Lawson.Horner acknowledges that being Verstappen's team-mate is probably the toughest job in F1, and Red Bull are asking Lawson to come in and do better than Perez after a career that has so far spanned only 11 grands prix for Red Bull's second team over two seasons.Can Lawson improve on Perez's performance?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liam Lawson drove five F1 races for Red Bull's second team in 2023 and six in 2024Lawson put in some creditable and combative performances on his return last year, following Red Bull's decision to drop Daniel Ricciardo from their Racing Bulls team.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nRussell won't 'bow down' to Verstappen\nGeorge Russell looks you in the eye and oozes self-belief as he describes how he feels heading into his seventh season in Formula 1, his first as effective leader of the Mercedes team.\n\"I know my time will come,\" the 27-year-old Briton says. \"And I've just got to ensure that I keep on performing. And whether it's this year or next year, it'll come.\n\"And if I keep delivering those results, as I did over these last three years against the best driver of all time, I believe I will get myself in the fight and hopefully a world championship to my name.\"\nRussell's self-confidence is deeply held, and has been there for as long as he has been racing. But it has been nurtured by the time he spent at Mercedes as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton.\nLast year, Russell became the first driver in Hamilton's 18-year career to comprehensively beat the seven-time champion in qualifying over a full season. The head-to-head score was 19-five to Russell, at an average advantage of 0.171 seconds a lap.\nAnd over their three years together since 2022, Russell finished ahead in the championship in two of them.\nThere are caveats - not least that Hamilton's final year at Mercedes came after he had told the team he was leaving them for Ferrari at the end of it.\nBut, as Russell puts it in an exclusive interview with BBC Sport: \"The results speak for themselves. And I don't have anything I need to prove or show.\n\"I am proud of the results I've achieved going up against somebody like Lewis.\n\"At the end of 2021, statistically and in terms of perception, Lewis was the greatest of all time. And I've had three years against the greatest of all time, and I finished ahead of him two out of the three years I had as team-mates. And finished ahead more times in 'quali' and more times in the race.\n\"If this was a different time or a different era, if you finish ahead of Lewis Hamilton, you're a world champion.\"\nWith Hamilton's departure, Russell, becomes the senior driver at Mercedes. His new team-mate is Andrea Kimi Antonelli, an 18-year-old Italian prodigy who has been on Mercedes' books for several years.\n\"He's a great kid,\" Russell says. \"He's very young, but he's a really nice guy. Super-fast, of course.\n\"Being thrown in at the deep end, which is going to be a big challenge. But in terms of raw speed, I don't think you can question it. And there's going to be an interesting new dynamic.\"\nHamilton's departure, Russell says, referencing the explosion of interest the move to Ferrari has created, \"has been good for everyone\".\n\"This is turning a page,\" Russell says about a team that had employed Hamilton for 12 years. \"It's a new chapter. And I don't suddenly feel any additional responsibility.\"\nAnd what does he think Hamilton faces at Ferrari, alongside new team-mate Charles Leclerc, against whom Russell has raced since they were boys in karting?\n\"Charles is a fantastic driver,\" Russell says. \"No doubt about that. So I'm going to be really intrigued to see how that pans out because they're two amazing drivers.\n\"He's obviously entering an Italian team where Charles has been very much the number one for the past six years. It's quite an interesting dynamic, but I think it'll be close between the two of them.\"\nGeorge Russell and Max Verstappen criticised each other publically after a dispute at last year's Qatar Grand Prix\nThere is one big elephant in the room as Mercedes head into 2025 - and its name is Max Verstappen.\nTeam boss Toto Wolff has said the team \"very much hope that the 2025 line-up will be the line-up going forward\". But it is no secret that that Wolff courted Verstappen last year, and still has hopes of attracting him to the team - perhaps as early as 2026.\nIf he succeeds, one of the current drivers - both of whom have been nurtured by the team for years - would have to find a seat elsewhere.\nRussell is aware of this as a potential scenario, but professes not to be remotely concerned about it.\n\"I don't think there's any pressure whatsoever,\" he says \"All I need to do is continue doing what I'm doing, continue doing what I've done my whole career.\n\"So that changes nothing. And it's not even something I'm thinking about. Because I 100% back myself. It's as simple as that. You perform and everything will be there for you.\n\"I want to go up against the best. I don't feel that my ability is in question.\"\nThe Verstappen question is given added edge when it comes to Russell because of their personal history. The pair had a major falling out at the end of last season and there is no sign of relations thawing this. \nRussell says: \"I wasn't going to just stand and be bullied around. People seem to always back down to him. And that's just not how I go about my business.\n\"I'm not there to be best mates with a world champion. I'm here to win. And that's his mentality as well. There's no love lost.\n\"I've never been scared to race against Max. I've always put up a fight.\"\n\nGeorge Russell set the fastest time on the final day of pre-season testing in Bahrain on 28 February\nTense as the situation may be between Russell and Verstappen, any battles between them may not be for a race win at the start of the season, Russell believes.\n\"I don't think either of us right now have a car that potentially is capable of beating the McLaren,\" he says.\n\"McLaren, without doubt, look by far the strongest. Especially their race pace looks pretty impressive.\"\nMercedes won four races last year - two each for Russell and Hamilton - and have come into 2025 hoping for a car with more rounded abilities that can be competitive everywhere, rather than only on certain tracks and in certain conditions, as last year.\n\"There's definitely improvements throughout the car, no doubt about it,\" Russell says. \"Naturally, there's always something you need to work on.\n\"So, you know, we struggled a bit with low-speed understeer last year. There's still signs of that that we're still trying to get on top of, and we think we've got some things in the locker to try and cure those issues. But definitely the car's feeling a bit more together.\"\nRussell's focus this year will not only be on the track. As a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, he will also be forced to confront the concerns many in F1 have about the conduct of Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the president of governing body the FIA.\nA series of Ben Sulayem's actions have angered the drivers in recent years, and over the winter, new rules codifying a process by which drivers can face race bans for swearing have increased concerns. \nRussell chooses his words carefully, but is firm about the drivers' convictions.\n\"Things have gone a little bit out of hand in the recent months with some of the things that have been going on,\" he says, adding that he feels the FIA's stance is \"unnecessary\".\n\"Not only we're racing drivers,\" he says, \"we're personalities, and if you are the individual who wants to swear as much as you like, that has a certain impact on your brand and your perception regardless of the FIA getting involved.\n\"There's times and a place. You have to ensure that our emotions stay real and true, especially when it comes to the (in-car) radio, and potentially an interview straight after the race. That's what's so pure about it.\n\"If you're talking on a Thursday afternoon in front of a number of people, maybe swearing is not really necessary or required. But when it comes to that raw emotion, you need to let us be as authentic as possible.\"\nAntonelli ready for 'big responsibility' of replacing Hamilton\nWho are the rookies joining the F1 grid in 2025? \nWho will win F1 drivers' title?

But it has been nurtured by the time he spent at Mercedes as team-mate to Lewis Hamilton.Last year, Russell became the first driver in Hamilton's 18-year career to comprehensively beat the seven-time champion in qualifying over a full season. \"And if I keep delivering those results, as I did over these last three years against the best driver of all time, I believe I will get myself in the fight and hopefully a world championship to my name. \"Mercedes won four races last year - two each for Russell and Hamilton - and have come into 2025 hoping for a car with more rounded abilities that can be competitive everywhere, rather than only on certain tracks and in certain conditions, as last year.",

        "article_text": "The family of an Indian man who was shot dead while illegally crossing into Israel say he was a victim of a job scam.\nThomas Gabriel Perera was killed by Jordanian security forces by the border with Israel on 10 February.\nHe was lured to Jordan by the promise of a lucrative job, and when it did not materialise he tried to enter Israel as he was told he could find work there, his family told the BBC. \nReports of Indians falling for employment scams and illegally entering other countries to look for work have become increasingly common.\nPerera, 47, had been accompanied by his brother-in-law Edison Charlas, who was injured in the incident. Mr Charlas was treated in hospital and spent a fortnight in prison before he was repatriated to India.\nThe two men were from the southern Indian state of Kerala where they worked as auto-rickshaw drivers.\nAn agent had promised them they could get blue-collar jobs in Jordan earning 350,000 rupees ($4,000; \u00a33,110) a month.\nMr Charlas told the BBC he paid 210,000 rupees to an agent before they left India, and paid an additional $600 after reaching Jordan on a tourist visa.\nBut when the two men arrived in Jordan's capital city Amman in early February, they were told by the agent that there were no jobs available. \nThe agent then suggested they should try illegally crossing into Israel, claiming there were plenty of opportunities there.\nOn 10 February, Mr Charlas and Perera joined a group that drove for hours to Jordan's border with Israel.\n\"We were taken in a car. It was a long distance. We got into the car at 2pm and reached the location only around midnight. Then we were made to walk several kilometres along a coastline. It was while walking in the dark that we were shot,'' said Mr Charlas.\nThe BBC has seen a letter sent to Perera's family by the Indian embassy in Jordan. It states that \"security forces tried to stop them but they did not listen to the warning, the guards opened fire on them\".\n\"One bullet hit Mr Thomas [Perera] in his head and he passed away on the spot.''\nMr Charlas, however, disputed this account and said there was \"no such warning (from the guards). They just shot.''\n\"I was walking slowly behind the others in the dark... That was when the bullet hit me and I lost consciousness. I had no clue what happened to Thomas,'' he said.\nThe BBC has asked India's foreign ministry and Jordanian authorities for comment on Mr Charlas' allegation.\nMr Charlas said he was later taken to a hospital for treatment and then moved between several Jordanian government offices before being transferred to prison, where he was kept for 18 days.\nWhile in prison, he managed to contact his wife and told her what had happened, and his wife contacted Indian embassy officials.\nMr Charlas was deported to India on 28 February. \nPerera's body is still in Jordan. In response to BBC queries, India's foreign ministry said they were working to bring the body back to India as soon as possible.\n\"I am told that it will take one or two days for the process of documentation and other things to be completed,\" said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the foreign ministry.\nOn Monday, Shashi Tharoor, the member of parliament representing Perera's constituency Thiruvananthapuram, said that members of the Indian embassy in Jordan had verified the victim's identity and that the process of transportation of the body had begun. \nDespite numerous government warnings, many Indians are still falling prey to job scams and taking the risk of entering countries illegally to find work, say observers.\n\"The modus operandi is to get a tourist visa for one country and then enter the neighbouring country,\" said Ajith Kolassery, the CEO of Norka, the Kerala government's department overseeing migration.\n\"No country will accept illegal entry. We have been consistently issuing advisories to people to be wary of job rackets, but they are still going.\"\nIn recent years hundreds of Indians have been rescued from scam centres in Cambodia and other parts of South East Asia. They were trafficked to the centres after they were lured overseas by promises of good jobs. \nScores of Indian nationals were also tricked into fighting for Russia in the war with Ukraine after they were offered fake jobs and opportunities to study abroad.\nThe 100 Indians who were deported from the US last month after being accused of entering the country illegally had also been lured by the hope of a better life, pointed out Irudaya Rajan, who chairs the International Institute of Migration and Development in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\"They also paid money to agents and were cheated. It's the struggle to get better wages [that is driving this],\" he said.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

'Weird and wonderful'Kirsty Tullett-Jones, director of Art of London, which helped organise the event, said: \"It's a wild and imaginative experience. \"I'm beyond excited that everyone can now be part of it, engage their radical imagination and question what other futures could be like.",

I completely agree with you on that,\" Newsom told conservative figure Charlie Kirk. \"It is an issue of fairness, it's deeply unfair. We've got to own that. We've got to acknowledge it.\" \nNewsom's change of tone comes amid a debate within his party over the extent to which cultural factors played a role in their resounding defeat in November, when Republicans won the White House and both chambers of Congress.\nA number of Democrats quickly denounced the governor's comments. \n\"We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks,\" a statement from California's LGBT legislative caucus read.  \nOn the debut episode of the governor's podcast, This is Gavin Newsom, his first guest was a pro-Trump activist whose Turning Point USA organisation advocates for conservative ideas on liberal-leaning college campuses. \nThe two discussed why Democratic nominee Kamala Harris lost to President Donald Trump, and Newsom said his party was being politically \"crushed\" on transgender issues.\nThe governor referred to a viral Trump campaign ad that had the tagline: \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\n\"It was devastating,\" Newsom said. \"And she didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating.\"\nKirk argued that Democrats were out of touch with everyday Americans because of broad support within the party for transgender athletes competing in sports, which he said was unfair. \n\"I revere sports,\" said Newsom. \"So, the issue of fairness is completely legit.\"\nThe governor added: \"The way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well.\"\nFormer Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called Newsom's remarks about trans athletes \"disgusting\".\nPramila Jayapal, a left-wing Democrat representing a district in the north-western state of Washington, told Politico that her party should not \"take the bait and give into their anti-trans people rhetoric\". \nBut one moderate Democratic lawmaker agreed. \nSeth Moulton, of Massachusetts, told Politico that Newsom was correct and polling shows it. \n\"More and more are willing to say what they've probably always thought - and that's a good thing,\" he said. \nAccording to an opinion survey in January by the New York Times/Ipsos, almost all Republicans and nearly seven in 10 Democrats oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women's sports.\nThroughout his career, Newsom has positioned himself to the left of his party on LGBT rights.\nHe made headlines in 2004 as San Francisco mayor when he ordered the city clerk to issue same-sex marriage licences, which at the time wasn't allowed under state or federal law. \nNewsom made the state the first sanctuary for transgender youth and protected school curriculums that included LGBT history.\nLast year he signed legislation that made California the first state to bar school districts from requiring staff to notify parents if their child changed gender identity.",

I want to go on and create a great legacy,\" said Price.\nThere is uncertainty surrounding Jonas' career, though, as the fine run in the twilight of the Liverpudlian's career is halted.\nJonas - a two-weight world champion - loses for the third time in 19 pro bouts and suggested she could call time.\n\"It's something I'll look at when I go home,\" she said. \"Right now I'm going to go home and spend some time with my daughter.\"\nDubois retains title with points win against Shin\nRelive Price's classy points win over Jonas\nThe raucous atmosphere was at odds with the regal 5,272-capacity auditorium, which has hosted British boxing since 1918 and was about 80% full. \nThe crowd, split quite equally between men and women, sat in plush, cushioned seats to enjoy the theatre of boxing.\nPrice, in all black, made her ring walk first to a huge chorus of boos drowned out by Welsh folk song Yma o Hyd, which blared out of the sound system.\nThe trailblazing Jonas - the first ever British female to box at an Olympics - rather fittingly entered to Extraordinary Being by Emeli Sand\u00e9 and Beyonce's Run the World (Girls).\nIn the dressing room before the fight, trainer Joe Gallagher drilled into Jonas how to deal with Price's burst of punches, but 'Miss GB' struggled with her opponent's speed from the outset.\nJonas was backed on to the ropes in the second, felt the power of a counter left, then stumbled when caught by a right.\nPrice bounced confidently on her toes and continued to assert dominance as Jonas missed wildly. \nAs her sister, footballer Nikita Parris, watching on with some of her England team-mates, plus TV celebrities including presenters Romesh Ranganathan and Stacey Dooley, Jonas began to let her hands go in the fifth.\nThe success was short lived. A sensational right hand sent Jonas' head spinning in the seventh.\n\"You've got to throw some punches, love,\" trainer Gallagher told Jonas. It all felt a little too late as the result became increasingly inevitable.\nThose sitting in the second tier and gallery had a breathtaking bird's-eye view of the action as Jonas hit the canvas in the ninth after a slip.\nPrice continued to pick Jonas apart until the final seconds.\nJonas had not tasted defeat since 2021 before losing to Price\nPrice became Wales' first ever female world champion when she beat Jessica McCaskill last year.\nLess than a year later, she is one win away from unifying the division.

Erykah Badu called him \"the king of neo soul\".\nMore recently, Calvin Harris told BBC Radio 2 that Ayers \"just stood out, his music is amazing and just so intricate... everything just sounds so rich and warm\". \nAyers performed at Glastonbury several times; his last performance there was in 2019.\nHe also wrote and produced the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Coffy starring Pam Grier.\nAyers could play several instruments, including the flute and trumpet but he became synonymous with the vibraphone, a percussion instrument that looks similar to a xylophone but has a set of metal bars rather than wood.\nHis other hits include Running Away and Searchin', with his band Roy Ayers Ubiquity, who were also behind Everybody Loves the Sunshine. \nRoy Edward Ayers Jr was born into a musical family in Los Angeles on 10 September 1940. \nHis mum Ruby was a school teacher and piano teacher, while his dad, Roy Sr, was a parking attendant and trombonist.\nAyers began playing the piano at the age of five and went on to play several instruments and sing in the church choir before plumping for the vibraphone.\nJazz star Lionel Hampton may have had something to do with that. Ayers attended a Lionel Hampton Big Band concert when he was just five. Quite taken by Ayers's enthusiasm and delight at the performance, Hampton gifted the youngster a pair of vibe mallets. \nAyers formed his first group while at Jefferson High School, aptly named the Jefferson Combo, and later studied advanced music theory at college.\nHe became a professional musician in 1961.\nHe went on to record three albums with jazz flautist Herbie Mann before forming Roy Ayers Ubiquity and landing the hit Everybody Loves the Sunshine in 1976, from the album of the same name.\nHis last solo album, Mahogany Vibes, featuring Badu, came out in 2004.\nAyers is survived by his wife Argerie, and their children Mtume and Ayana Ayers.\nThe Facebook post on Ayers's page added: \"His family ask that you respect their privacy at this time, a celebration of Roy's life will be forthcoming.\"\n",

What was that?\"\nWilliams repeated his question and McManus, from Glasgow, can be heard starting to cry.\n\"Is this a joke?\" she said. \"For goodness sake, yes!\"\n\"Let's do it,\" said Williams. \"We'll sort out what song later.\"\nThe singer is set to perform some of his most popular songs on tour including Angels and She's the One, as well as new songs from his recent biopic.\nHe has previously performed duets with the likes of Kylie Minogue, Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift.\nBetter Man tells the story of Robbie Williams and his rise to fame - but he is portrayed by an anthropomorphic chimpanzee. \nThe film was released in December and depicts the early days of Take That as well as his struggles with drug addiction and mental health.\nMcManus told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that she assumed Williams was going to ask her for food recommendations in Edinburgh.\n\"At no point ever in my wildest dreams did I think he was about to ask me what he did,\" she said.\n\"I cried a lot after it happened. It's the enormity of being onstage in Murrayfield in front of about 70,000 people with Robbie Williams.\n\"But it's also the magnitude of the kindness. Robbie has been so incredibly kind to me on so many different occasions even though he's such a megastar.\"\nMcManus said she got to know Williams in the early 2000s after she won Pop Idol.\n\"Robbie had just done Knebworth and he was absolutely huge with a solo career,\" she said.\n\"He was getting a lot of really horrible stuff written about him in the press. As soon as Pop Idol came along, I got a lot of that as well.\n\"It was so intense at the time about how unattractive I was, about how overweight I was. He was a huge fan of reality TV and noticed that we were both getting a lot of column inches.\"\nMcManus said Williams reached out to her after her time on Pop Idol with some advice on dealing with the negativity.\nShe added: \"I cried a lot with him at the time and it never left me because he gave me some great advice and it really helped me get through that initial period.\"\nWhen asked what she would like to sing with him, McManus said: \"That man could hand me the phone book and I'd sing it for him, I don't care because it's Robbie Williams.\n\"Obviously I want to Lulu it right up - but I don't think he'll do Relight My Fire because why would he? With the back catalogue that man's got, I'm not going to ask him to whip out a Take That number.\n\"I'll give it my best shot. He knows I'm a big belter.\"\nShe told BBC Scotland that it was especially meaningful to sing in front of a Scottish crowd with someone who has been \"really important to me throughout all of my career\".\nIn 2014, McManus was invited to sing with Rod Stewart at the Hydro in Glasgow to celebrate 50 years of the Lisbon Lions - the Celtic team that won the European Cup in Portugal in 1967.\nShe also performed alongside Susan Boyle for Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to Glasgow in 2010.\nBut she added: \"To get to this point 22 years after I won the competition, this is probably the biggest thing I've been asked to do. \n\"I'm still in shock.

        "article_text": "Danny Dyer is back on the big screen with a film about a bloke trying to win back his missus.\nMarching Powder follows the story of Jack Jones (Dyer), a football hooligan who feels increasingly irrelevant.\nAfter some violent match day behaviour, Jack is arrested and given six weeks to turn his life around - or face prison. He also has to try to save his marriage.\nBut the real Danny Dyer met his partner when they were 13. They've been together more than 30 years, married for eight of them, and he likes to think he's a bit of a romantic.\nSo, what love lessons can we learn from the former EastEnders actor?\n\"I'm a snorer,\" Dyer admits.\n\"You know what, snoring is just bad luck. Me and my wife have been around a long time and we have separate beds and the reason for that is, I unfortunately roar in the night.\"\nThe 47-year-old says it's rare to have been with your partner for over 30 years at his age. \"We're bringing up grandchildren \u2013 it's a beautiful thing. My clan's getting bigger and I've become more responsible now.\n\"I feel like I've grown up slightly and become an adult.\"\n\"Listen, I think it's a bit of a myth that I've played the hard man role,\" Dyer says. \"In EastEnders, I played an alpha male that wore a pink dressing gown. I was a very sensitive soul.\"\nHe says if you look at the Marching Powder poster, it's easy to think he's playing a hard man - but his character, Jack, isn't. \"He's into football violence and he's got a lot of issues around addiction, but he's a good man.\n\"What is masculinity?\" Dyer wonders. \"When does it become toxic? It's about being a decent human being.\n\"There's nothing wrong with being masculine. But as men, we need to open up to each other and stand up to our mates and go, 'no, I'm not coming out tonight \u2013 I'm going to spend a nice evening with my wife'.\n\"Me and my wife are actually going to therapy, couples' help groups. And you know, your mates are all laughing but you go \u2013 no, no I love her.\"\nWhen it comes to his romantic playlist, Dyer loves the somewhat unlikely combo of Luther Vandross and Jeff Buckley. \n\"Everybody Here Wants You \u2013 whack that on,\" he says. And what's his best chat up line? He replies immediately.\n\"Well, I'm Danny Dyer. I don't need one. Whatever that means. Well, you know, fame and stuff, I don't think I've ever needed to use a chat up line.\n\"Obviously I've been with my missus for so long and I went through a period where I was quite desirable to women, and all of a sudden I've become desirable again, even though I'm a grandad, a balding sort of lumpy grandad.\"\nDyer says his wife has grown with him and kept him grounded. \"She's a very special human being and she's never really been fazed by my work.\"\nHe says he comes from a working class family and the Marching Powder screening was \"full of the working class lot that love our movies. And it's always great to be around real people, as I like to call them\".\n\"You know, the real people that keep this country going \u2013 the underrepresented at the moment, the underpaid, you know, people just existing at the moment,\" he says.\n\"We need more working class people in politics that know what it's like to be working class. And we need more working class people in the arts. The most creative people out there \u2013 musicians, actors, whatever, are working class people. End of it, full stop.\"\nDyer says Jack, his character in Marching Powder, is flawed but lovable.\n\"He's got no right to still be with his wife - the way he treats her, he just keeps on getting it wrong.\" \nBut he says audiences are hopefully rooting for Jack to save his marriage.\n\"To be a good patriarch is hard and every day is a lesson,\" says Dyer. \"Look after the ones around you.\"\n\"What is love?,\" Dyer asks.\n\"It's falling in love with people's flaws, that's why we stay with people, we meet people, we have a mask on that we're so perfect and then we got to the next level where you take that mask off and it's the weird, quirky stuff that you either go \u2013 see you later, you're elbowed \u2013 or, ooh, I quite like that about you.\"\nDyer says love is an interesting dynamic.\n\"We need more love in the world, by the way,\" he says. \n\"Where's all the love gone? Too much hatred and division going on.\"\nMarching Powder is out in cinemas from 7th March.",

        "article_text": "A new Bollywood film - Mrs - has once again laid bare a stark reality: even in well-educated households in India a woman's role is often confined to unpaid domestic work.\nThe protagonist, married to a gynaecologist, finds herself trapped in an endless cycle of cooking, cleaning and caregiving. Her dreams are sidelined not by force, but by relentless criticism and quiet coercion.\nWhile the film, which is a remake of the hit Malayalam movie The Great Indian Kitchen, has sparked conversation - and pushback, especially from men on social media - its themes resonate with hard data.\nA recent government survey reveals that Indian women spend over seven hours a day on unpaid domestic and caregiving work - more than twice the time men do. Data shows that women spend 289 minutes on unpaid domestic work and 137 minutes on unpaid caregiving, whereas men spend 88 minutes on chores and 75 minutes on care work.\nThey also spent less time than men doing paid work and engaging in self-care activities.\nWhat's disappointing is that the last such survey which came out six years ago had similar results. Despite the government launching campaigns to empower women,  the situation hasn't changed much.\nIndia's Time Use Surveys (TUS) track how people spend their time across various activities. Surveyors gather data nationwide by asking individuals aged six to 59 how they spent the previous day. The first TUS was released in 2019, with the second published last week.\nWhen the government released findings from the second Time Use Survey (TUS), it highlighted two key shifts: women aged 15 to 59 spent 10 minutes less on unpaid domestic work, while their participation in employment and related activities rose by just over three percentage points.\nThe survey concluded this marked a \"shift from unpaid to paid activities\" for women - a positive sign that they were spending less time on domestic chores and more time in paid employment.\nHowever, economists argue this isn't necessarily true. Even if it is, the slight drop in domestic work suggests women are still juggling paid jobs with a heavier load of unpaid work than men.\nAshwini Deshpande, an economics professor at Ashoka University, says TUS data should be analysed alongside India's Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) for a deeper understanding of how women spend their time. FLFPR measures the percentage of women aged 15 and above in the labour force.\nAccording to government data, the FLFPR grew from about 23% in 2017-2018 to 37% in 2022-2023. Prof Deshpande says that this increase is not solely due to an increase in employment opportunities for women, but has also been spurred by economic distress.\n\"Women are not waiting for their time spent on domestic chores to reduce to take up jobs. Research shows that women want to work to supplement household incomes and so they end up working 'double-shifts', doing paid work outside the home and unpaid work inside,\" Prof Deshpande says.\nIndian women aren't alone in shouldering a disproportionate share of household and caregiving work -  it's a global reality. However, the gap in time spent on domestic work is significantly wider in India.\nWhere globally women spend about 2.8 hours more than men on domestic and care work, for Indian women, this difference is closer to four hours.\nSociologists attribute this to India's deeply patriarchal society, which continues to enforce strict gender norms. Even among the educated elite, women remain confined by roles upheld and perpetuated not just by men, but also by women.\nThis rigid enforcement of gender roles doesn't just shape women's lives - it also shapes the way stories about them are received.\nSo, while Mrs struck a chord with many, it also faced sharp criticism - especially from men on social media.\nA men's rights group accused it of \"spreading toxicity\" against traditional joint families, while others dismissed its premise altogether.\nKajol Srinivasan, a Mumbai-based comedian, says the film ruffled feathers because it held up an uncomfortable mirror to society.\nShe told the BBC how her father, who quit his job at 40 to take over household duties while her mother continued working, quickly realised that housework was no easy task.\n\"The first week he was excited; he cooked different dishes and deep-cleaned the house,\" she says. \nBut then he began to find the work tedious and couldn't continue beyond a week.  \n\"My father realised that housework was not just about work, it was also an imbalance in power. The power always stays with the breadwinner; no matter how well you cook, there are no accolades,\" she says.\nShe believes that women are expected and raised to accept this lower rung of power. \n\"When Indian men talk about what they like about their wives and mothers, it often has a lot to do with how much they have sacrificed for them or how much they take care of them or the home,\" Ms Srinivasan says.\nIndia's Time Use Survey shows that social change is slow, and it may take time before women spend less on domestic work.\nIn the meantime, films like Mrs spark conversations around everyday questions many prefer to avoid - like, who's doing the dishes?

        "article_text": "Caroline Darian, the daughter of Dominique and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, is pressing charges against her father, accusing him of drugging and raping her - something he has always denied.\nLast December, Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in jail for drugging his ex-wife, Gis\u00e8le, raping her and inviting dozens of men to also abuse her over nearly a decade.\nPelicot filmed the rapes of his wife, collecting hundreds of videos he neatly catalogued on a hard disk.\nAmong them were also two photos of his daughter, in which Ms Darian, 46, says she is clearly unconscious, sleeping in an unfamiliar position and wearing underwear she doesn't recognise. \nDominique Pelicot has offered conflicting explanations for the photos, but has always denied sexually assaulting his daughter.\nMs Darian has long said the photos are proof her father also drugged and raped her.\n\"I know that he drugged me, probably for sexual abuse. But I don't have any evidence,\" she told the BBC in January, when she also talked about the shock of being shown those pictures by police for the first time. \nThe heated courtroom exchanges between Ms Darian and her father were some of the most dramatic in the 16-week trial that shocked France and the world. \"I never touched you, never,\" Pelicot pleaded to his daughter during one session. \"You are lying!\" Ms Darian shouted back.\nMs Darian has previously said she felt she was the trial's \"forgotten victim\" as, unlike in her mother's case, there was no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted upon her.\nShe told Elle France earlier this week that the charges she is pressing against her father were \"symbolic\" but \"in line with what I have said since the start: that I am a victim of chemical submission [drug-facilitated assault] but was never recognised as such\".\nShe has hired lawyer Florence Rault to represent her.\nFor many years, Ms Rault has been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s. \nOne, a young property agent known by the pseudonym Marion, was the victim of an attempted rape in 1999, to which Pelicot has admitted. \nThe other - also an estate agent in her 20s - was raped and murdered in 1991. Pelicot is currently being investigated over that case, but has always denied any involvement.\nMs Darian said she saw similarities between her and Marion. \"We look strangely alike. She is blonde, her hair is bobbed, we were born the same year... I wanted to meet her lawyer and hear all the details,\" she told Elle France.\nIn her police complaint, which was quoted by French media, Ms Rault lamented that Ms Darian had never been offered gynecological examinations nor had she been tested for the drugs Pelicot used on his wife. \nMs Rault said the investigation had only focused on Gis\u00e8le Pelicot and that her client had been treated as a \"peripheral victim\". She asked the authorities to launch a fresh \"serious and in-depth\" inquiry.\nB\u00e9atrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, told French media that Ms Darian's decision to press charges was \"unsurprising given her statements and beliefs during the Avignon trial\".\nShe also said that the prosecutors in Avignon, in south-eastern France, said there were insufficient \"objective elements\" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on his daughter.\n\nForty-nine men were sentenced in December alongside Dominque Pelicot. All were found guilty of at least one charge - rape or sexual assault - against Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. \nSeventeen initially said they would appeal the charges against them, but seven of those have since changed their minds. \nThose who decide to press ahead with their appeals will go on trial at the end of the year in N\u00eemes, southern France.\nThe first trial - which lasted from September to December 2024 - garnered worldwide attention thanks to Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",

        "article_text": "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.\nAll the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.\nThe test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.\nSuch metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.\n\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.\nThe firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.\nThe robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.\nSuch a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.\n\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.\nDeep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"\nScars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.\nIn 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.\nOpposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.\nNautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.\nMinerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.\nCurrently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.\nNo commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.\nMr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.\nHe adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.\nUnlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.\nHe also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"\nJovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.\nSome deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.\n\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"\nThe Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.\nMr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".\nThose calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.\n\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.\nThe Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.\nDutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.\nThe Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.\nClaims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.\nJeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.\nSome sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.\nMr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.\nAnn Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.\nDr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.\nAnd there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.\n\"When you delve deeper into it, and you look at which minerals actually have supply shortages, I'm not sure that adds up,\" she says.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare carmakers from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect.\nThe announcement by the White House came even as Trump continued to blast Canada for not doing enough to stop drugs from entering the US.\n\"Nothing has convinced me that it has stopped,\" Trump wrote on social media after a phone call with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about the economic disruption caused by new trade tariffs.\nNews of the relief helped to boost US shares, which closed higher after two days of declines that had wiped out gains the S&P 500 had seen since the presidential election in November.\nThe tariff exemption is for cars made in North America that comply with the continent's existing free trade agreement. \nThat deal, which was negotiated by Trump during his first term, sets out rules for how much of a car must be made in each country to qualify for duty-free treatment.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had backed a one-month exemption to the tariffs for the car industry after pleas from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which have supply chains that stretch across North America.\nThe new tariffs - which are a tax applied as goods enter the country - were poised to disrupt a third of car production in North America within a week, according to analysts at S&P Global Mobility.\nShares in Ford were up by more than 5% after the announcement, while General Motors shares rose more than 7%. Stellantis shares in the US rose more than 9%.\n\"The president is open to hearing about additional exemptions,\" Ms Leavitt added. \"He always has open dialogue and he'll always do what he believes is right for the American people.\"\nFord said in a statement the company will continue to have a \"healthy and candid dialogue with the administration\" and touted its investment of billions in the United States. \n\nGoods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated. \nThe Canadian Chamber of Commerce warned that affordability would be hurt and business relationships would suffer, despite the chances for targeted relief. \n\"We've seen this movie before. President Trump puts tariffs in place and then doles out exemptions one at a time,\" said Matthew Holmes, the organisation's chief of public policy. \"That is not how a long-lasting trade alliance is built.\" \nOntario Premier Doug Ford told Canadian media that the one-month reprieve for automakers would not alter his plans for retaliation, which have already included a halt to sales of US liquor in the province.\n\nTrump's moves, and his threats to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on countries around the world, have raised fears of a wider trade war.\nAs well as Mexico and Canada, he hit goods from China with an additional tariff on Tuesday, raising levies to at least 20% and prompting the country to retaliate against US exports, including agricultural products. \nCanada also responded with its own retaliatory import levies on US goods after Washington's 25% tariffs on its two neighbours came into effect on Tuesday, affecting items including peanut butter, oranges and wine. \nMexico also said it would respond, including with its own tariffs.\n\"I don't know where we go with this and how it ends. I just hope that it ends quickly,\" said Iowa farmer Bob Hemesath, the board president for lobby group Farmers for Free Trade, which has raised concerns about the tariffs.  \nBig retailers in the US have already warned the measures will lead to higher prices on goods such as avocados within days, while economists are forecasting economic recessions in Mexico and Canada triggered by the tariffs.\nTrump has acknowledged his moves may lead to short-term economic pain in the US, but said he wants to protect US industry and boost manufacturing.\nHe has cast the tariffs this week against goods from America's two neighbours, as well as China, as a response to the flow of migrants and fentanyl across the border.\nWriting on social media on Wednesday, Trump said he had told Trudeau that the situation was not improving. \n\"He said that it's gotten better, but I said, 'That's not good enough',\" Trump said.\nTrudeau has called called Trump's claims about drugs a \"completely bogus\" justification for tariffs on his country.\nWhite House officials have said Trump still intends to move ahead on 2 April with plans for reciprocal tariffs on other countries around the world that he sees as treating the US unfairly. \n\"There are going to be tariffs - let's be clear - but what he's thinking about is which sections of the market that maybe he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg on Wednesday.",

Watching her fights previously with the team, that's what she does. Charges in, head down and swings.

Jones has good feet, fast hands and, as a world-class fighter, she has great awareness.\nThe fairy tale will mostly be conducted behind closed doors at the gym in long days of sparring and boring repetition; Jones will need to slow down, pick her punches and react to getting hit and hit and hit.\nSwifty will insist that she \"shapes up\" well before letting her apply for a British licence to fight; the British Boxing Board will not just grant her a licence based on her glory in another sport. She will need to display the basics, learn boxing balance and simple punches - that might be frustrating for her; all crossover athletes want to run before they can walk.\nThere are only 13 active featherweights in Britain and Jones will be an excellent addition.

        "article_text": "Cyriel Dessers scored one goal, assisted another, and had two efforts disallowed against Fenerbahce\nJust short of the hour mark in Istanbul, after he had scored Rangers' first, brilliantly assisted their second, then came inches away, twice, from adding a third, Cyriel Dessers reminded you of a boxer, dancing around the ring, toying with a bewildered opponent.\nThe Fenerbahce backline were on the ropes. Their defences were down and so were their heads. They remonstrated with each other about this menace in their midst and their inability to stop him. Dessers was running amok.\nThere were many major performers on this night of nights for Rangers - all of them, quite frankly - but Dessers was one of the star turns.\nRangers folk have had a torrid relationship with him. A kind of Richard Burton-Elizabeth Taylor vibe if you are old enough to catch the drift, an on-off thing, love and hate, tempestuous, never dull.\nThe big man scored his fourth European goal of the season and delivered his fourth assist. He is on 22 goals this term now, to match the 22 he got last season. \n'Calm down, it's not over', Mourinho warns Rangers\nRangers earn stunning win over Fenerbahce\nRangers reaction, analysis & have your say\nIf you look back over Rangers' past 25 to 30 years, you'll see that Alfredo Morelos and Kris Boyd managed back-to-back 20-plus goal seasons in the top flight, but it is a pantheon with few heroes.\nThat's not a word many among the Rangers support would associate with Dessers. \nHe has spoken before about feeling written off only months into his first season at the club - last season - how his misses were more talked about than his goals and how it made him feel like the worst Rangers player ever. His description.\nOn Thursday, he looked like one of the best Rangers strikers of several decades. Classy, dangerous, resilient, he was inches away from an away European hat-trick. \nOne goal, one assist and one lovely cushioned pass to Nico Raskin before his sumptuous delivery to Vaclav Cerny for the goal that made it 3-1 was a mighty contribution from a maligned player who just keeps going no matter the doubt that rings in his ears from the stands.\nMaybe that has changed now. Or, perhaps, it is changing. Not there yet, but moving fast in the right direction. \nMaybe you could say the same about Rangers in Europe.\nThis tie isn't over, but they produced something very special in Istanbul and take a two-goal buffer to Glasgow next week. Nobody saw that coming. Absolutely nobody. \nThey were immense. Had they won by four instead of two then Jose Mourinho suggested that he could have had no complaints.\nThis was a glorious night for the 'Four Bears' - the interim coaching team of former Rangers men led by Barry Ferguson - and a continuation of the surreality that surrounds this collection of players.\nDefeats in recent weeks by Motherwell, St Mirren and Queen's Park in the Scottish Cup. A manager sacked. A support in uproar. A Glasgow rival laughing in their face, 16 points clear in the league and so far ahead on every metric that you wonder when, or if, the chasm between them will close.\nA team that struggles hopelessly when dealing with the low blocks of smaller clubs domestically - they have dropped points in 11 out of 29 league matches - and then delivers their very best stuff against better teams in European football.\nSigmund Freud could not get to the heart of this lot. He would end up on the couch himself with Carl Jung waving a fan and some smelling salts in his face.\nFrom joyless defeats at home against teams with fractions of their budget to steepling victories away against European big shots, this lays claim to be the oddest of all Rangers sides, the one that is capable of the most jaw-dropping extremes.\nThis video can not be played\n'Brilliant result but I'm not getting carried away' - Ferguson\nIs there one to rival them in the Rangers 'odditorium'? Club historians will have plenty to say on that. \nIn more recent memory, the Giovanni van Bronckhorst side of 2021-22 are worth a mention. They got to the Europa League final that season, only losing on penalties. \nThey beat the Borussia Dortmund of Mats Hummels, Raphael Guerreiro and Jude Bellingham then the RB Leipzig of Konrad Laimer, Josko Gvardiol, Dani Olmo and Dominik Szoboszlai.\nOne missed penalty in the final shootout against an Eintracht Frankfurt side later broken up and sold on for serious money was all that stopped them. \nAll of those massive nights against heavy-hitters in Europe and they had to settle for second place in the Scottish Premiership to Ange Postecoglou's new Celtic team.\nThere are big differences between that team and the Rangers of today, though. Van Bronckhorst's lot fought hard domestically, losing the league by just four points and winning the Scottish Cup.\nThey were never as far off the pace in Scotland as the current crew, and never displayed the kind of incredible turbulence that has been so pervasive this season.\nWinston Churchill described the geo-politics of the old Soviet Union as a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma - a description that could be stolen and applied to the twin personalities of this Rangers outfit.\nFenerbahce, like others before them, afforded Rangers time and space on the not unreasonable premise that a team not good enough to score against second-tier opposition in Scotland was hardly likely to cause them too many problems.\nBig mistake. Huge. They reckoned without the Jekyll and Hyde, the domestic Rangers and the European Rangers, the Rangers who have the devil's own job in breaking down defensive teams in the Premiership but who are like kids in candy stores in Europe when there is space and an ability to counter-attack.\nDessers typified the effort: strutting, lethal and head and shoulders ahead of more celebrated strikers down the other end.\nFerguson and his coaches deserve huge credit for a formation shift to three at the back, which worked well. For sending their team out with belief when those players had reason not to believe. \nAnd for delivering a massive result that sets up a pulse-quickening night at Ibrox next Thursday. Bonkers, but brilliantly so.",

The pair is made up one male beaver and one female beaver.The trust added that staff could submit possible names on behalf of a class or on behalf of a whole school.Shropshire Wildlife Trust said last month the beavers were \"settling in well\" and had been filmed grooming each otherThe government announced last week that the animals would be released more widely across England, under a licensing system overseen by Natural England.In the Shrewsbury project, it is hoped the beavers will help to maintain the nature reserve, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.SWT said in late February that the beavers were \"settling in well\" and had been filmed grooming each other, adding that this was a sign of a good relationship between the pair.Follow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

        "article_text": "Danny Dyer is back on the big screen with a film about a bloke trying to win back his missus.\nMarching Powder follows the story of Jack Jones (Dyer), a football hooligan who feels increasingly irrelevant.\nAfter some violent match day behaviour, Jack is arrested and given six weeks to turn his life around - or face prison. He also has to try to save his marriage.\nBut the real Danny Dyer met his partner when they were 13. They've been together more than 30 years, married for eight of them, and he likes to think he's a bit of a romantic.\nSo, what love lessons can we learn from the former EastEnders actor?\n\"I'm a snorer,\" Dyer admits.\n\"You know what, snoring is just bad luck. Me and my wife have been around a long time and we have separate beds and the reason for that is, I unfortunately roar in the night.\"\nThe 47-year-old says it's rare to have been with your partner for over 30 years at his age. \"We're bringing up grandchildren \u2013 it's a beautiful thing. My clan's getting bigger and I've become more responsible now.\n\"I feel like I've grown up slightly and become an adult.\"\n\"Listen, I think it's a bit of a myth that I've played the hard man role,\" Dyer says. \"In EastEnders, I played an alpha male that wore a pink dressing gown. I was a very sensitive soul.\"\nHe says if you look at the Marching Powder poster, it's easy to think he's playing a hard man - but his character, Jack, isn't. \"He's into football violence and he's got a lot of issues around addiction, but he's a good man.\n\"What is masculinity?\" Dyer wonders. \"When does it become toxic? It's about being a decent human being.\n\"There's nothing wrong with being masculine. But as men, we need to open up to each other and stand up to our mates and go, 'no, I'm not coming out tonight \u2013 I'm going to spend a nice evening with my wife'.\n\"Me and my wife are actually going to therapy, couples' help groups. And you know, your mates are all laughing but you go \u2013 no, no I love her.\"\nWhen it comes to his romantic playlist, Dyer loves the somewhat unlikely combo of Luther Vandross and Jeff Buckley. \n\"Everybody Here Wants You \u2013 whack that on,\" he says. And what's his best chat up line? He replies immediately.\n\"Well, I'm Danny Dyer. I don't need one. Whatever that means. Well, you know, fame and stuff, I don't think I've ever needed to use a chat up line.\n\"Obviously I've been with my missus for so long and I went through a period where I was quite desirable to women, and all of a sudden I've become desirable again, even though I'm a grandad, a balding sort of lumpy grandad.\"\nDyer says his wife has grown with him and kept him grounded. \"She's a very special human being and she's never really been fazed by my work.\"\nHe says he comes from a working class family and the Marching Powder screening was \"full of the working class lot that love our movies. And it's always great to be around real people, as I like to call them\".\n\"You know, the real people that keep this country going \u2013 the underrepresented at the moment, the underpaid, you know, people just existing at the moment,\" he says.\n\"We need more working class people in politics that know what it's like to be working class. And we need more working class people in the arts. The most creative people out there \u2013 musicians, actors, whatever, are working class people. End of it, full stop.\"\nDyer says Jack, his character in Marching Powder, is flawed but lovable.\n\"He's got no right to still be with his wife - the way he treats her, he just keeps on getting it wrong.\" \nBut he says audiences are hopefully rooting for Jack to save his marriage.\n\"To be a good patriarch is hard and every day is a lesson,\" says Dyer. \"Look after the ones around you.\"\n\"What is love?,\" Dyer asks.\n\"It's falling in love with people's flaws, that's why we stay with people, we meet people, we have a mask on that we're so perfect and then we got to the next level where you take that mask off and it's the weird, quirky stuff that you either go \u2013 see you later, you're elbowed \u2013 or, ooh, I quite like that about you.\"\nDyer says love is an interesting dynamic.\n\"We need more love in the world, by the way,\" he says. \n\"Where's all the love gone? Too much hatred and division going on.\"\nMarching Powder is out in cinemas from 7th March.",

        "article_text": "In announcing the decision to postpone some tariffs on Mexico for another month, US President Donald Trump was at pains to praise his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\"I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum\", he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social. \"Our relationship has been a very good one and we are working hard, together, on the border.\"\nThe comments were in stark contrast to the kind of language he has used for the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, who he continues to refer to as \"Governor Trudeau\", while calling Canada \"the 51st State\". \nThe war of words \u2013 if not yet trade \u2013 continues between Canada and the Trump administration with Prime Minister Trudeau calling the entire tariffs policy \"dumb\" and the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, calling him a \"numbskull\" in return.\nThe difference in tone between the US neighbour to the north and the one to the south could hardly be more striking.\nSome, particularly in Claudia Sheinbaum's camp, see it as evidence of her deft handling of an unpredictable leader in the White House, one who has made several bold statements of intent, only for them to be rolled back or watered down.\nCertainly, President Sheinbaum has delivered a singular message from the start: Mexicans should \"remain calm\" over Trump, she has said, insisting that \"cooler heads will prevail.\"\nIn that sense, it has been so far, so good for the Mexican leader.\nTwice, now, in two months she has managed to stave off the imposition of sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexican goods through a last-minute phone call to President Trump \u2013 even though he said there was \"no room\" for negotiation. \nIt is testament to her diplomacy that Trump seems to genuinely appreciate her tone, clarity and overall demeanour in their interactions.\nShe has refused to accept publicly that Mexico hasn't done enough on either of the main border issues on which Trump is demanding action from his neighbours: fentanyl trafficking and undocumented immigration north.\nShe began Thursday's morning press briefing by referring to new figures from the US Customs and Border Protection agency which show seizures of fentanyl have dropped to 263 kilos, their lowest levels in 3 years. It represents a 75% drop in the last six months of her presidency.\nWhen tariffs were avoided in February, Sheinbaum agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border. \nHer administration has also extradited (although they prefer the word \"expelled\") 29 drug cartel figures to the US to face trial on charges from murder to money laundering, including a top drug lord, Rafael Caro Quintero, who has been wanted by the US authorities since the mid-1980s.\nThose may well have been the measures Trump was referring to when he said the two countries were \"working hard, together\" on border security.\nFurthermore, she has often thrown the ball back in the US president's direction. \nWhere do the guns which arm the cartels come from, she asks rhetorically, openly calling for the US to do more to curb the flow of weapons south and tackle its demand for illegal drugs. The drugs may come from Latin America, she points out, but the market for their consumption is overwhelmingly in the US.\nEven when the Trump administration recently designated six Mexican cartels as \"foreign terrorist organisations\", it seemed to strengthen her hand.\nThat's because her administration is currently embroiled in a legal battle with US gun manufacturers over negligence. If US weapons-makers have allowed their products to reach terrorists rather than mere criminals, Mexico could expand its lawsuit, she said, to include a new charge of \"complicity\" with terror groups.\nAnd yet while President Sheinbaum is enjoying a strong start to her presidency \u2013 both domestically and in the eyes of the world \u2013 for her handling of Trump, it is worth stressing that these are early days in their bilateral relationship.\n\"I think she has played the hand she has been dealt pretty well\", said Mexican economist, Valeria Moy. \"I'm not sure it's time for celebration just yet. But I think she has done what she can in the face of the threat of tariffs. It makes little sense for either of side to enter into a trade war.\"\nThe key to Sheinbaum's success seems to have been in refusing to back down on unreasonable requests or matters of real importance, while similarly not appearing subservient or acquiescent to the White House's demands. \nThat is not an easy path to tread.\nOn some questions \u2013 the Gulf of Mexico being renamed by Trump as the Gulf of America, for example \u2013 she can afford to remain above the fray knowing that most people around the world are unlikely to adopt his preferred terminology. \nOn others, particularly tariffs, the stakes are considerably higher; there's a danger that the constant back-and-forth and instability on the issue could push the Mexican economy into recession.\nThe Mexican peso weakened again during this latest episode and, although Sheinbaum claims the country's economy is strong, the markets would clearly prefer a more reliable and solid relationship with the US. Mexico remains the US's biggest trading partner, after all.\nWhen I spoke to President Sheinbaum on the campaign trail last year, shortly before she made history by becoming Mexico's first woman president, she said she would have no problem working with a second Trump presidency and that she would always \"defend\" what was right for Mexicans \u2013 including the millions who reside in the US.\n\"We must always defend our country and our sovereignty,\" she told me.\nWith so much bluster between these three neighbours in recent days, it is easy to forget that the Trump presidency is still only six weeks old.\nThe new relationship with the White House has a long way to go, with the USMCA trade agreement to be renegotiated next year. But certainly, amid all the political theatre, Claudia Sheinbaum will be more pleased than Justin Trudeau with how it has started.",

        "article_text": "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star. \nJust ask Lady Gaga.\nHer rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.\nTheir appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".\nAnd as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".\nWhen she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.\nOn stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.\n\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two. \n\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"\nNow 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.\n\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"\n\nThe couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.\nIn person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.\nBut on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.\n\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.\n\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'\n\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"\nIt was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.\n\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal. \n\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"\n\nThose feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem. \nCalled (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.\nShe calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.\nMayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.\nSpeaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.\n\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.\n\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"\n\nWith that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.\nOn the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".\nIn the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.\nThere's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created. \nIt all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.\n\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.\n\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.\n\"It kind of took me down.\"\n\nHow did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?\n\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.\n\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.\n\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.\n\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"\n\nIn previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.\nMayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.\n\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.\n\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"\n\nFrom the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase. \nLast summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.\nIt was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.\n\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.\n\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.\n\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"\n\nAs an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.\nBack then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.\nOver the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.\nBut the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.\nShe puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".\n\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"\nWith an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop. \n\"I stepped away from the icon. It ends with love.\"\nTop image credit: Interscope",

        "article_text": "Forty years ago, Northern English poet Harrison published a powerful work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds. Then, when it was screened on TV in 1987, a national furore erupted.\n\"FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY\" thundered the front page of one British newspaper, condemning the \"cascade of expletives\". \"FROM BAD TO VERSE\" was the headline of another article, that quoted a Conservative Member of Parliament questioning whether the said poem \"serves any artistic purpose whatsoever\". And a group of particularly exercised MPs called for a debate in the House of Commons.\nThe furore was about a poem called V by northern English poet Tony Harrison \u2013 a work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds \u2013 which was originally published in January 1985, but really became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre when it was screened on national television in the UK two years later, in November 1987.\nIt is not often a poem becomes a hot topic of conversation among the general public. The last time it happened was four years ago when Amanda Gorman read her poem The Hill We Climb at Joe Biden's presidential inauguration, although the poet's youth and outfit excited as much comment as her verse. Before that, it was WH Auden's Funeral Blues, after it featured in the hit 1994 romcom Four Weddings and a Funeral.\u00a0\nBut if it is unusual for a poem to escape the confines of the world of literature, it's virtually unheard of for one to provoke angry newspaper headlines, and prompt politicians to demand action and members of the public to furiously call TV channels.\u00a0\nV had its origins in a visit by Harrison to Holbeck Cemetery in Beeston, Leeds, in May 1984. The cemetery stands on a hill \u2013 beneath which there are worked-out mine seams \u2013 and overlooks both Elland Road, home of Leeds United Football Club, and the University of Leeds, where Harrison, a poet and playwright, had studied Classics and Linguistics. Harrison, there to tend his parents' graves, found the cemetery strewn with beer cans and gravestones defaced by spray-painted graffiti \u2013 four-letter words, racist abuse, swastikas and a series of \"V\" letters. The nature of some of the graffiti suggested football fans were responsible.\nAt this time, unemployment was soaring, and went on to reach 11.9% later that year, a level not seen in the UK since 1971 \u2013 and not seen since. The previous year, an award-winning BBC drama, The Boys from the Blackstuff, about unemployed tarmac-layers in Liverpool, had captured the zeitgeist and made a huge impact. The Miners' Strike had started some weeks earlier. In fact, the country was deeply divided under a polarising Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher. In the vandalism and the spray-painted daubings, Harrison saw further evidence of societal division, and it gave him the idea for his poem.\nHarrison was, at this point, an established and well-respected poet, playwright and translator. He had published several volumes of verse and been the resident dramatist at the National Theatre, while his 1973 translation of Moli\u00e8re's The Misanthrope had won great acclaim.\nOn 24 January 1985, V was published in the London Review of Books.\nIt consists of 112 four-line stanzas, or quatrains, with an ABAB rhyming scheme, the same form as Thomas Gray's celebrated 18th-Century poem Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, which Harrison sought to evoke in contrast with his own work.\nThe \"V\" of the title stands for \"versus\" \u2013 which is also a pun on \"verses\" \u2013 but maybe also for \"victory\", and perhaps it is further intended to refer to the two-fingered \"V sign\" gesture considered rude in British culture.\nOne verse reads:\nThese Vs are all the versuses of life\nfrom LEEDS v. DERBY, Black/White\nand (as I've known to my cost) man v. wife, \nCommunist v. Fascist, Left v. Right.\nThe poem imagines the poet engaging in a dialogue with the person who has defaced the graves, and it features the obscenities and racist epithets used in the graffiti.\n\"We didn't need Harrison to tell us then that Britain was divided, and we don't now, but\u00a0V was a powerful articulation of those divisions and some of their causes,\" says Sandie Byrne, Professor of English at the University of Oxford.\u00a0\n\"The football supporter who, taking a shortcut through the cemetery, takes out his rage on the gravestones, is treated sympathetically, albeit with aggressive language to match his own. The Harrison figure understands the frustration of the third-generation unemployed among headstones celebrating lifelong professions.\n\"The poem's power and endurance come from its energy, the impetus of the verse and the language, its anger, and its use of the personal in the service of the political.\"\nV did not appear to cause any outrage when first printed in the London Review of Books. It was subsequently published in book form by Bloodaxe Books in November 1985 and, again, troubled neither the UK's legislature nor its newspapers.\u00a0Neil\u00a0Astley, founder of Bloodaxe Books, and still the publisher's editor and managing director, recalls that, soon after the publication of the poem as a book, \u00a0Harrison performed the entire thing in a late-night arts slot on Tyne Tees Television, which catered specifically to audiences in North East England, and \"it went out without arousing any opposition as far as I'm aware\".\nBut then in 1987, it became known that a televised version of the poem had been made for national broadcaster Channel 4, directed by celebrated theatre director Richard Eyre and featuring Harrison reading the poem along with footage of, among other things, striking miners, Holbeck Cemetery and Thatcher doing a \"victory\" sign. At that point, all hell broke loose.\nIn October, a few weeks before its broadcast, the Daily Mail reported on the \"FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY\" on its front page. The activist and anti-obscenity campaigner Mary Whitehouse called the poem a \"work of singular nastiness\". Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth, who earlier that year had attempted to introduce legislation that would make it a crime to air material that might cause \"gross offence\" to a \"reasonable person\", was another who opposed its broadcast. He officially called for a debate in the House of Commons to try to stop it. One hundred and twenty one MPs signed the proposal. Howarth later admitted he had not read the poem in full. Harrison recalled in the 2013 BBC Radio 4 documentary, Exploring V, that at the height of the furore, a reporter from the Telegraph knocked on his door. \"I said, 'Have you read the poem?'\u2019 He said,'No. I'm New'.\"\nOpposition to the TV programme came principally from right wing commentators but the Sunday Telegraph columnist and editor of the Literary Review, Auberon Waugh, whom no-one had ever mistaken for a left winger, found the poem \"well written and extremely moving\", as he wrote in his Telegraph column at the time. Ian Hislop, the editor of UK satirical magazine Private Eye, wrote an article defending it in The Listener, as did Bernard Levin in the Times, calling it \"powerful, profound and haunting\". And the Independent printed the whole poem in its news pages, with an introduction by Blake Morrison in which he wrote: \"Those MPs are right to believe that the poem is shocking but not because of its language. It shocks because it describes unflinchingly what is meant by a divided society, because it takes the abstractions we have learned to live with \u2013 unemployment, racial tension, inequality, deprivation \u2013\u00a0and gives them a kind of physical existence on the page.\"\nThe film was broadcast at 11pm on Channel 4 on Wednesday 4 November 1987. According to the logs of the Channel 4 staff on the switchboard \u2013 which were reproduced in the appendix of Bloodaxe's second edition of the poem, along with many of the newspaper and magazine articles about the furore \u2013 there were several calls from viewers irate at the \"disgusting language\". But others approved. Mr K of Watford suggested \"politicians should address their energies into the social problems featured in the poem\". Mr W of London said: \"I am so moved the tears are running down my cheeks\". The majority of calls were in favour of the broadcast.\n\"The irony is, of course, that while Bloodaxe had sold a couple of thousand copies of the poem before 1987, as a result of the attacks on the Channel 4 film, V reached an audience of millions who might otherwise never have heard of it,\" Astley tells the BBC. \"And if you read the poem today, it feels every bit as vital and relevant as it was 40 years ago.\"\nSandie Byrne says: \"I remember friends reading about the poem in the press, and assuming that it was just a meretricious piece studded with swear words by a shock jock seeking attention. Others picked up that it mentioned [miners' leader] Arthur Scargill, and showed scenes of the miners' strike, and assumed that those were its only subjects. Even among those who actually read it, the poem seemed to revive ideas about appropriateness in poetic diction that one would have thought long dead.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 'obscene' book that became a bestseller\n\u2022 Why did Jane Austen's sister burn her letters?\n\u2022 40 of the most exciting books to read in 2025\n\"What was unexpected and possibly shocking about\u00a0V,\" Byrne tells the BBC, \"was less the dialogue that represented a young football supporter swearing \u2013 what a surprise \u2013 and more the use of iambic pentameter quatrains, at a time when closely patterned, regular verse was regarded as outmoded, an unfitting vehicle for modern concerns. The transplantation of Gray's elegy from a small country churchyard to a large urban cemetery, the use of ellipses, slang, ordinary speech and Northern pronunciation perhaps suggested that poetry wasn't a sleepy dusty backwater, or necessarily couched in prissy, posh Southern or elaborate language.\"\nThe poem was once again broadcast in its entirety on Radio 4 in 2013. Although the press anticipated controversy, there was actually little fuss. Perhaps listeners had become more used to four-letter words being used in all sorts of media. The racist epithets would have if anything, been considered even more offensive in 2013 than when the Channel 4 film was broadcast. The half-hour Radio 4 documentary that was aired before the reading of the poem that contextualised the swear words and slurs must have helped listeners understand their use in the work.\nBoth poet and poem are now an accepted part of the literary canon. The website of the Poetry Foundation, a well-respected US organisation set up to promote poetry, describes Harrison as \"Britain's leading poet-playwright\", and says that V remains his \"most famous poem\". But while V's power to shock may have been somewhat diminished, it has lost none of its ability to engage and move the reader.\nThe full text of Tony Harrison\u2019s V can be read on the London Review of Books website. Warning: it contains swear words and highly offensive racial slurs\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Right.The poem imagines the poet engaging in a dialogue with the person who has defaced the graves, and it features the obscenities and racist epithets used in the graffiti.",

        "article_text": "Men's Six Nations: Ireland v France\nVenue: Aviva Stadium, Dublin Date: Saturday, 8 March Kick-off: 14:15 GMT\nCoverage: Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, Radio Ulster & BBC Sounds; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1\nPeruse Ireland and France's line-ups for Saturday's potential Six Nations title decider and you'll find no shortage of instantly compelling head-to-head battles. \nCaelan Doris v Gregory Alldritt pits two of the world's best number eights against one another, Andrew Porter v Uini Atonio will be an engrossing scrum-time tussle, while powerhouse Irish centre Bundee Aki will meet his match in Yoram Moefana. \nBut naturally, most eyes are drawn to the battle of the scrum-halves. \nIn Antoine Dupont, France have a generational talent. A world player of the year in both the 15s and sevens codes, an Olympic gold medallist and a poster boy for his sport, Dupont has gleefully exhausted superlatives in recent years. \nHis otherworldly gifts even moved his Toulouse team-mates to refer to him as 'the Martian', Emmanuel Meafou revealed last year.\nDupont's worthy adversary on Saturday is Jamison Gibson-Park. 'Jamo' to his team-mates, he is Ireland's unflappable metronome and the frontrunner to wear nine for the British and Irish Lions in Australia this summer.\n\"Yeah, it will be interesting,\" said Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby.\n\"Two fabulous players at the peak of their game. There are a number of individual battles across the teams, but that one will be pretty special.\"\nThis will not be the first time Gibson-Park and Dupont have crossed paths, of course. They have twice met in the Champions Cup, including last year's final when Dupont's Toulouse beat Gibson-Park's Leinster in extra time.  \nThey have met three times in the Six Nations, although not since 2022 (Gibson-Park was injured in 2023 while Dupont skipped last year's championship). \nThis time, the stakes are suitably sky-high.\nSix Nations: Ireland v France preview, coverage & stats\nDupont plays down Henry visit before Ireland game\nWinning 50th cap 'an incredible honour' - Bealham\nThis video can not be played\nIs Dupont the 'best player to ever play the game'?\nThis is a hugely important game for 28-year-old Dupont and France. For a player regarded by some as the greatest of all time, a single Six Nations title - in 2022 - is an underwhelming return. \nHe does not lack emotional ammunition heading to Dublin. In 2023, not even his herculean try-saving tackle on Mack Hansen could stop Ireland's charge to the Grand Slam. \nLater that year, France's home World Cup campaign ended in the quarter-finals. With his Olympic debut on the horizon, Dupont sat out last year's Six Nations as Les Bleus again finished second to the Irish. He led Toulouse to the Champions Cup in May, but craves more silverware at Test level.\nConsidering his Top 14 commitments are likely to rule him out of facing the All Blacks in the summer, the next couple of weeks takes on even greater significance as he leads France's bid to shift the Six Nations balance of power back to Paris. \nReassuringly for France head coach Fabien Galthie, Dupont has shone since his sevens sojourn. \nIn his first game back for Toulouse, in October, he scored a 13-minute hat-trick against Clermont. On his Test return, he captained his country to an unbeaten autumn campaign, which included a 30-29 win over New Zealand. \nFresh from scoring four tries in as many Champions Cup pool games for Toulouse, he sparkled on his Six Nations return.\nDupont's assist for Theo Attissogbe's try launched a 43-0 rout over Wales, his dead-eyed cross-kick encapsulating the decision-making and accuracy that helps set him apart.\nHe did, however, endure a rare off-night in the defeat by England. He was well shackled by the home side's defence and was not immune to the handling errors that derailed the French cause, dropping a Thomas Ramos pass when an opening try seemed a certainty.\nBut as the greats often do, he bounced back, masterfully orchestrating a French attack that scored 11 tries against Italy in Rome. \nHe even bagged himself a couple, his first Six Nations tries since the Grand Slam-clinching win over England in 2022. \nFrance missed Dupont last year, but he has been at the centre of this year's title bid, his eight direct try involvements (two tries, six assists) bettered only by his team-mate Louis Bielle-Biarrey (four tries, five assists). \nSignificantly, Romain Ntamack returns from suspension to partner Toulouse team-mate Dupont at half-back in Dublin. They started all five games of France's 2022 Grand Slam triumph together, but only one since the 2023 World Cup because of Ntamack's injuries and Dupont's sevens commitments.\nWhile Dupont is a global superstar, Gibson-Park prefers to stay away from the spotlight. Unfortunately for him, he is too good to remain in the background.  \nIt hasn't always been this way.\nAfter giving up on representing New Zealand, Gibson-Park moved to Leinster from the Hurricanes in 2016. He qualified for Ireland under the residency rule in 2019 but was left out of Joe Schmidt's World Cup squad. \nHe had to bide his time at Leinster, too, behind Luke McGrath, who started the 2018 and 2019 Champions Cup finals.\nIreland coach Andy Farrell, however, recognised his potential, handing him his Test debut in October 2020. \nHe shone in the autumn wins over Japan and New Zealand a year later, broke up Ireland's iconic Johnny Sexton-Conor Murray partnership and has not looked back, rarely being overlooked when fit.\nThis video can not be played\nZidane, pranks and surfing on a trophy - life as rugby's GOAT\nHaving missed last summer's Test series in South Africa through injury, Gibson-Park has elevated his game. In November's defeat by New Zealand, he was one of a select few in green who showed up, and was key in the victories over Argentina and Australia.\nHe has been even better in the Six Nations, delivering a series of game-changing moments for Ireland in recent weeks. \nIn his player-of-the-match display against England, he scored a crucial try to jolt Ireland out of a sluggish start, brilliantly side-stepping Freddie Steward after James Lowe had shrugged off Alex Mitchell. \nHe was arguably even better as Ireland powered past Scotland in Murrayfield. \nHis superb, try-saving tackle on Blair Kinghorn - after sprinting more than half the length of the field - demonstrated his defensive awareness, speed and ability to read the play as he stopped the hosts cutting Ireland's lead to two points.\nIn Cardiff - where he again won player of the match - he showed how his kicking helps Ireland open teams up. With Ireland trailing Wales 18-13 in the second half, it was his pinpoint cross-kick that allowed Lowe to palm the ball into Jamie Osborne's path for a crucial try.\nAlongside Lowe and Sam Prendergast, Gibson-Park has been at the forefront of Ireland's ramped-up kicking game this year. He recently said he \"couldn't kick snow off a rope\" when he arrived at Leinster in 2016, so he has turned weakness into strength.\nDupont came out on top when he last faced Gibson-Park in the 2024 Investec Champions Cup final \nGibson-Park is softly spoken in front of the media but his leadership should not be overlooked, either. \nAfter Sexton's retirement, he has helped guide untested fly-halves Jack Crowley and Prendergast through their debut Six Nations campaigns.  \nTo win in Dublin and take control of the championship, both sides need every facet operating with optimum efficiency. \nBut much will hinge on how the nines fare. Considering what they have produced in recent weeks, they are poised to take centre stage on Saturday. \nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders",

        "article_text": "The pros and cons of daylight saving sparks debate around the world. Here's why some places have opted out.\nOver the last decade, countries and states around the world have abolished the practice of daylight saving time for various reasons, while other locations still cling to the practice despite health experts saying it is damaging.\nSeasonal clock shifts involve \"springing\" the clock forwards one hour in the spring to be on daylight savings time and \"falling\" backwards one hour in autumn to be on standard time. According to a 2023 analysis by Pew Research Center, half of countries globally previously observed these clock changes. Now, only about one third maintain the custom.\nThe bulk of the United States, most of Europe, and parts of Canada, Australia, Latin America, Brazil and the Caribbean have remained holdouts and still adjust their clocks. But plenty of places around the world have opted out of it entirely. These include all of Asia, and most of Africa. Over the past 10 years, Azerbaijan, Iran, Jordan, Namibia, Russia, Samoa, Syria, Turkey, Uruguay and most of Mexico have all ended the practice, according to the Pew Research Center. In the United States, Hawaii and Arizona skip the practice, as do American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\nIn December 2024, Donald Trump indicated that he wanted to end daylight saving time in the US, describing it as\u00a0\"inconvenient\" and \"very costly\", but when asked in March 2025 about the issue, the US president took a step back, saying it was a \"50-50 issue\".\nBut why do some people want to abolish daylight savings? Experts cite safety, health, and climate issues as reasons why daylight saving shifts should be abolished.\nJagdish Khubchandani, professor of public health at New Mexico State University, shares that some research has indicated a correlation between clock shifts and health problems ranging from sleep disruptions to heart attacks.\n\"Other studies and experts have also discussed accidents, mental health, well-being, etc,\" he adds. That said, \"one could easily argue that these are short-term effects of transitions and more long-term studies are needed\", he concludes.\nTime shifts, such as those related to daylight saving, disrupt\u00a0circadian rhythms, also known as the sleep-wake cycle. Disruption has been shown to\u00a0increase disease severity.\n\"The most important synchronizer of our circadian rhythms is the daylight, which helps all our body clocks to stay in sync,\" says\u00a0Tord Wingren, an engineer who studies sleep and light exposure. Wingren does own a company that sells natural lighting alternatives; however, he is\u00a0advocating for the change to abolish daylight saving time so that people would have access to natural morning light without these product aids.\nExposure to\u00a0light\u00a0in the morning\u00a0cues\u00a0one's circadian-rhythm. Tissues throughout the body have peripheral clocks that sync, based on these cues, to our master body clock in the brain. That master clock, in response to light exposure via the eyes, is responsible for kicking off a cascade of\u00a0hormonal processes. The hormones affected include those related to stress, blood sugar management, and hunger and satisfaction signalling.\u00a0\n\"Clock shifting can deprive working individuals [and] school-going populations from this boost, as they may have to start their day in darker times,\" Khubchandani says.\nExposure to darkness is a good thing at night, when it helps the body produce\u00a0melatonin, a hormone that prepares the body for sleep. But thanks to clock shifts, \"the extra light during evenings may delay our sleeping times [and] routines\", Khubchandani explains.\nResearchers from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine wrote a 2020 position\u00a0statement\u00a0in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine noting that springing forwards is indeed harmful.\nThe AASP researchers use \"social jet lag\" as a term to describe the chronic misalignment between one's natural sleep-wake cycle and life's demands from work, school and family, noting that daylight saving directly causes that social jet lag. It can be even worse in the western-most areas of a time zone. Social jet lag is\u00a0associated\u00a0with obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and depression.\n\"It is, therefore, the position of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that these seasonal time changes should be abolished in favour of a fixed, national, year-round standard time,\" the researchers\u00a0write.\nDaylight savings time practices have been\u00a0linked\u00a0to increases in\u00a0deadly traffic accidents,\u00a0workplace injuries,\u00a0medical errors\u00a0and overall\u00a0mortality.\nIn 2018, researchers in Spain penned a letter that was published in the journal Epidemiology regarding a link between\u00a0deadly car accidents\u00a0and daylight savings shifts. After collecting data from cities in Spain between 1990 and 2014, the researchers found a\u00a030%\u00a0increase in fatal traffic accidents on the day clocks sprang forwards. On the day clocks fell backwards, they saw an increase of 16%.\nAn older study from 2009, published in the Journal of Applied Psychology used data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to see if daylight saving was associated with more workplace injuries. They found a nearly\u00a06%\u00a0increase in injuries on the Monday after clocks sprang forward.\u00a0\nIn a 2021 observational study, researchers from the Mayo Clinic in the United States looked at whether daylight saving time\u00a0increased the risk of medical errors. They examined data from voluntarily reported safety-related incidents from facilities in the United States occurring from 2010 to 2017. They then refined the data by looking at instances likely stemming from human error that occurred in the week prior to and the week after daylight savings clock shifts.\nOverall, they found an almost\u00a019%\u00a0increase in safety-related incidents in the seven days after clocks sprang forwards and an almost\u00a05%\u00a0increase in the seven days after clocks fell back. The study authors attribute the increase to an average of nearly 40 minutes less of sleep for workers.\nOne of the serious health concerns related to time shifts is\u00a0acute myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Researchers in Italy wrote a 2018 review published in the journal Internal Emergency Medicine investigating daylight savings' potential effects on heart health. They reviewed seven existing studies from the United States and Europe looking at more than 80,000 cases of acute myocardial infarction. They found an increase, from\u00a04% to 29%, in heart attacks after clocks sprang forwards.\nIncidence of\u00a0stroke\u00a0may also increase after a clock shift. For a 2016 study published in the journal Sleep Medicine, researchers in Finland investigated the connection. They analysed more than 3,000 hospitalizations from 2004 to 2013 that occurred in the week following seasonal clock changes. They next compared those cases to a control group of 11,000 expected hospitalizations. The findings showed that hospitalizations for ischaemic stroke, the most common type, increased by\u00a08%\u00a0in the two days following a daylight savings shift. When looking at the whole week post-shift, the increase was\u00a03%. The association was stronger for people assigned female at birth and those who were older.\n\"[Daylight savings] can potentially influence one's cardiovascular health as well as contribute to mood disturbances and disruption of cognitive performance,\" says\u00a0Nesochi Okeke-Igbokwe,\u00a0an internist in private practice.\nFor a 2017 study published in the journal Epidemiology, researchers used records from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register. They analysed nearly 200,000 hospital contacts for unipolar depression from 1995 to 2012. The findings showed an\u00a011%\u00a0increase in unipolar depressive episodes after the spring clock shift. The increase dissipated over the 10 weeks following the clock change.\nAlthough implementation dates for countries varied, the first discussions on implementation of daylight saving occurred in 1916. However, Benjamin Franklin is credited with the original concept after analysing candle consumption in 1784 and suggesting people alter their overall sleep schedules to save money on lighting costs.\nUS National Archives attribute Germany as having the earliest experience with daylight saving during World War One. Reasons for implementation involved saving on energy bills, having more daylight in the evening for leisure time, and more.\nThe research available on whether daylight savings shifts actually do save energy is limited and mixed, however. One older US report shows a potential decrease in energy use of 0.5%, while another older report shows an increase of 4% usage.\nThe state of Arizona, on the other hand, opted out of daylight savings shifts in order to save energy. It is one of the few US states that does not participate in daylight saving practices. According to Arizona State University, the state implemented daylight saving in 1967 and abolished it that same year (however, the Navajo Nation within Arizona still participates) because Arizonans found that the clock change caused a surge in energy consumption. The desert state is notably hot, and people had to run their air conditioners for longer into the evening, driving energy use and costs. As the globe heats up due to climate change, more states, provinces and countries may follow suit.\nIn 2018, the European Commission proposed an end to clock shifts. However, the European Council has not agreed on its position. The European Parliament voted in favour of adopting the change. However the Council and Parliament must reach an agreement for the change to occur.\n\"Unfortunately, it seems Sweden [is] waiting on unity within EU before acting,\" says Wingren, who resides in the country. \"There was news two to three years ago about that Sweden should stop using DST, but this was never implemented.\u201d\nIn a different take, Florida Senator Marco Rubio introduced the Sunshine Protection Act in March 2023. If passed, the bill would make daylight saving times permanent in the United States, but the proposed legislation, after passing in the Senate, has stalled in the House of Representatives.\u00a0\nIf passed in the future, the bill would mean the US would spring clocks forwards a final time and not fall back six months later. However, the delay of sunlight in the morning and the extended sunlight in the evening has health experts, such as Khubchandani, concerned.\n\"We need natural light to start our days well, with more alertness, and brighter mood (via secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters,\" he says.\nThat\u2019s why the American Academy of Sleep Medicine advocates for the opposite. \"Current evidence best supports the adoption of year-round standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology and provides distinct benefits for public health and safety,\" the organisation wrote in response to the bill.\nAnother consideration regarding time shifts is what the public thinks about the practice.\n\"Public health is of the people and for the people,\" Khubchandani explains. \"So there is a public perception related to preferences. There are not too many polls across the nation that support the practice of DST/shifting clocks.\"\nIn a Monmouth University Poll, researchers found that just about two-thirds of people in the US would prefer to nix the practice of seasonal time shifts.\nA governmental survey from British Columbia, Canada, found that 93% of respondents want to end the shifts and stay on daylight savings time permanently. The European Commission conducted a survey in 2018, and 84% of respondents were in favour of ending daylight saving time. And a YouGov survey in the UK found that 44% of Britons want to continue with it.\n* This article was originaly pubished on 08 March 2024 and was updated on 6 March 2025 to include details of Donald Trump's position.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin one million Future fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0or\u00a0Instagram.",

Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\".\nThe spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March.\nThe Treasury has blamed several global factors, including trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine for pushing up government borrowing costs. \n\"Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes,\" a government insider told the BBC.\n\"The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor's response later this month.\"\nInsiders expect \"politically painful\" new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.\nAsked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a \"huge rise in the welfare budget\" and there were \"too many\" young people not in work, education or training.\n\"There's a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and there's a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable,\" she added.\nReeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits.\nLast year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.\nSome of that is a legacy of Covid, but ministers have complained about incentives which encourage some to \"game the system\". \nPeople on universal credit must show evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.\nSteve Wright, Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said any welfare cuts \"would be an outrageous attack on the poorest and most vulnerable\".\nThe chancellor will argue she hasn't changed her plans and that the government was always going to \"fix welfare to get people back to work\" and \"make the NHS more productive\".\n\"Headroom or no headroom, the chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous, with the whole government making that argument in the coming weeks,\" an insider told the BBC.\nThis week, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on its three biggest trading partners: Canada, Mexico and China. \nTrump has indicated that the UK could avoid border taxes, but Reeves has told the BBC that even if the UK is not hit by tariffs, a global trade war would lower growth and raise inflation.\nUncertainty over the war in Ukraine also remains, with the UK deciding to boost defence spending by cutting international aid.\nIn the run-up to the Spring Statement, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden and Health Secretary Wes Streeting will also outline a significant efficiency drive within the civil service, which they hope will lead to significant headcount and cost savings.\nIt is understood that the euro area economy stagnating and lower UK productivity numbers have affected the OBR's forecast.\nBut there have also been concerns raised about the impact of Reeves's previously announced tax rises on businesses, which are set to take effect in April, on the UK economy. \nInflation, which measures the rate of price rises over time, is expected to rise in the coming months as households are hit with increases to energy, water and council tax bills.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

'Weird and wonderful'Kirsty Tullett-Jones, director of Art of London, which helped organise the event, said: \"It's a wild and imaginative experience. \"PA MediaNelly Ben Hayoun-Stepanian unveils her large inflatable cat artworkMs Hayoun-Stepanian hopes this exhibit can \"reflect the vibrancy of what London's night scene used to be\".In a highly digital age where many feel increasingly disconnected from the natural world, she said Piccadilly Un:Plugged invites Londoners to reflect on humanity's place in the universe. \"I'm beyond excited that everyone can now be part of it, engage their radical imagination and question what other futures could be like.",

        "article_text": "From speeches watched by millions to a position as her party's deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black appeared to be one of politics rising stars.\nHowever, away from the House of Commons the SNP MP was \"flailing through life\" and became ill through depression and anxiety, she has told the BBC.\nBlack believes it was only through a \"life-changing\" diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that she was able to regain control of her life.  \nThe former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her party's performance at last year's general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to \"self-inflected\" woes.   \nBlack stood down as an elected politician in 2024 after nine years, having first won her seat aged just 20.\nShe said her decision came after years in a \"toxic\" and \"bullying\" environment that was \"consuming my entire life\", with her mental health suffering badly until she was diagnosed with ADHD around 2018.   \n\"Everything was fried - my body, my mind was emotionally fried,\" she told the BBC's Scotcast podcast.\nThe interview comes ahead of the release of a new BBC documentary, Mhairi Black: Being Me Again.\nShe said: \"I couldn't go out without throwing up. I would have panic attacks everywhere I went. \n\"I didn't understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, I'm just beating myself up more, because I'm thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that can't cope with it?\"\nThe documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.\nShe describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency.     \n\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.\nFor Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.\nShe told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.\n\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"\nBlack compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.\n\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.\nHowever, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.\nShe recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.\n\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"\nBlack recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough. \nShe said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"\nElected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".\nBlack felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\". \nShe added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive. \nShe said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.\n\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"\nBlack added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.  \nForbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.\nBlack was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.\nIt came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.\nBlack had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.\nDefeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.\n\"The way it was twisted to make her out be a drunken, bigoted wee lout was one of the worst times of my life,\" recalls her father.\nIt did not hurt her at the polls though,  and she carried that bluntness into her Westminster career.\nHowever, a vulnerability was underneath the surface - at one point the documentary shows a stuffed panda bear given to her by her mum to keep her company in London.\nIn 2018 she spoke at length about the abuse she had suffered online, repeating some of the many foul-mouthed  slurs sent to her about her appearance and sexuality, including that you \"can't put lipstick on a pig\" and that she was \"too ugly to be raped\".\n\"It's difficult to describe how you can feel so alone and unsafe and under attack with nothing more than your phone sitting there,\" she reflects.\n\"I get death threats all the time but there was one in particular where the police came to my flat down in London and the house up in Scotland. \n\"It was like two in the morning and the phrase used was a 'an imminent death threat'.\n\"I don't know what I've done to make you viscerally hate me that much.\"\nSince politics she has performed a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival and spent time talking about politics on various TV shows and podcasts.\nThere does not appear to be any second guessing about her decision to stand down though, as she enjoys a walk with her dog in the new documentary.\n\"People deserve a representative that wants to be there and I don't think that's me anymore.  I've done my bit,\" she says.\n\"Doing something normal on a Tuesday, going for a walk with my wee best pal, is much better than running around Westminster.\"",

No other team comes close to that total.\nItaly, the next most kick-happy, have done so 100 times. Scotland are down at just 71.\nWhile there is a logic and pedigree to the tactic,, external the Allianz Stadium crowd are not enamoured.\nSeveral times against Scotland and France, they grumbled as Alex Mitchell or Fin Smith lined up a skywards hoof.\nYet, when both games came to the boil, the atmosphere was bubbling.\nA pair of one-point, cliff-hanger victories kept 80-odd thousand in their seats and off their feet and England in the title hunt.\nIt has become England's way.\nIncredibly their last 15 matches against Six Nations or Rugby Championship opposition have all been decided by a single-digit margin. The average winning margin across those games is a skinny 3.5 points.\nAgainst Italy, they could do without the drama.  A few more spectators making an early cut for the train station may, on this occasion, be welcome.\nEngland v Italy match preview, team news & key stats\nSix Nations permutations, fixtures, standings & coverage\nDingwall can have Rodri-like impact - Mitchell\nEngland's focus on territorial and contestable kicks mirrors the gameplan that propelled Leicester to the Premiership title under Steve Borthwick\nVictory in comfort and a bonus point in some style should be the aim.\nAgainst an opponent they have beaten in all 31 of their previous meetings, England are strong enough to take the possibility of an upset out of the visitors' hands.\nAn awkward bounce, a refereeing call, a moment of Azzurri genius - the hosts should have amassed enough points to insulate themselves against all such eventualities by the business end of the match.\nThe outcome certain, the bonus point secure; boring, but in a better way.\nEngland have benched their most exciting player in pursuit of this goal.\nMarcus Smith's name registers the highest decibels when England's team is announced before kick-off. If you ask any young fan who they are looking forward to seeing, invariably it is the Harlequins playmaker.\nHis nose for a gap, jagging step and instinctive unpredictability were England's surest sources of tries throughout the autumn.\nHis faked drop-goal and blind-side dart produced the first against South Africa. His poked kick in behind Australia's defence set up the opening score against the Wallabies. His interception and canter upfield put them ahead in the second half against New Zealand.\nEach time though, they were pyrotechnics in losing efforts.\nIn search of more sustainable scoring, England have brought in some pre-heated cohesion, installing Fin Smith at fly-half and, after a year out the side, Fraser Dingwall at inside centre.\nThey are two of five Northampton players in the backline.\nHad George Furbank been fit, Saints would surely be only one slot away from a full house.\n\"I watched the relationship between 9,10 and 12 in training this week and have an understanding with each other that doesn't take any communication,\" said head coach Steve Borthwick this week.\n\"They seem to know what each other is going to do.\"\nItaly suffered a 49-point defeat at home against France last time out\nMarcus Smith, who was told last week that he could be world class in his new full-back role, has been replaced at 15 by 32-year-old Elliot Daly.\nIt is just the latest shuffle that Borthwick, who has enviously highlighted the settled systems and experience of Ireland, France and Scotland, has made over the campaign.\nA rookie 10 has come in, the Henry Slade-Ollie Lawrence centre partnership into which he has sunk considerable game time has come out, and three different full-backs have started across four matches.\nThe latest mix needs to work, not just for the nerves of the Twickenham regulars, but for the standings spreadsheet.\nWhatever the result between Ireland and France in Dublin on Saturday, England will head into the final day as distinct outsiders for the title.\nBut, given their current negative points difference, a failure to take five points from their meeting with Italy, would stretch their odds even longer.\nThis video can not be played\n'That's the worst question I've ever heard!'\nOnce hooker Jamie George has been presented with a ceremonial cap denoting his 100th England appearance before kick-off, England will be concerned about racking up a big number of their own.\nItaly were compliant last time out, fading fast in the second half as France ran in 11 tries in a 73-24 win in Rome.\nThey might not be this week.\nLast year, they outscored England three tries to two, running them closer than ever in the Six Nations before succumbing 27-24.\nSecond row Federico Ruzza said that he and his team-mates have \"looked each other in the face\" after the France loss.\nItaly's injured wing Louis Lynagh has warned the defeat was \"an outlier\". \"It would be dangerous for England to think otherwise,\" he told Planet Rugby., external\nWith runners like Ange Capuozzo, Monty Ioane and Tomasso Menoncello, they have flair, if they can reignite their physicality.\nBut for their title hopes and their fans' belief in their progress and promises, England need to finish the fight standing among Roman wreckage.\nAre you not entertained? England will hope to have done so in a different way when Sunday's verdict is delivered.\nFrance win in Dublin to take control of Six Nations\nMarcus Smith drops to bench with Daly at 15 against Italy\nSuperpowers & genius - Italy's 'Brexoncello' take aim at England\n'Losing captaincy almost made me end England career'",

Scotland are down at just 71.While there is a logic and pedigree to the tactic,, external the Allianz Stadium crowd are not enamoured.Several times against Scotland and France, they grumbled as Alex Mitchell or Fin Smith lined up a skywards hoof.Yet, when both games came to the boil, the atmosphere was bubbling.A pair of one-point, cliff-hanger victories kept 80-odd thousand in their seats and off their feet and England in the title hunt.It has become England's way.Incredibly their last 15 matches against Six Nations or Rugby Championship opposition have all been decided by a single-digit margin. 'Once hooker Jamie George has been presented with a ceremonial cap denoting his 100th England appearance before kick-off, England will be concerned about racking up a big number of their own.Italy were compliant last time out, fading fast in the second half as France ran in 11 tries in a 73-24 win in Rome.They might not be this week.Last year, they outscored England three tries to two, running them closer than ever in the Six Nations before succumbing 27-24.Second row Federico Ruzza said that he and his team-mates have \"looked each other in the face\" after the France loss.Italy's injured wing Louis Lynagh has warned the defeat was \"an outlier\". England will hope to have done so in a different way when Sunday's verdict is delivered.Related topicsRugby UnionEnglish RugbyMore on this storyFrance win in Dublin to take control of Six NationsMarcus Smith drops to bench with Daly at 15 against ItalyPublished3 days agoSuperpowers & genius - Italy's 'Brexoncello' take aim at EnglandPublished2 days ago'Losing captaincy almost made me end England career'Published4 days ago",

        "article_text": "The 70km Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nAs I cycled along the asphalt road, the rural Japanese landscape of rolling hills merged with the sea at low tide. Rifts of sunlight gleamed dimly on the water, minutes before dusk. The small, round body of a stone-carved Jizo Bosatsu \u2013 a custodian Buddhist deity \u2013 was seated on the rocky shore, guarding people from maritime accidents. It felt like a scene from Japanese folklore.\u00a0\nOn a month-long trip to Japan last November, I was actively looking to avoid the busy cities and experience a rural slice of the country instead. This was how I came across Shimanami Kaido, a 70km-long cycling route that links the main islands of Honshu and Shikoku, weaving through six smaller islands floating in the Seto Inland Sea, a vast body of water that spreads for 400km connecting the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan.\u00a0\nFor millennia, these small, mountainous islands were only accessible by boat until the Nishi Seto Expressway was constructed for road transport in 1999. The Shimanami Kaido cycle path runs parallel to the motorway, connecting Onomichi in Honshu Island to Imabari in Shikoku Island via some of the world's longest suspension bridges. Designated as Japan's first \"National Cycling Route\" in 2019, Shimanami Kaido, webbed with fishing harbours, hillside citrus orchards and historic shrines, is often regarded as one of the world's most incredible bike journeys.\nCyclist Mei Nakamura says that the trail offers a perfect mix of rural Japan's relaxed charm with opportunities to enjoy great cuisine and fresh seafood. \"What makes the Shimanami Kaido special is that it's enjoyable for everyone,\" she explains, \"from experienced road cyclists like myself to people who usually ride city bikes.\" And the slow, peaceful rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea creates a calm and welcoming vibe. \"It's one of the things I love most about it.\"\nYet, it is more than just a cycling route that crisscrosses seaside villages. Yoshi Kubota, general manager of the boutique hotel Azumi Setoda in Ikuchijima Island\u00a0\u2013 a key stop along the way\u00a0\u2013 says that Shimanami Kaido can be a great model for addressing overtourism. Nearly 35 million tourists flocked to Japan in 2024, most of them visiting tourist sites in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. But as demand for cycle tourism grows globally, bike routes like Shimanami Kaido help bring visitors to other parts of Japan to experience a relaxing atmosphere, bucolic scenery and local culture.\n\"You can promote cycle tourism and encourage people to stay longer in smaller communities. It helps distribute visitors evenly while benefiting the local economy,\" Kubota says. \"When you interact with locals, you get the feeling of actually living there. And you experience the slow life on the islands.\"\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nWhen I arrived at the small seaport city of Onomichi to begin my journey, I could see what Kubota was talking about. On a sunny autumn day it felt as if time had lost its meaning here. Families flocked to the harbourfront to enjoy matcha ice cream, lemonade bars lined the pedestrian alleys and narrow lanes cut through the hillside town past a series of Buddhist shrines known as the Temple Walk. As I climbed up to the famous Senkoji Temple, the cityscape unravelled before me. Cargo vessels were moored to the pier. Beyond them was a chain of jungle-studded islets, bound by the sea's vastness.\nAlthough experienced cyclists can finish the entire 70km length in a few hours, I decided to cycle a 50km stretch over a single day. I was \u2013 quite ambitiously \u2013 armed with my experience as a child cyclist who leisurely pottered behind my father during his weekend rides in Sri Lanka. Luckily for me \u2013 and other beginners \u2013 Shimanamai Kaido is safe and easy to navigate, with luggage delivery services, rest spots, vending machines and bicycle repair shops along the way. The entire bike path is clearly indicated by a blue line painted on the side of the road, and is mostly car-free and flat with gradual inclines near the bridges with dedicated cycle passageways. Several companies offer bike rentals (including e-bikes), and cyclists can rent and drop off their bikes along the way.\nAlthough a bridge connects Onomichi with the neighbouring Mukaishima Island, I opted for the short ferry ride between the two. When I rolled off the ferry in Mukaishima, I set off along the blue-lined pathway and rode past along the seafront, from where I could see the distant bridges of Shimanami Kaido as ferries drifted across the water. Before long, the next-door Iwashi Island came into view and I wheeled in along the circling road to my first crossing, the 770m-long Innoshima Bridge.\nOver the next few hours, I took several detours through Innoshima Island. Although fit cyclists can ride up to Mount Shirataki along a steep, twisty road, many find it easier to tackle on foot. The observation deck, surrounded by 700 stone Buddhas, looks over the expressway that snakes past the green thicket before it joins the Innoshima bridge. Forested islands and the Inland Sea stretch off into the distance. It's said that the temple here was built by the Murakami Suigun, a maritime clan who controlled the trade in these treacherous sea routes from the 13th to 16th Centuries, and the island's Suigun Museum showcases their artefacts.\nAs I rode through Innoshima, patches of citrus groves clung to the hilly vistas, and I stopped for daifuku (Japanese rice cake) \u2013 stuffed with sweet, sour and slightly bitter local hassaku oranges \u2013 at the Hassakuya confectionery. With mild weather throughout the year and fewer typhoons, the Setouchi region (as the area surrounding the Seto Inland Sea is called) produces most of Japan's lemons. In fact, the town of Setoda on Ikuchijima Island, almost at the midpoint of Shimanami Kaido, is regarded as the origin of lemon cultivation in Japan. It's still a key production area, evident in a series of shops, restaurants and cafes that line the 600m picturesque main drag selling everything citrus-made from lemon ramen to lemon beer, tarts, cakes, juice and gelato.\nAfter a long day, I decided to stay the night at a guesthouse. But first I headed to Setoda's Kosanji Temple. Built over a span of 30 years by the steel merchant Kosanji Kozo in memory of her mother, the temple's colourful pagoda replicates architectural styles from all over Japan and a dimly lit cave illustrates a Buddhist hell. It also houses an Italian white-marble garden called Miraishin no Oka (meaning \"eternal hope for the future\") with gleaming towers. A couple of blocks away, I soaked at the town's sento (public bath) where navy-blue mosaics cover the walls with murals of the sea.\nIn recent years, Setoda, like the surrounding islands, has seen a rise in accommodations, cafes and restaurants. When I spoke to Kubota later, she told me that Shimanami Kaido has helped revive the region where most locals have left for cities for better opportunities. With new businesses cropping up, she explained that some of the island's younger people are now returning home. As locals, too, frequent these establishments, it's now \"gradually transforming the town\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Europe's 'underdog leader' in slow-travel biking\n\u2022\u00a0How the bullet train transformed Japan\n\u2022\u00a0The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews\nThe next afternoon, I set off for another 9km with the plan of returning to Setoda for one more night. The palm-lined cycle path followed the coast, from where I could see, hear and feel the rhythm of the Seto Inland Sea. As I continued, other cyclists rode past and men gathered to fish. Ferries sailed. Grandmothers rode their bikes with groceries. At Setoda Sunset Beach, families came together for a weekend picnic, their laughter filling the air.\nI cycled past a few scattered settlements as the road ascended through lemon farms towards the impressive, 1,480m Tatara Bridge with its long, fan-like cables. After traversing my third bridge of the journey, I entered the island of Omoshima, where I watched local families setting up their tents on a camping ground as I munched on onigiri (rice balls) inside a small wooden hut next to a convenience store by the sea.\nHeading back, I reached Setoda just in time for sunset. The waterfront was brimming with people catching the last light of the day. As I settled in for homemade lemonade from a nearby cafe, I thought about how cycling here helped me see a different side of Japan filled with stunning nature and the slow, idyllic atmosphere of the islands. By then, the novice cyclist in me was already planning a return trip next autumn.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly spelled Mukaishima Island.

        "article_text": "After being sealed off from the outside world for decades and experiencing a mass exodus, Albania is leaning into its culinary roots with the help of grandma chefs.\nTefta Pajenga, aged 76, is one of many pension-age TV chefs in Albania. In her nationally televised cooking show, the retired teacher instructs a younger housewife how to cook japrak\u00eb, a traditional platter of vine leaves stuffed with rice and herbs.\nJaprak\u00eb holds a special place in Albanian hearts. It's typically prepared by families together and then shared on Christian and Muslim feast days in this religiously diverse nation. Like so many dishes in this culinary crossroads, the recipe comes from elsewhere (the name derives from the Turkish word for \"leaf\", courtesy of Albania's more-than 500 years under Ottoman rule). Yet, the ingredients are all local: dill, peppers and mint from northern Albania.\nToday, Albanian grannies like Pajenga are teaching multiple generations in one of Europe's youngest-aged countries how to cook age-old dishes. That's because the Balkan nation has suffered not one, but two bouts of culinary amnesia over the past 80 years.\nFirst, from 1946 to 1991, Albania was ruled by hardline communists who effectively sealed the small, mountainous nation off from the outside world, leading Edi Rama, the nation's current prime minister, to say it was once \"the North Korea of Europe\". During this period, cookbooks were burnt, imports were prohibited, foreign travel was banned, food was collectivised and shortages were widespread. It was a recipe for disaster.\nSecond, in the violent build-up and aftermath of communism's collapse in the 1990s, 710,000 citizens \u2013 20% of the population \u2013\u00a0fled Albania from 1989 to 2001 in search of work in other countries. Over time, Pajenga said that many of these emigrants forgot their grandmothers' recipes as they adapted to new countries and cultures. Between the widespread food shortages during communism and the subsequent emigration after it, by the early 21st Century, many Albanians at home and abroad had forgotten how to prepare traditional Albanian cuisine \u2013 except for women of a certain age.\nIronically, Pajenga says that the Albania's transition to democracy compounded the problem. \"During communism, people had one fixed job from 07:00 until 15:00,\" she recalls. \"When democracy came, you needed more than one job to feed the family.\" Therefore, many of those who did recall how to prepare traditional Albanian dishes now no longer had the time to make them.\nSo, when Pajenga started her TV show in 2004, \"my audience was not for chefs but for housewives\" and also young people, \"who were lacking the knowledge or had forgotten how to make traditional cuisine\".\nAlbania's culinary culture has long reflected its status as a stepping stone between East and West. The Romans introduced grapes, olives and other modern Albanian staples when they took hold of the area in the 2nd Century BCE. Starting in the 16th Century, dishes like Arnavut ci\u011feri (Albanian liver) spread east from Albania across the Ottoman Empire, while sutlija\u0161 (rice pudding) likely arrived in Albania courtesy of the Ottomans. And after World War Two, imported dishes like ajvar (a relish made from roasted red peppers, aubergine and spices) migrated south from the northern Balkans.\nSome indigenous foods, like mishavin\u00eb\u00a0(a type of white, grainy cheese), cannot be found anywhere else. Its preparation method, in which curd is packed tightly for three months inside animal fat until it ferments into a piquant cheese, has been passed down by generations of transhumant herders in the Albanian Alps. Other age-old Albanian dishes include flia, a pancake with crepe-like layers brushed with cream, and byrek me mish, a Turkish-style borek laced with paprika.\nGjyste Bici, 67, learned centuries-old recipes at her grandmother's knee in Albania's northern Alps, where snowy winters can still cut off residents for months at a time. \"Even before communism there was little material published, so recipes were always passed from grandmothers to younger generations,\" she says.\nMany Albanian recipes have a religious root. This was frowned upon under communism, especially after 1967, when authoritarian ruler Enver Hoxha banned all religious practices.\n\"The dictatorship tried to destroy all religions,\" recalls Dallendyshe Xhahysa, a 91-year-old amateur chef who memorised Albanian recipes from her ancestors and made them through the country's near-half century of communist rule. According to Xhahysa, \"recipes used in Muslim and Christian celebrations never would have survived if it wasn't for the efforts of grandmothers like me\".\n\"We had to cook special dishes secretly during Easter or Ramadan,\" continues Xhahysa. One such dish was halva, a dense, fudge-like dessert traditionally shared on the holiest day of Ramadan, Lailat al Qadr.\n\"If you cooked halva over Ramadan, neighbours would spy on you in order to get a bonus from the state,\" Xhahysa remembers. So as not to attract attention, the ingredients were purchased weeks in advance. \"We would cook halva with the windows closed or curtains drawn\" to curtail the fragrant waft of sugar, nuts and rosewater.\nThe punishment if caught preparing a religious feast was harsh. \"We could be taken to a re-education camp for many months to be given a bad job, like cleaning a jail in a remote area,\" recalls Xhahysa, shuddering.\nExtreme food shortages led to the loss of other recipes. \"Very few people were allowed to keep animals or farm land,\" explains Bici. Only those in rural areas were allowed to work a 50-sq-m plot and keep a few chickens. \"It was forbidden to own a pig or sheep.\"\nEverything was rationed, continues Bici. \"Each month you were allowed 10kg of potatoes and 2kg of cheese per family.\"\nWithout easy access to ingredients or cookbooks, centuries-old recipes like tav\u00eb krapi (a baked carp casserole) were largely forgotten due to the prohibition of private fishing.\nWhen Albania's borders finally opened up in the 1990s and its national television networks were no longer controlled by the state, many grannies started using TV to revive the nation's long-lost culinary heritage.\nBici began cooking on the show The Albanian Sunday in 2007, showcasing recipes she says were cooked \"for thousands of years\", like lakror me arra (an Albanian pie often made with layered ricotta, nettles, leeks, lamb and nuts).\nBut while Bici and Pajenga's cooking shows were helping to revive traditional recipes, they were fighting against another tide: farmers in rural Albania were migrating to Tirana in search of work and many rural villages became ghost towns. \"Farming has still not fully recovered from what happened [in the decades after communism],\" says Pajenga.\nBici has made it her mission to ensure Albania's traditional recipes aren't forgotten a third time. The grandmother has collated age-old cooking methods in a book, Unique Cuisine of the Albanian Highlands. She also cooks mountain recipes on the TV show Histori Shqiptare (Albanian History).\n\"I have many requests from Instagram for old recipes,\" Bici says. \"If youngsters follow my recipe for lakror on TikTok, that's fine too.\"\n\u00a0Xhahysa, now a great-grandmother, is also still sharing her knowledge. She started cooking with her grandmother in the 1930s and contributed recipes to Albania's first farm-to-fork restaurant, Uka Farm, a Tirana-based wine bar and agrotourism that has inspired 100 rural farm stays across Albania.\nXhahysa's recipe of f\u00ebrges\u00eb (a baked vegetable dish with cheese) is a popular appetiser at Uka Farm. The farm's butter-fried peppers served with a big dollop of gjiz\u00eb (a ricotta-style cheese) is a taste of Albania\u2019s forgotten past.\nInspired by Pajenga, Bici and other TV-cooking grannies, a 2018 event in Tirana pairing 12 grandmothers with 12 top chefs became an instant Albanian sensation, spawning several granny-meets-millennial TV shows like Gjyshet Milionere (\"Millionaire Grandmothers\").\nThe event was hosted by one of Albania's most famous chefs, Bledar Kola, who has dedicated much of his career to championing traditional Albanian cuisine. \"Not being too cocky,\" says Kola, \"but this show started a small spark on a big fire.\"\nAfter a career working in Europe's top restaurants, including stages at Le Gavroche in London and noma in Copenhagen, Kola returned to Tirana a decade ago to present ancient Albanian recipes in a more modern way at the capital's top restaurant Mullixhiu. In the absence of cookbooks, he also picked up skills from an Albanian granny.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Peak of the Balkans Trail: Europe's last true wilderness\n\u2022 A new 5,500km bike trail connecting one of Europe's most remote regions\n\u2022 Kuk\u00ebs: The first city ever nominated for a Nobel Prize\nNow Kola is going one step further by opening a traditional restaurant in Gjirokaster, a Unesco-inscribed city in southern Albania. At the forthcoming rural restaurant Mullixhino (which is expected to open in late 2025), the focus is squarely on Albania's age-old dishes. \"The cuisine will be garden-inspired, everything cooked on an open fire, in an open kitchen,\" says Kola.\nThe restaurant's recipes are an homage to Albanian grandmothers. \"We've been meeting grandmothers for coffee to come up with a great concept,\" says Kola. \"We will serve traditional food from Albania's south, influenced by grandmothers in the region.\"\nA new foodie almanac containing 7,000 Albanian ingredients, dishes and cooking methods \u2013 many sourced from grandmothers \u2013 is also in progress and is being co-written by Kola's brother Nikolin, alongside nine academics.\nNikolin believes the book \"will raise awareness of Albanian food, like what Ren\u00e9 [Redzepi] did for Danish cooking\".\nThanks to grannies, Albanian cuisine is finally being reborn.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

His resentencing was possible under a law that allows for sentence reductions for people convicted as minors and have spent more than 20 years in prison. \nBaltimore City Circuit Judge Jennifer Schiffer made the ruling in court on Tuesday. \nSyed and Min Lee were classmates in high school in Maryland when Lee disappeared in January 1999. Her body was found in a forest three weeks later.\nSyed, then 17, was found guilty of first degree murder in February 2000, and sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors at the time alleged Syed carried out the crime after becoming jealous of Lee's new relationship after the two broke up.\nIn 2014, Syed's case gained national attention through the true-crime podcast 'Serial', which was listened to by millions of people. \nThe podcast raised questions about the evidence provided by prosecutors and witnesses that appeared at his trial, and it explored the effectiveness of Syed's attorney.\nFans of the podcast have donated more than $80,000 to Syed's legal fund, according to CBS News.\nSyed was cleared of all charges in 2022 after prosecutors said he had been wrongfully convicted.\nBut his conviction was reinstated a year later in 2023 after an appeals court found that the lower court had failed to give the victim's brother sufficient notice of the hearing that freed Syed.\nJudge Schiffer's ruling on Tuesday allows for Syed to remain free.

But following a lengthy TMO review, the try was ruled out for a knock-on.\nFrom there, the momentum shifted dramatically, and after McCarthy was yellow carded for cynically pulling back Thomas Ramos, France immediately capitalised on their numerical advantage as Dupont sent Bielle-Biarrey over for his sixth try of the tournament.\nThat would be one of Dupont's last acts, though, as a knee injury sustained in a collision with Ireland second row Tadhg Beirne forced the French captain off to be replaced by Maxime Lucu, France's solitary backline replacement after head coach Fabien Galthie opted to pack seven forwards on to his bench.\nWithin five minutes of Dupont's exit, Ireland finally got on the scoreboard through Prendergast's penalty, and while Irish obstruction straight from the kick-off enabled Ramos to respond, the Ireland out-half's dead-eyed kick from halfway cut France's lead to two at the break.\nThis video can not be played\nFrance score 'irresistible' try\nLike they did in the first half, Ireland came flying out of the traps after the restart and scored within three minutes when Sheehan touched down in the corner from a maul.\nPrendergast converted and Ireland led 13-8, but that was as good as it got for the hosts as France hit back swiftly through Boudehent. \nIreland felt Flament should have been penalised for taking out O'Mahony off the ball and their frustrations deepened when Nash was shown a yellow card for head-on-head contact with Pierre-Louis Barassi.\nFrom there, France seized control, Bielle-Biarrey racing on to his own kick to score his second at the end of another electric counter-attack. \nReplacement flanker Jegou - filling in at centre following Barassi's injury - sealed the visitors' bonus point, and while Flament was sin-binned soon after, Penaud compounded Irish misery with a signature breakaway score. \nAfter Ramos intercepted Prendergast's pass, Penaud ecstatically dove over the line as he drew level with Blanco and rubbed salt into Irish wounds. \nFrance's 42-point haul was the most they have ever scored in Dublin and with 26 tries they are just three shy of England's championship record set in 2001. \nHaving felt the full force of a ferocious French performance, Ireland did score late tries through Healy and Jack Conan. \nIt was not enough to secure a try bonus, though, on an afternoon that belonged to France and Ireland will want to soon forget. \nIreland: Keenan; Nash, Henshaw, Aki, Osborne; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Porter, Sheehan, Bealham, McCarthy, Beirne, O'Mahony, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\nReplacements: Herring, Healy, Clarkson, Ryan, Conan, Baird, Murray, Crowley.\nSin-bin: McCarthy (20), Nash (47)\nFrance: Ramos; Penaud, Barassi, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Ntamack, Dupont (capt); Gros, Mauvaka, Atonio, Flament, Guillard, Cros, Boudehent, Alldritt.\nReplacements: Marchand, Baille, Aldegheri, Meafou, Auradou, Jegou, Jelonch, Lucu.\nSin-bin: Flament (74)\nReferee: Angus Gardner (Australia)",

About 4,000 fans witnessed Lauren Price dominate trailblazer Natasha Jonas in the main event of an all-female card.\nIn the chief support, Caroline Dubois outpointed Bo Mi Re Shin in an entertaining battle. The self-assured world champion has the potential to make waves \u2013 in the ring and commercially - for years to come.\nKaren Artingsall became British champion by beating Raven Chapman in a featherweight contest that shows a gradual deepening of the depth of women's boxing, which has historically been lacking.\nOn the surface, the event - a day before International Women's Day - was a success and provides a launchpad for women's boxing in Britain to progress.\nBut we have been here before.\nFormer world champion Hannah Rankin feels women's boxing failed to capitalise on the momentum created by Savannah Marshall v Claressa Shields in October 2022, when an all-women card packed out the O2 Arena.\n\"There was a real opportunity there but when big-time boxing moved to Saudi Arabia, it slowed down the progression and whole trajectory of women's boxing,\" she says.\nSaudi Arabia continues to host high-profile men's bouts as women's boxing has generally been overlooked.\nThe trilogy between Irishwoman Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano in New York, which will be broadcast on Netflix in June, will help grow the sport globally, but what can be done to make the female sphere take centre stage in the United Kingdom?\nThis video can not be played\n'I'll remember win at Albert Hall for the rest of my life'\nPioneer of women's boxing Jane Couch, TV presenter Stacey Dooley and several female athletes packed out the majestic Kensington venue.\nThe Shields-Marshall card, albeit nearly two-and-a-half years ago, reportedly reached a peak audience of one million viewers.\n\"This might be controversial, but I'm just not a fan [of all-female cards] and I never have been,\" Scotland's Rankin says.\nShe feels mixed-gender cards rather than segregating the two codes will attract more interest.\n\"I think if promoters are smart, they will start pushing women from where they're from,\" Rankin adds.\nPrice has competed in Wales just once in nine pro bouts while London's highly talented unified super-bantamweight champion Ellie Scotney's past two fights have taken place on undercards in Manchester and Nottingham.\n\"Can Ellie be given an opportunity to sell out a smaller venue in London?\" says Rankin.\n\"If women aren't getting the opportunities in Saudi, then let us be the champions at home and bring the crowds at home to watch.\n\"They might say they're not big ticket sellers but how do you become a big ticket seller if people from your area can't come and see you?\"\nWorld champion Price cruises past Jonas to unify division\nDubois retains title with points win against Shin\nRelive Price's classy points win over Jonas\nCaroline Dubois is one of Britain's five reigning female world champions\nShields \u2013 the self-proclaimed 'Greatest Woman of All Time' - played up to the American villain role against Marshall in a fight which stemmed from an amateur rivalry.\nThere was no such animosity between Jonas and Price in a relatively subdued fight week. \n\"Boxing is 50% talent and 50% entertainment,\" Rankin says.\n\"Female fighters have to take some ownership and start promoting themselves.\n\"Go work in your community, be active on social media, speak up in press conferences \u2013 however you want to sell yourself.\"\nLondoner Dubois is one of a few female fighters beginning to showcase the art of self-promotion, though.\n\"How audacious that she thinks she can beat me?\" Dubois said at Wednesday's news conference, despite South Korean Shin saying nothing to prompt such an impassioned response.\nDubois is a \"breath of fresh air\", according to Rankin, and the 25-year-old appears to understand the importance of putting on a show - even if it might be to her detriment. \nIn the final round against Shin, Dubois took unnecessary risks and heavy hits in a bid to entertain her home crowd.\nIreland's Katie Taylor is arguably the biggest draw in female boxing but may be nearing the end of her career\nBritish title fights are a mainstay in the men's code, producing countless classics including Anthony Joshua's showdown with Dillian Whyte in 2015.\nBut they were only introduced in women's boxing in 2023, when Price beat Kirstie Bavington to become the inaugural champion.\n\"The British title can create more domestic dust-ups before we get onto the world level,\" Rankin says.\n\"For men, it's revered in every gym.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'No one wanted to give me a chance' - Gonzalez Quintero\nOn the streets they call him 'Kego'. The one-time wonderkid left to train alone in a concrete wilderness of city towerblock staircases. A cage footballer for hire, a pick-up game artist on speed dial. The embers of his professional dream still flickering in a footballing underworld.\nKevin Gonzalez Quintero was once Jude Bellingham's England room-mate, played in the same youth teams as Jamal Musiala and Harvey Elliott and was the guy a young Jhon Duran would ask for boots.\n\"Jude, he is a great lad,\" remembers Kego. \"He is very chill, a great person on and off the pitch. You can see why he is where he is today. Since that very young age he has had that leadership. Very mature.\"\nHis father once played for Deportivo Cali, but Kego's parents packed up and left a Colombia that he says was in the grip of Pablo Escobar and the nation's drug cartels to swap South America for a new life in south London before he was born.\nThat allowed Kego to shine in front of Crystal Palace scouts, joining the Eagles aged eight and later winning their academy player of the year.\nAfter a decade with Palace he believed he was destined for the Premier League and life on the international stage. As well as England, Kego represented Colombia at youth level.\n\"It was a dream,\" he says. \"I always wanted to play for Colombia. Duran was there with me. He is a funny guy.\n\"He has always been good, but he wasn't banging in goals like that. Which shows his dedication, his time. It worked out for him. I'm very happy for him, too. He deserves it, I saw how hard it was for him.\n\"I remember him asking me for football boots. Just seeing him now is like 'wow, you have grown so much and I am proud of you, man'.\"\nThose players have gone on to represent some of the world's biggest clubs - Bellingham at Real Madrid, Musiala at Bayern Munich and Elliott at Liverpool, while former Aston Villa striker Duran is making his fortune in Saudi Arabia.\nBut for Kego, it didn't work out like that. \nHe was released by Palace at 18 and, via false dawns and broken promises, spent four years travelling the world, trialling in 14 different countries, yearning for a professional contract.\n\"I thought I was going to have the world at my feet,\" says the now 22-year-old. \"I played with Colombia, I played with England. I was at Palace for 10 years. I was pretty sure I'd get a club, easily, but then I got exposed to the real world, quickly.\"\nJamal Musiala and Kego on England youth team duty\nSo what went wrong for Kego at Crystal Palace? He was offered an extension, he says, but it did not materialise. \n\"I got different advice that I shouldn't have listened to,\" recalls Kego. \"Two months later, they just told me 'Look, Kevin, we're not going to guarantee you any game time for next year, you're better off looking for other teams. You're a very good player, we believe you can start your professional career elsewhere'.\n\"I was very down, 10 years here and then just like that, gone.\n\"A few agents, they lied to me. Saying 'listen, we have got this club for you and this club'. They sell you the world. But when it came to the time, nothing happened. That was really upsetting.\"\nHe was caught in a spiral of failed trials and wasted journeys - Hungary, Spain, even Brazil.\n\"Before you know it, you're six months without a club, then a year, then it carries on going,\" adds Kego. \"They start questioning your ability. Often I heard from clubs 'Oh, but he's been out for six months, oh, two years now'.\n\"Then when I did get the chance, I would be so mentally drained, to the point I couldn't focus. And when I was there, there would be another agent telling me 'listen, I've got you a first-team game'.\n\"I went to another team in Spain. The agent sorted the travel and everything, but when I got there, he blocked me. I didn't hear from him again and I was left stranded.\"\nAt the same time, his mum became seriously ill and needed the support of Kego and his father. \n\"Seeing your mum, the person that raised you, when she's ill, that kills you as a son,\" he says. \"She is still recovering, she has days that are good and days that are bad. We are getting there.\"\nKego with Xavi Simons, now of RB Leipzig and the Netherlands, after a youth match against Barcelona\nKego with the Colombia Under-17s squad\n1 of 2\nTo stay prepared for an opportunity, Kego would train relentlessly on his own.\n\"It almost felt like a prison cell,\" he explains. \"You wake up, you train, you see the same surroundings over and over again. Four years, the same thing.\n\"I would wake up, I would see bricks, blocks. It's mad. Going from seeing grass, everything is cut for you, you have got new balls - now I am maybe playing with a flat football, playing with a tennis ball or a golf ball.\n\"It's called the towerblock in my area. Every day I would be running up the stairs, training with my dad. I would even go to the park, on an 11-a-side pitch, I would start passing the ball to imaginary team-mates and then I would go and chase after the ball myself. It wasn't easy, but you have to work with what you have.\"\nBut it was not just a physical battle. He could eat well and run until the sun came up - and friends say they would get calls at 4am to do just that - but mentally, with no end in sight, the churn was taxing.\n\"When you're not at a team you're getting frustrated because you know your talent, you know that you can do that, that you're a good player, you have played with the best before,\" says Kego. \"Mentally it is killing you.\"\nKego says he went \"deep inside my mind\". He tried new things - he practises Simran meditation and, as a Christian, studies the Bible and prays. \nBut he also found salvation on the streets, with a ball at his feet.\n\"Street football is what gives you that tempo,\" he beams. \"Short spaces. You have got to think quick. It really helped me. It gave me a lot of confidence. I was like 'you know what, if I can do it in this short space, imagine a bigger space'.\"\nKego built a reputation in cage tournaments and pick-up games, becoming renowned in street football circles and even earning a deal with Puma.\n\"Everyone knew if they wanted to win with style, call him,\" laughs Gundeep Anand, the founder of street football tournament The Last Stand.\nIt was in one such tournament Kego was spotted by Spanish side UD Ibarra, and suddenly the dream was revived.\nKego earned a glowing reputation on the street football scene, playing in tournaments such as The Last Stand \nDiego Maradona Jr is the head coach of Spanish side UD Ibarra, who play on the island of Tenerife\nIbarra, from Tenerife, play in the fifth tier but are pushing for promotion and showing ambition. They recently appointed Diego Maradona Jr as head coach.\n\"He passed the ball to me and I said 'what, wait, [it's like] his dad is passing the ball to me',\" Kego remembers of their first meeting on the training pitch. \"It's a bit mad. I was watching his dad's YouTube videos and then his son is passing the ball to me.\n\"The way they walk, they have a similar look. It's very motivating.\"\nThe forward is waiting to make his debut and Maradona Jr is keen to see the youngster kickstart his career in the Canary Islands.\n\"We needed a player like him,\" he says. \"Quick. Good technically, and had some experience in professional teams like Crystal Palace, the Colombian national team.\n\"He can bring speed to the game.  A player who can score many goals and who understands the game.\n\"We hope he can bring a different mentality that we are trying to change with the team and the club.\"\nKego describes joining Ibarra as \"relief\". Now, he says, \"it's time to shine\".\n\"I was buzzing, excited, very emotional as well,\" he adds.\n\"All these years of work, I would never have thought I would make it pro at 22. If I'm honest, I said let me just dedicate myself to playing street football.\"\nThat is one dream accomplished, but what comes next?\n\"I always think big,\" he smiles. \"Short term is smash it here, do my best, focus and try and get many goals and get the club promotion.\n\"Longer term... I want to be the best player in the world one day.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

        "article_text": "Ruth Mwandumba dreamt she was having twins before a scan confirmed that was the case\nSuccess in shooting requires steady hands, steely focus and the ability to block out all external distractions - but what about internal ones?\nFor two-time English champion Ruth Mwandumba we are not talking about feeling peckish, or a little poorly; rather pregnancy and the prospect of being kicked by not only one or two feet at a time, but potentially four, and as many arms.\n\"Twins, yeah, a massive shock,\" said the smiling GB athlete, who is competing at the European Rifle Shooting Championships while six months pregnant.\n\"It's definitely a strange one [to compete] and not a normal thing people do!\n\"I've had some rough training sessions ahead of the Europeans and some days where every shot felt like I was climbing Mount Everest because I was in so much pain and doubt was creeping into my mind.\n\"But, sometimes it's about showing up, pushing through and embracing that struggle;

\"No actually you're right, it was a nightmare!\n\"I woke up going, 'that can't be happening, it's not happening, right?'\"\nThe 29-year-old has also endured a tricky pregnancy, with nausea and vomiting extending into her second trimester.\n\"The whole pregnancy in general was a bit of a shock because I struggle quite badly with endometriosis,\" she revealed.\n\"It took four years of experiencing extreme pelvic pain, as well as really, really intense periods, before I was first officially diagnosed in 2017 and I've had two surgeries since.\"\nEndometriosis is a condition in which tissue, similar to the lining of the uterus, grows outside the uterus, and can cause infertility.\nShe had \"difficult conversations\" with healthcare providers who warned her she might not be able to conceive naturally.\n\"It was almost scary to be discussing the possibility, at the age of 22-23, that I might not be able to have kids in the future.\n\"So, to have had those conversations and then all of a sudden be expecting twins, never mind just one, was a huge shock,\" said Mwandumba, who thought she might need IVF but ultimately did not require it.\n\"I think it's great to show it's not all doom-and-gloom and despite the negative experiences you can still get a beautiful experience at the end.\"\nUK Sport recently released enhanced pregnancy guidance, pledging to \"increase and improve support\" for female athletes.\nMwandumba's British team-mate Amber Rutter was one of the first to receive this additional assistance in the lead up to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where she ultimately won silver, three months after becoming a mother.\n\"British Shooting have been so supportive from the beginning and I think the experience with Amber before the Olympics means they can use a lot of the same support and resources,\" said Mwandumba, who was a travelling reserve for the Paris 2024 Games.\nWhile optimistic about the future, one area of concern is becoming a parent and bringing black children into the world.\nThe shooter, who has Malawian heritage, has been a prominent figure in the push for greater diversity in the sport, launching the #TargetChange initiative in 2022, while she has also previously spoken about her own concerns around racism in the UK.\n\"I think we're still very much in a scary world, and it definitely is something that scares me,\" she said.\n\"Change might be slow, but it is happening and I'll always be open with them about how they might be viewed or how they might approach certain situations, but hopefully by the time they are teenagers, things will be a bit different.\"\nWell before her children reach their teen years though, Mwandumba is hoping to not only return to the sport, but become an Olympian.\nShe was the reserve to Seonaid McIntosh in the 10m air rifle event at the 2024 Games and has set her sights on the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\n\"Once upon a time, I felt as though pregnancy within elite sport automatically meant retirement, and obviously we're at a point now where that's not the case,\" said Mwandumba.\n\"So many people have been successful at their sport, gotten pregnant, had a family, then come back and have still managed to be just as successful, if not more so and I think that's so inspiring to those of us who are going through the journey.\n\"It's definitely motivated me to because my plan is to come back and still hopefully aim for those major competitions, with the Olympics the long-term goal.\n\"To do it with my twins watching on, would be all the more special.\"",

        "article_text": "Florida has launched a criminal investigation into controversial British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate. \nAt the end of February, the brothers flew to the US from Romania, where they face rape and human-trafficking charges - which they deny.\nAndrew Tate, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, are dual US-UK citizens who claim to have made millions from their social media empire.\nTheir online output was controversial even before their legal troubles, with the pair attracting frequent criticism over offensive statements about women.\nThe pair have an American father who worked for the US Air Force in Britain. Their parents met in the UK before moving to the US.\nAfter their parents divorced, their mother moved to Luton, England. The brothers spent time in the UK, where they built their early careers.\nPolice in the UK have linked Andrew Tate to the \"quite terrifying\" radicalisation of boys and young men in a 2024 report into violence against women and girls.\nThe brothers were first arrested in Romania in 2022. They are facing separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK. Both brothers also deny the charges against them in the UK.\nThe brothers had been under a travel ban in Romania for more than two years while they were under investigation.\nSpeculation that they would leave Romania had been mounting ahead of their journey, after the pair went quiet on social media.\nThey flew from Bucharest to Florida on a private jet on 27 February.\nProsecutors said the travel ban had been lifted, and the pair's US passports had been returned to them, but investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. \nThe Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right.\nEarlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed.\nIt came after US special envoy Richard Grenell raised the Tate brothers with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at the Munich Security Conference.\nHurezeanu said he had not considered Grenell's approach as a \"form of pressure\". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident.\nThe Tates have been vocal supporters of US President Donald Trump, while Trump's close adviser, Elon Musk, restored Andrew Tate's account on X after he bought the social media platform in 2022.\nIn the US, the brothers are facing a civil lawsuit from a women who alleges they coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They strongly deny the allegations.\nIn a statement issued on 4 March, Florida's attorney general, James Uthmeier, said that he had directed his office and law enforcement partners \"to conduct a preliminary inquiry into Andrew and Tristan Tate\".\nHe added: \"Based on a thorough review of the evidence, I've directed the Office of Statewide Prosecution to execute search warrants and issue subpoenas in the now-active criminal investigation into the Tate brothers.\"\nIn response, a statement from the Tate brothers' lawyer Joseph McBride called Uthmeier's comments \"inflammatory\" and \"biased\".\n\"He publicly took a side in an ongoing Florida lawsuit where Andrew and Tristan Tate are suing a Florida woman for orchestrating a sophisticated plot to use sex as a weapon to ruin their lives,\" he added.\nThe cases against the Tate brothers in Romania are now being rewritten by prosecutors, who allowed them to leave the country on the condition that they return - possibly as early as the end of March.\nThe pair's request to leave the country was accepted, prosecutors said, but their request for the charges against them to be dropped was rejected.\nThe brothers face a number of civil and criminal legal cases.\nThey are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They deny the charges.\nThey face separate, unrelated charges of rape and human trafficking in the UK, which they also deny. In March 2024, a Romanian court ruled they could be extradited to the UK after their case in Romania concluded.\nSeparately, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Andrew Tate said they were bringing a civil case at the High Court in the UK for \"damages for injuries they suffered as a result\".\nA representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they \"unequivocally deny all allegations\".\nA separate civil case in the UK, which the brothers are contesting, accuses the brothers and a third individual of being serial tax evaders.\nThe brothers have had their properties, vehicles, bank accounts and company shares returned to them by the Romanian authorities, a spokesperson for the brothers said.\nA Ferrari, a Mercedes-Benz, and an Audi A5 were among the vehicles released, the spokesperson said.\nThe assets, which were seized by the authorities in the wake of the brothers' detention in 2022, were released following a court appeal led by their lawyer Eugen Vidineac.\nSome of their assets \"remain under precautionary seizure\", the spokesperson said, but described the ruling as a \"significant step toward justice.\"\nFour women who allege they were sexually abused by Andrew Tate said they were in \"disbelief and feel re-traumatised\" by his departure from Romania.\nIn a joint statement, the four said: \"It is clear that he will now not face criminal prosecution for his alleged crimes in Romania; he will use it as an opportunity to harass further and intimidate witnesses and his accusers, and he will continue to spread his violent, misogynistic doctrine around the world.\"\nThey also urged British authorities to \"finally take action, do something about this terrifying unfolding situation and ensure he faces justice in the UK\".\nMatthew Jury, a lawyer representing the four alleged victims, told the BBC the Trump administration was \"interfering in due process\" in Romania and the UK.\nHe added he didn't think the Tate brothers would \"ever face justice in Romania now\".",

I just hope that it ends quickly,\" said Iowa farmer Bob Hemesath, the board president for lobby group Farmers for Free Trade, which has raised concerns about the tariffs.  \nBig retailers in the US have already warned the measures will lead to higher prices on goods such as avocados within days, while economists are forecasting economic recessions in Mexico and Canada triggered by the tariffs.\nTrump has acknowledged his moves may lead to short-term economic pain in the US, but said he wants to protect US industry and boost manufacturing.\nHe has cast the tariffs this week against goods from America's two neighbours, as well as China, as a response to the flow of migrants and fentanyl across the border.\nWriting on social media on Wednesday, Trump said he had told Trudeau that the situation was not improving. \n\"He said that it's gotten better, but I said, 'That's not good enough',\" Trump said.\nTrudeau has called called Trump's claims about drugs a \"completely bogus\" justification for tariffs on his country.\nWhite House officials have said Trump still intends to move ahead on 2 April with plans for reciprocal tariffs on other countries around the world that he sees as treating the US unfairly. \n\"There are going to be tariffs - let's be clear - but what he's thinking about is which sections of the market that maybe he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg on Wednesday.",

On the first night, I'd only been in the country a couple of days, there was a girl from Lampeter and she knew my auntie's farm.\"\nIt is one thing to find these links organically, but under time pressure it becomes harder. \nAs The Cymru Connection theme music kicks in each week, James is often seen putting his head in his hands. \n\"I find it immensely stressful,\" he said. \n\"It pays off because as long as I Cymru Connect I'm floating on air for hours. If I fail I'm incredibly depressed for about a day.\n\"Often if I'm wearing a jumper or a jacket I've got to take it off because I start to sweat.

But that's where I begin.\"\nJames and Robins have worked together for more than a decade - firstly on XFM and now for the BBC - but have been friends for much longer.\n\"It's quite an interesting thing to observe because it's obviously a very natural interaction for Welsh people,\" said Robins, from Bristol.\n\"I watch Elis connecting thinking 'is this really happening every week?' and it is. It's on national radio.\"\nBut why is it happening? \nDr Martin Graff, a psychologist at the University of South Wales, believes \"we all want to meet people who have a degree of familiarity to ourselves\".\n\"In Wales there's three million of us \u2013 we're a fairly exclusive club. Therefore when we meet someone Welsh it's kind of thrilling.\n\"From an evolutionary angle, meeting someone who is familiar makes them more predictable.\n\"If people's behaviour is more predictable we feel safer in their company.\"\nBorn and bred in Bridgend, I couldn't finish my interview without putting James to the test - could he find a Cymru Connection with me?\nRobins, who acts as adjudicator, declared in advance that mutual BBC colleagues did not count.\nDespite that, after roughly 45 seconds, James managed to name somebody he knew who was in the year above me at school.\nJob done - our very own Cymru Connection.",

It is also not clear whether the effect works for all cancer or just specific ones. And this is still animal research so while the scientists think this would apply in people that will still need to be confirmed.\nSome patients - with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of cancers - are already recommended aspirin.\nBut it will still take proper clinical trials to understand whether more patients would benefit too. \nThese are already under way. Prof Ruth Langley, from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, is leading the Add-Aspirin trial to see if aspirin can stop early stage cancers from coming back. \nShe said the study's results were \"an important discovery\" as they would help to work out \"who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis\".\nHowever, she again warned of the risks of taking aspirin and to \"always talk to your doctor before starting\".\nIn the long-run, Prof Roychoudhuri suspects new drugs would be developed that take the benefits of aspirin, but with fewer of the risky side-effects.\nThe discovery, published in the journal Nature, happened by accident as the scientists were not researching aspirin.\nThe team in Cambridge were investigating how the immune system responded to cancers when they spread.\nThey were using genetically engineered mice and found those lacking a specific set of genetic instructions were less likely to get metastatic cancer that had spread.\nFurther investigation revealed how those T-cells were being suppressed and this started to overlap with how aspirin was known to work in the body. \nDr Jie Yang, who carried out the research, said: \"It was a Eureka moment.\n\"It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of inquiry than we had anticipated.\"",

        "article_text": "The trickiest Fantasy Premier League decisions to be made at the moment are around strikers and, with only 11 gameweeks left, getting a precious transfer right could make or break your season.\nChris Wood is the top-scoring striker and, despite facing Manchester City this week, is a solid hold for the rest of the season.\nBut there are question marks - some bigger than others - around the next six forwards in the FPL scoring charts:\nAlexander Isak, Newcastle - has a blank next week, slight injury worries.\nErling Haaland, Manchester City - blooming expensive.\nMatheus Cunha, Wolves - great fixtures, signed by nearly 700,000 managers last week but now banned for at least three games after his FA Cup red card.\nOllie Watkins, Aston Villa - not setting world alight with his form and also blanks next week.\nJean-Phillipe Mateta, Crystal Palace - popular signing with 200,000 bringing him in this week, eight goals in eight games but now likely out injured for a few games and blanks next week.\nYoane Wissa, Brentford - solid choice, cheapest option but with horrible fixture run.\nSo the question is, who do you look to beyond this bunch for a striker to lead you to your mini-league title?\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a \u00a3100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\nPicking Cole Palmer over Mohamed Salah as captain didn't hurt too much in the end, with just three points the difference.\nThe team was led by Chelsea assets - Marc Cucurella (15 points) and Pedro Neto (11) - and a double West Ham clean sheet.\nPatrick Dorgu getting sent off was not ideal but an above average 63 points was more than tolerable.\nListen to the latest Fantasy 606 podcast on BBC Sounds.\nThis video can not be played\nPanic Wildcards & Cunha replacements!\nDavid Raya, Arsenal, keeper, \u00a35.5m - Manchester United (a)\nAn away game against struggling United should hold no fear for Arsenal and Raya, who has three clean sheets in his past five games.\nDaniel Munoz, Crystal Palace, \u00a35m - Ipswich (h)\nThe Colombian has a goal or assist in six of his past seven games in all competitions, which is incredible for a right-back.\nHis 24 shots in the box is the second highest among defenders and a home tie against Ipswich is juicy, even though they have scored in their past five games.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool, \u00a37.4m - Southampton (h)\nThe game's best defender at home to a team trying to avoid the worst-ever Premier League season?\nIt's a straightforward choice and your only worry is whether Alexander-Arnold is rested, with a cup final and Champions League fixtures coming up for Liverpool.\nConor Bradley is injured, though, and you can't second guess what Arne Slot might do.\nMarc Cucurella, Chelsea, \u00a35.1m - Leicester (h)\nThe Spaniard keeps his spot in the team after last week's 15-pointer - and also because Chelsea have the second of two absolutely plum fixtures against struggling teams.\nThis time Leicester, who haven't scored in four games and have only 25 goals all season.\nThe cream rises to the top and Alexander-Arnold is now top of the FPL defender charts again after a slow-ish start to the season\nMohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - Southampton (h)\nOne of the easiest captain choices of the season, I'm expecting at least two returns.\nCole Palmer (vice captain), Chelsea, \u00a311.1m - Leicester (h)\nDespite blanking in Chelsea's 4-0 win last gameweek, you just can't ignore Palmer in what should be another comfortable victory at Stamford Bridge.\nAnother blank and there's a conversation to be had about selling him, but he had seven shots last week and an expected goals (xG) of 1.07.\nDominik Szoboszlai, Liverpool, \u00a36.4m - Southampton (h)\nThe Hungarian has quietly become Liverpool's most reliable midfield option behind Salah, with five goals and seven assists this season.\nHe has goals in his past two games and five double-digit returns in 2024-25, which is the kind of explosiveness you want.\nThis is a smashing home game for Liverpool and definitely worth a triple up.\nBryan Mbeumo, Brentford, \u00a38m - Aston Villa (h)\nI always like a rested team at home taking on one that has played midweek and you have to fancy Brentford to get something against what should be a tired Villa side.\nMbeumo is their talisman with 20 returns now this season after his assist last gameweek.\nDo you hold him for a tricky run coming up that includes Arsenal and Newcastle away? That will be a hard call to make soon.\nChristopher Nkunku, Chelsea, \u00a35.7m - Leicester (h)\nPedro Neto did a great job in this spot last week but Nkunku was perhaps even more impressive and has a much bigger goal threat than his Portuguese team-mate.\nHe's likely to be playing in the number nine position again, from where he had four shots and scored once against Southampton.\nNkunku has had an injury-hit Chelsea career but he is still only three seasons removed from a 20-goal league campaign (with RB Leipzig in Germany)\nBeto, Everton, \u00a35m - Wolves (a)\nWith West Ham at home next week, Beto is a great shout for the next two weeks and a decent budget option for the rest of the season.\nDespite a first blank in five games last time out against Brentford, his xG was 0.62. For context, it was 0.63 against Leicester when he scored twice.\nSo he is getting in positions to score and the fixture list shouldn't necessarily scare you with this David Moyes-led Everton side.\nEddie Nketiah, Crystal Palace, \u00a35.9m - Ipswich (h)\nA plum fixture for a talented but inconsistent striker who has not had the impact many thought he would have after joining Palace from Arsenal.\nNketiah has often scored in spurts - remember that hat-trick last season v Sheffield United?

        "summary": "Eddie the Eagle can fly v Ipswich - FPL tips & team of the weekImage source, BBC SportPublished8 hours ago12 CommentsThe trickiest Fantasy Premier League decisions to be made at the moment are around strikers and, with only 11 gameweeks left, getting a precious transfer right could make or break your season.Chris Wood is the top-scoring striker and, despite facing Manchester City this week, is a solid hold for the rest of the season.But there are question marks - some bigger than others - around the next six forwards in the FPL scoring charts:Alexander Isak, Newcastle - has a blank next week, slight injury worries.Erling Haaland, Manchester City - blooming expensive.Matheus Cunha, Wolves - great fixtures, signed by nearly 700,000 managers last week but now banned for at least three games after his FA Cup red card.Ollie Watkins, Aston Villa - not setting world alight with his form and also blanks next week.Jean-Phillipe Mateta, Crystal Palace - popular signing with 200,000 bringing him in this week, eight goals in eight games but now likely out injured for a few games and blanks next week.Yoane Wissa, Brentford - solid choice, cheapest option but with horrible fixture run.So the question is, who do you look to beyond this bunch for a striker to lead you to your mini-league title?The team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a \u00a3100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.How did last week's team do?Picking Cole Palmer over Mohamed Salah as captain didn't hurt too much in the end, with just three points the difference.The team was led by Chelsea assets - Marc Cucurella (15 points) and Pedro Neto (11) - and a double West Ham clean sheet.Patrick Dorgu getting sent off was not ideal but an above average 63 points was more than tolerable.Listen to the latest Fantasy 606 podcast on BBC Sounds.Keeper and defenceThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Panic Wildcards & Cunha replacements!David Raya, Arsenal, keeper, \u00a35.5m - Manchester United (a)An away game against struggling United should hold no fear for Arsenal and Raya, who has three clean sheets in his past five games.Daniel Munoz, Crystal Palace, \u00a35m - Ipswich (h)The Colombian has a goal or assist in six of his past seven games in all competitions, which is incredible for a right-back.His 24 shots in the box is the second highest among defenders and a home tie against Ipswich is juicy, even though they have scored in their past five games.Trent Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool, \u00a37.4m - Southampton (h)The game's best defender at home to a team trying to avoid the worst-ever Premier League season?It's a straightforward choice and your only worry is whether Alexander-Arnold is rested, with a cup final and Champions League fixtures coming up for Liverpool.Conor Bradley is injured, though, and you can't second guess what Arne Slot might do.Marc Cucurella, Chelsea, \u00a35.1m - Leicester (h)The Spaniard keeps his spot in the team after last week's 15-pointer - and also because Chelsea have the second of two absolutely plum fixtures against struggling teams.This time Leicester, who haven't scored in four games and have only 25 goals all season.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The cream rises to the top and Alexander-Arnold is now top of the FPL defender charts again after a slow-ish start to the seasonMidfieldMohamed Salah (captain), Liverpool, \u00a313.8m - Southampton (h)One of the easiest captain choices of the season, I'm expecting at least two returns.Cole Palmer (vice captain), Chelsea, \u00a311.1m - Leicester (h)Despite blanking in Chelsea's 4-0 win last gameweek, you just can't ignore Palmer in what should be another comfortable victory at Stamford Bridge.Another blank and there's a conversation to be had about selling him, but he had seven shots last week and an expected goals (xG) of 1.07.Dominik Szoboszlai, Liverpool, \u00a36.4m - Southampton (h)The Hungarian has quietly become Liverpool's most reliable midfield option behind Salah, with five goals and seven assists this season.He has goals in his past two games and five double-digit returns in 2024-25, which is the kind of explosiveness you want.This is a smashing home game for Liverpool and definitely worth a triple up.Bryan Mbeumo, Brentford, \u00a38m - Aston Villa (h)I always like a rested team at home taking on one that has played midweek and you have to fancy Brentford to get something against what should be a tired Villa side.Mbeumo is their talisman with 20 returns now this season after his assist last gameweek.Do you hold him for a tricky run coming up that includes Arsenal and Newcastle away? That will be a hard call to make soon.Christopher Nkunku, Chelsea, \u00a35.7m - Leicester (h)Pedro Neto did a great job in this spot last week but Nkunku was perhaps even more impressive and has a much bigger goal threat than his Portuguese team-mate.He's likely to be playing in the number nine position again, from where he had four shots and scored once against Southampton.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nkunku has had an injury-hit Chelsea career but he is still only three seasons removed from a 20-goal league campaign (with RB Leipzig in Germany)StrikersBeto, Everton, \u00a35m - Wolves (a)With West Ham at home next week, Beto is a great shout for the next two weeks and a decent budget option for the rest of the season.Despite a first blank in five games last time out against Brentford, his xG was 0.62. For context, it was 0.63 against Leicester when he scored twice.So he is getting in positions to score and the fixture list shouldn't necessarily scare you with this David Moyes-led Everton side.Eddie Nketiah, Crystal Palace, \u00a35.9m - Ipswich (h)A plum fixture for a talented but inconsistent striker who has not had the impact many thought he would have after joining Palace from Arsenal.Nketiah has often scored in spurts - remember that hat-trick last season v Sheffield United? He has that kind of upside and you could take a flyer on him this week.Ipswich have conceded a lot recently, even letting in two against Southampton, so this is a golden opportunity with Mateta out injured.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nketiah scored his first league goal for Palace in the 4-1 win over Aston Villa last weekSubs benchDean Henderson, Crystal Palace, keeper, \u00a34.6m - Ipswich (h)Joao Pedro, Brighton, striker, \u00a35.4m - Fulham (h)Rayan Ait-Nouri, Wolves, defender, \u00a34.7m - Everton (h)Jake O'Brien, Everton, defender, \u00a34.5m - Wolves (a)Team total cost: \u00a398.1mPlayer to watchImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Savinho is Manchester City's second-highest points scorer in midfield this season, with 88 points (behind Phil Foden)Savinho, Manchester City, midfielder, \u00a36.2mIf you are looking at City's upcoming fixtures but don't want to sign a striker, then what about bargain Brazilian Savinho?He has started City's past four league games and now has 10 assists - more than any midfielder except Salah and Bukayo Saka.Pep roulette is less likely to be an issue for the rest of the season too, with City out of Europe, meaning his starting place could be fairly secure.Team to targetTottenham - Bournemouth (h), Fulham (a), Chelsea (a)Spurs play in the gameweek 29 blank and after the run of games above they have Southampton (h) and Wolves (a).They've won three of their past four after a dreadful run so why not consider a midfield asset like Son Heung-min (\u00a39.7m, 10 assists) or Brennan Johnson (\u00a36.2m, nine goals)?Related topicsLiverpoolBrentfordChelseaPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceArsenalEvertonFootballPremier League indexPremier League tablePremier League fixturesMore on this storyFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to youPublished11 August 2023",

Osborne, 23, has played on the wing for Leinster, but this will be his first time in the position at Test level.\nRonan Kelleher (neck) remains sidelined, so Rob Herring is set to make his first appearance of the tournament as replacement hooker with Dan Sheehan starting.\nGarry Ringrose's suspension means Bundee Aki returns to partner Robbie Henshaw in midfield, the latter switching to outside centre. \nFinlay Bealham returns at tight-head prop and Thomas Clarkson drops to the bench. Tadhg Furlong is still ruled out despite stepping up his rehabilitation from calf and hamstring injuries.\nLike Doris, Bealham and Jack Conan are set to win their 50th caps. Conan is one of six forwards named on the bench as Ireland opt to go for a 6-2 split for the first time this year.\n\"The team has worked hard again this week and the preparation has been positive for what we know will be a huge test against France,\" said Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby.\n\"There's great respect and rivalry between the two teams and it should be a cracking contest.\"\nNtamack and Penaud return as France retain 7-1 bench\nSix Nations fixtures, standings, try-scorers & coverage\nSeven-one bench split would 'spook' Ireland - Fogarty\nAfter announcing they will retire from Test rugby at the end of the tournament, Peter O'Mahony, Cian Healy and Conor Murray will play in their final home match.\nMunster flanker O'Mahony retains his place after starting against Scotland and Wales, while Healy and Murray are named on the bench.\n\"This weekend gives the Irish public the chance to mark the final home international appearances for Peter, Cian and Conor \u2013 three stalwarts of Irish rugby who help drive the highest standards in our camp,\" added Easterby.\nHerring, Healy, Clarkson, Conan, James Ryan and Ryan Baird provide the forwards cover with Murray and Jack Crowley named as the two replacement backs.\nIt is the first time Ireland have opted for a 6-2 split on the bench since last year's loss in England - a result which ended Irish hopes of back-to-back Grand Slams.\nIreland did, however, use a 6-2 split in last year's resounding victory over France in Marseille.\nFrance, who named their team earlier on Thursday, have retained a 7-1 split on the bench having used the tactic against Italy last time out.\nIreland: Keenan; Osborne, Henshaw, Aki, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Porter, Sheehan, Bealham; McCarthy, Beirne; O'Mahony, Van der Flier, Doris (capt). \nReplacements: Herring, Healy, Clarkson, Ryan, Conan, Baird, Murray, Crowley.\nFrance: Ramos; Penaud, Barassi, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Ntamack, Dupont (capt); Gros, Mauvaka, Atonio; Flament, Guillard; Cros, Boudehent, Alldritt.\nReplacements: Marchand, Baille, Aldegheri, Meafou, Auradou, Jegou, Jelonch, Lucu.\nThis video can not be played\nKidnapping their dads, crazy tattoos & hairy shoulders",

        "article_text": "Football fans - including Manchester United supporters at Old Trafford last weekend - have protested against rising ticket prices this season\nFootball fans can be tribal.

The report also says Chelsea spent almost 2bn euros (\u00a31.7bn) in transfer fees in the five-year period to 2024.\nFour of the five most profitable clubs - by pre-tax profits - in 2024 were German: Bayern (\u00a353m), Borussia Dortmund (\u00a341m), Lazio (\u00a334m), Leipzig (\u00a331m), Eintracht Frankfurt (\u00a327m).\nThree of the five least profitable clubs in 2024 - by pre-tax losses - were English: Juventus (\u00a3164m), Chelsea (\u00a393m), Aston Villa (\u00a384m), Roma (\u00a363m), Liverpool (\u00a355m).\nPlumley says: \"Each individual club will have its own reasons for doing it, but raising ticket prices doesn't shift the dial massively in terms of the overall picture of the finances.\n\"I get that costs have gone up, we understand that side of the equation, but this is where it really grinds with fans.\"\nFans of some clubs have been contesting the loss of concessionary tickets for the elderly, juniors, and disabled supporters\nManchester United's controversial plans to make up to 450 redundancies,, external cut about 39% of its workforce and \"return the club to profitability\" have put a sharper focus on how many people are actually needed to run a football club - and the operating costs involved.\nWhile transfer spending remains a club's biggest outgoing, the report says high inflation in areas such as utilities, plus the wages spent on more employees to expand commercial activity, is biting. \nOperating costs have risen by 12% across Europe, with a total of \u00a31.5bn spent in the Premier League in 2023, almost \u00a3500m higher than second-placed Germany\nOperating costs plus non-player wages absorb just under half the revenue of big-five European league clubs\nIn 2024, six Premier League teams featured in the top 10 for money spent on operating costs.\n\"Operations costs have increased - that's fair,\" Greatrex says. \"But increasing ticket prices way beyond the level of inflation, year after year, which is what has started to happen with most clubs in the Premier League - and then trying to claim that PSR or financial fair play are the reason - is the clubs treating people as though they're idiots.\"\nSalaries paid to non-footballer staff members have also risen sharply.\nThe average top 20 club in Europe has 970 full-time employees - Barcelona have the most with 1,781\nFour Premier League teams have more than 1,000 full-time employees - Man Utd, Brighton, Liverpool and Man City\nPremier League clubs employed a total of 11,081 full-time employees by the end of 2023\nEnglish top-flight clubs paid a total of \u00a31bn in non-player wages in 2023. That total, which includes wages paid to staff members such as coaches, media departments and ticket office personnel, is more than twice that of second-placed Germany\nThere was 19% inflation on non-player wages across Europe in 2023 and for the biggest clubs, head coach wages rose on average 21% in 2024\nThat compares to a more modest average growth of 4.5% in player wages in 2024, which the report said was \"essential for financial stability as clubs struggle with strong inflation\".\nThe logic behind the rise in staffing numbers varies per club. Brighton, for example, employ a notoriously vast recruitment and scouting operation.\nThe report states that employee growth can be explained by clubs' desire to wring more from commercial and sponsorship deals.\nAcross Europe, income from commercial and sponsorship deals has risen by 39% since 2019.\n\"Commercial income is almost untapped in terms of potential and there is no restriction on the number of deals you can sign,\" Plumley says. \n\"But you have to throw more resource at that.\n\"There are more roles now in football clubs than ever before. Some of them are quite forward thinking.\n\"It's a natural consequence of how the game has evolved, because everyone is pushing for growth, growth, growth.\"",

        "article_text": "It is often said that marriages are made in heaven.\nBut in India, where a majority of marriages are arranged, the process of match-making can feel like a passage through hell for a woman and her family.\nThat's the premise of Sthal: A Match, the 2023 gritty Marathi-language film that has won several prestigious awards at festivals in India and abroad. It is releasing for the first time in theatres in India on Friday.\nSet in rural Maharashtra state, the film centres around Savita, a young woman striving for an education and a career in a patriarchal society, and the attempts by her father Daulatrao Wandhare - a poor cotton farmer - to find a good husband for his daughter.\n\"He wants a good price for his crop and a good match for his daughter,\" says director Jayant Digambar Somalkar.\nThe film is notable for the unflinching way it portrays what its lead actress calls the \"very humiliating\" experience of many young women, unlike other Indian movies about arranged marriage.\nSthal has also grabbed attention as its entire cast is made up of first-time actors chosen from the village where it is shot. Nandini Chikte, who plays Savita, has already won two awards for her brilliant performance.\nThe film opens with a sequence where Savita is interviewing a prospective groom.\nAlong with her female relatives and friends, she watches as the young man serves them drinks from a tray. They laugh when he, visibly nervous, fumbles during questioning.\nRudely awakened from what turned out to be a dream, Savita is told to get ready as a group of men are coming to see her.\nIn reality, the gender roles are completely reversed, and in a scene that's replayed several times in the nearly two-hour film, Savita's humiliation comes into sharp focus.\nThe prospective groom and other men from his family are welcomed by Savita's father and male relatives. Guests are fed tea and snacks and once the introductions are done, Savita is called in.\nDressed in a sari, with eyes downcast, she sits down on a wooden stool facing her interrogators.\nQuestions come, thick and fast. What's your name? Full name? Mother's clan? Date of birth? Height? Education? Subject? Hobbies? Are you willing to work on the farm? \nThe men step out, to hold a discussion. \"She's a bit dark. She had makeup on her face, but did you not see her elbow? That is her real colour,\" says one. \"She's also short,\" he goes on to add. Others nod in agreement.\nThey leave, telling Daulatrao that they will respond in a few days to let him know their decision.\nAccording to her parents, \"this is the fourth or fifth time someone has come to see Savita\" - all the earlier meetings have ended in rejection, leading to heartbreak and despair.\nThe scene rings true. In India, men often have a laundry list of attributes they want in their brides - a glance at the matrimonial columns in newspapers and match-making websites shows everyone wants tall, fair, beautiful brides.\nSavita's protestations - \"I don't want to get married, I first want to finish college and then take civil services exams and build a career\" - carry no weight in her rural community, where marriage is presented as the only goal worth having for a young woman.\n\"Marriage is given far too much importance in our society,\" Chikte told the BBC. \"Parents believe that once the daughter is married, they will become free of their responsibility. It's time to change that narrative.\" \nShe says she found it \"very humiliating\" that Savita was made to sit on a stool to be judged by all those men who discussed her skin colour, while there was no discussion about the prospective groom.\n\"I was only acting, but as the film progressed, I lived Savita's journey and I felt angry on her behalf. I felt insulted and disrespected.\" \nThe film also tackles the social evil that is dowry - the practice of the bride's family gifting cash, clothes and jewellery to the groom's family. \nThough it has been illegal for more than 60 years, dowries are still omnipresent in Indian weddings.\nParents of girls are known to take out huge loans or even sell their land and house to meet dowry demands. Even that doesn't necessarily ensure a happy life for a bride as tens of thousands are killed every year by the groom or his family for bringing in insufficient dowries. \nIn the film too, Daulatrao puts up a \"for sale\" sign on his land, even though farming is his only source of livelihood.\nDirector Somalkar says the idea for his debut feature film is rooted in his own experience.\nGrowing up with two sisters and five female cousins, he had witnessed the ritual far too many times when prospective grooms visited his home.\n\"As a child you don't question tradition,\" he says, adding that the turning point came in 2016 when he accompanied a male cousin to see a prospective bride.\n\"This was the first time I was on the other side. I felt a bit uncomfortable when the woman came out and sat on a stool and was asked questions. When we stepped out for a discussion, I felt the conversation about her height and skin colour was objectifying her.\"\nWhen he discussed the issue with his fianc\u00e9e at the time - who is now his wife - she encouraged him to explore it in his work.\nIn a country where 90% of all marriages are still arranged by families, Sthal is not the first to tackle the subject on screen. IMDB has a list of nearly 30 films about arranged marriage made by Bollywood and regional film industries just in the past two decades. \nMore recently, the wildly popular Netflix show Indian Matchmaking focused entirely on the process of finding the perfect partner.\nBut, as Somalkar points out, \"weddings are hugely glamourised\" on screen. \n\"When we think of weddings in India, we think of the big fat wedding full of fun and glamour. We think of Hum Aapke Hain Koun,\" he says, referring to the 1990s Bollywood blockbuster that celebrates Indian wedding traditions. \n\"And the Netflix show only dealt with a certain class of people, the ones who are wealthy and educated and the women are able to exercise their choice. \n\"But the reality for a majority of Indians is very different and parents often have to go through hell to get their daughters married,\" he adds.\nHis reason for making Sthal, he says, is to \"jolt society and audiences out of complacency. \n\"I want to start a debate and encourage people to think about a process that objectifies women who have very little freedom to choose between marriage and career,\" he says. \n\"I know one book or one film doesn't change society overnight, but it can be a start.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

And players will not have to repay the money if they later choose not to return to the sport.Grants will also be made available for fertility treatment.The maternity programme will be fully funded by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is a global partner of the WTA Tour. \"Players will have to compete in a minimum of eight WTA events in the previous 12 months (or a minimum of 24 in the previous 36 months) to be eligible.Raducanu to start trial with coach PlatenikPublished1 day agoBritain face Poland in Davis Cup relegation play-offPublished1 day agoIndian Wells loss 'worst match I've ever played' - OsakaPublished1 day agoReturning to the tour after maternity leave has become easier since the WTA changed the rules before the 2019 season.New mothers are now be able to use their previous ranking to enter 12 tournaments over a three-year period from the birth of their child.Since 2019, returning mothers with a special ranking high enough to be seeded have also had a guarantee they will not face a seeded player in the opening round of their first eight tournaments.A seeding allows tournaments to ensure the world's best players do not meet in the early stages of competitions and instead play lower-ranked players in the opening rounds.The WTA says 50 players have benefitted from the special ranking since it was introduced six years ago.The WTA also offers access to a health team and taskforce, which includes physical assessments, mental health support and guidance on a staged return to play for new mothers and pregnant players.Related topicsTennis Petra Kvitova and Belinda Bencic have both made their comeback from maternity leave in recent months.Former world number one Victoria Azarenka, who gave birth to son Leo in 2016, told the BBC last year that it would be a \"huge win for women in general\" if the WTA was to introduce maternity pay.Four-time major champion Naomi Osaka also spoke in support of maternity pay, saying it would be \"life-changing\". \"In women's professional sports, particularly sports where athletes are self-employed, this has never been something that has been provided.",

But do you think he really understands history?\"\nHis comments were \"deeply disappointing\" and made his position \"untenable\", New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.\nHis comments came after Trump paused military aid to Kyiv following a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week.\nHe contrasted Trump with Churchill who, while estranged from the British government, spoke against the Munich Agreement as he saw it as a surrender to Nazi Germany's threats. \nMr Goff quoted how Churchill had rebuked then UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain: \"You had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, yet you will have war.\"\nPeters said Mr Goff's views did not represent those of the New Zealand government.\n\"When you are in that position you represent the government and the policies of the day, you're not able to free think, you are the face of New Zealand,\" local media reported Peters saying.\n\"It's not the way you behave as the front face of a country, diplomatically,\" he said, adding that he would have taken the same course of action no matter which country was being spoken about.\nMr Goff is a veteran politician who had been high commissioner since January 2023. Before that, he served for two terms as mayor of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and was leader of the Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence.\nPeters, who is also deputy prime minister, told reporters that he had made the decision to sack Phil Goff without first consulting Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.\nWhen it was pointed out that Luxon was the leader of New Zealand, Peters responded: \"I know he's the prime minister, I made him the prime minister.\"\nThe 79-year-old, who has previously worked with Mr Goff in government, leads the New Zealand First political party - which joined Luxon's National Party and the Act Party in 2023 to form the current ruling centre-right coalition government. \nLuxon, for his part, said Peters' decision to fire Mr Goff without first consulting him was \"entirely appropriate\". \nFormer Prime Minister Helen Clark was among those who criticised Mr Goff's sacking, saying it was backed by a \"very thin excuse\".\n\"I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938 and US actions now,\" she wrote in a post on X.\nUnder the 1938 Munich Agreement, Hitler took control of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland. The deal failed to stop Nazi Germany from advancing deeper into Europe and World War Two began when he invaded Poland in 1939.",

PRC is short for the People's Republic of China.\nA Hong Kong newspaper was also on the list. While it was not named, the statement said that it was \"considered as being opposed to the PRC government\". \nBesides US agencies, hackers were said to have targeted the foreign ministries of Taiwan, India, South Korea and Indonesia.\nLast October, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said hacks targeting two major US presidential campaigns were carried out by \"actors affiliated with the People's Republic of China\".\nEarlier last year, seven Chinese nationals were charged with running a hacking operation that lasted at least 14 years and targeted foreign critics of China.\nOperations linked by Western governments to China have also targeted the UK's Electoral Commission, and the UK and New Zealand parliaments.\nAs part of its long-running rewards programme, the US State Department said it was offering up to $10m for information on i-Soon, its employees and Chinese officials \"engaged in malicious cyber activities highlighted in the Department of Justice's indictments\".",

He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.\nUS officials accused Sharifullah of being a member of IS-K, a group that took credit for the attack and that has been proscribed as a terror organisation by governments around the world.\nAt least 170 Afghans died alongside 13 US service members in the attack, which resulted in intense criticism for then-US President Joe Biden.\nCurrent US President Donald Trump, who often blamed Biden and Former Vice-President Kamala Harris for the service members' deaths, announced Sharifullah's arrest in his address to Congress on Tuesday.\n\"He is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,\" Trump told his audience.\nThe next day, Sharifullah appeared in court wearing a blue jail jumpsuit, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. He stood at about 5ft tall (150cm), wore a surgical face mask and communicated in a packed courtroom via an interpreter.\nAfter a brief hearing that discussed his lack of assets and need for a defence lawyer, the federal judge overseeing the case ordered Sharifullah to be held in custody until a formal detention hearing on Monday.\nSeveral justice department officials who were recently appointed to office by Trump praised the president for the arrest, and FBI chief Kash Patel shared an image of him in custody.\n\"Under President Trump's strong leadership on the world stage, this Department of Justice will ensure that terrorists like Mohammad Sharifullah have no safe haven, no second chances, and no worse enemy than the United States of America,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said.\nA family member of two Afghans who died in the aftermath of the attack said he was upset with Trump after the speech. \n\"He talked about the 13 US soldiers killed but not anything about us,\" he told the BBC. \"We want the Americans to pay attention to us and take us to America as they promised,\" the man added. \nThe bombing of Abbey Gate at the Kabul airport occurred in the final days of the chaotic US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. The attacker triggered a bomb in a crowd of thousands of Afghans who had gathered at the airport in hopes of being evacuated before the Taliban took full control of the country.\nCongressional criticism of the Biden administration spiked in the aftermath, and it caused a decline in the public's confidence in the then-president.\nThe justice department alleged that Sharifullah \"admitted to helping prepare for the Abbey Gate, including scouting a route near the airport for an attack\" during an interview with the FBI.\nSharifullah allegedly admitted to his involvement in several other attacks during the interview, including a June 2016 suicide bombing attack on the Canadian embassy in Kabul and the March 2024 gunmen attack on Crocus City Hall near Moscow, Russia.\nRussia arrested four gunmen in connection with the attack in which it accused Ukraine of being involved.\n\"Sharifullah admitted that, on behalf of ISIS-K, he had shared instructions on how to use AK-style rifles and other weapons to would-be attackers.

Israel began military operations after Hamas's October 2023 attack which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 more taken hostage.\nGaza has suffered vast destruction with a huge humanitarian impact.

Sheen said he was able to set up a debt acquisition company with \u00a3100,000 of his own money to buy \u00a31m worth of debt because it had come down in value.Although the system was \"bizarre\" and he initially had \"no idea\" how it worked, Sheen said \"it seemed like a good thing to do\". Currently, Sheen confirmed that he has helped 900 people with their debts across south Wales. Sheen to fund new national theatre for WalesFinal curtain goes down on National Theatre Wales It comes two months after Sheen announced he was funding a new theatre company to fill the gap left by the folding of National Theatre Wales.In 2021, Sheen declared himself a \"not-for-profit\" actor, pledging to use all the money he earns for good causes. The company was not set up in Sheen's name and he had to be at \"arm's length from it\".He did not know the identity of people's debts he paid off, he only knew where they lived and the kind of debt it was.Sheen added: \"I would never know who they are - I still don't know who they are.",

I want to go on and create a great legacy,\" said Price.\nThere is uncertainty surrounding Jonas' career, though, as the fine run in the twilight of the Liverpudlian's career is halted.\nJonas - a two-weight world champion - loses for the third time in 19 pro bouts and suggested she could call time.\n\"It's something I'll look at when I go home,\" she said. \"Right now I'm going to go home and spend some time with my daughter.\"\nThis video can not be played\nLauren Price improved her pro record to 9-0, with her last defeat in the amateurs in 2018\nDubois retains title with points win against Shin\nRelive Price's classy points win over Jonas\nThe raucous atmosphere was at odds with the regal 5,272-capacity auditorium, which has hosted British boxing since 1918 and was about 80% full. \nThe crowd, split quite equally between men and women, sat in plush, cushioned seats to enjoy the theatre of boxing.\nPrice, in all black, made her ring walk first to a huge chorus of boos drowned out by Welsh folk song Yma o Hyd, which blared out of the sound system.\nThe trailblazing Jonas - the first ever British female to box at an Olympics - rather fittingly entered to Extraordinary Being by Emeli Sand\u00e9 and Beyonce's Run the World (Girls).\nIn the dressing room before the fight, trainer Joe Gallagher drilled into Jonas how to deal with Price's burst of punches, but 'Miss GB' struggled with her opponent's speed from the outset.\nJonas was backed on to the ropes in the second, felt the power of a counter left, then stumbled when caught by a right.\nPrice bounced confidently on her toes and continued to assert dominance as Jonas missed wildly. \nAs her sister, footballer Nikita Parris, watching on with some of her England team-mates, plus TV celebrities including presenters Romesh Ranganathan and Stacey Dooley, Jonas began to let her hands go in the fifth.\nThe success was short lived. A sensational right hand sent Jonas' head spinning in the seventh.\n\"You've got to throw some punches, love,\" trainer Gallagher told Jonas. It all felt a little too late as the result became increasingly inevitable.\nThose sitting in the second tier and gallery had a breathtaking bird's-eye view of the action as Jonas hit the canvas in the ninth after a slip.\nPrice continued to pick Jonas apart until the final seconds.\nPrice became Wales' first ever female world champion when she beat Jessica McCaskill last year.\nLess than a year later, she is one win away from unifying the division. A win over American Mayer would introduce Price to a global audience, while an all-British showdown with Derby's Ryan could headline a UK show.\n\"I want to follow in the footsteps of Katie Taylor - I'm Welsh, I'm an Olympic champion, I've got a nation behind me,\" she said.\nJonas, meanwhile, has achieved so much in the sport, but after a long, arduous career now could be the time to hang up the gloves.\nShe is a fantastic and articulate pundit, manages young fighters and has also helped trainer Gallagher in the corner.\nWith all her experience and knowledge of the sport, she will be an integral part of British boxing - in whatever capacity - for years to come.\nJonas had not tasted defeat since 2021 before losing to Price\nThis video can not be played\nWhen Lauren Price met The Prince of Wales\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and has doubled the levy recently put on Chinese goods.\nBut the day after these began, Trump announced a month-long exemption for US carmakers, who were expected to be badly affected. \nHe previously announced tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports.\nCanada and China have retaliated with tariffs of their own against US goods, sparking fears of a global trade war and higher prices.\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nThe companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government.\nTypically, tariffs are a percentage of a product's value.  Imposing a 20% tariff on Chinese goods means a product worth $10 (\u00a37.76) would have an additional $2 charge applied to it.\nFirms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers. \nThe US has typically charged lower tariffs on goods than other countries, which means his reciprocal plan could lead to a sudden and sharp increase in the tax rates - and to the prices people pay at checkout.\nTariffs are a central part of Trump's economic plans. He says tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, as well as raising tax revenue and growing the economy. \nGoods from China, Mexico and Canada accounted for more than 40% of imports into the US in 2024.\nWhen he first announced plans for new tariffs, the White House said the president was \"taking bold action to hold [the three countries] accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country\".\nFentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the US each year.\nThe Trump administration says the chemicals come from China, while Mexican gangs supply it illegally and run fentanyl labs in Canada. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US, most of which comes from Mexico. \nA 10% charge on all goods imported from China started on 4 February. \nTrump later said shipments worth less than $800 would be exempt.\nOn 10 February, China responded with its own tariffs, including a 10-15% tax on some US agricultural goods.\nBeijing has also targeted various US aviation, defence and tech firms by adding them to an \"unreliable entity list\" and imposing export controls. \nThe 10% levy doubled to 20% on 4 March. \nChina urged the US to return to dialogue with Beijing as soon as possible.\n\"If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian warned. \nTrump has introduced 25% tariffs on goods from both US neighbours, Canada and Mexico. These were originally due to begin on 4 February but finally started on 4 March. \nMeanwhile, Canadian energy imports face a 10% tariff. \nTrump had previously said the month-long delay would let the US see \"whether or not a final economic deal with Canada\" could be reached. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau criticised the tariffs as a \"very dumb thing to do\", and accused Trump of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\".\nHe said his country would immediately target C$30bn worth of products entering from the US, and goods worth a further C$125bn in 21 days.\nCanada may also restrict US access to its energy. It is the top oil supplier to the US and also provides some electricity to 30% of the states.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said he would implement his own 25% surcharge on Canadian electricity exports to three US states: Michigan, New York and Minnesota.\nAnd he said he would consider completely cutting those states off from Canadian power if the US tariffs escalated. \nMexico also delayed retaliatory tariffs on US goods after the initial US pause. \nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to send 10,000 members of the National Guard to the US-Mexican border to \"prevent the trafficking of drugs, in particular fentanyl\".\nShe said the US had in turn agreed to increase measures to prevent the trafficking of high-powered American weapons into Mexico.\nSpeaking after Trump's tariffs came into force on 4 March, Sheinbaum said the US's decision to go ahead with 25% levies had \"no justification\" - adding that Mexico wanted respect from its northern neighbour.\nMexico will impose \"tariff and non-tariff measures\" in response, she added, and promised to set out further details on 9 March. \nThe month-long tariff exemption is for cars made in North America that comply with the continent's existing free trade agreement.\nThat deal, which was negotiated by Trump during his first term in office, sets out rules for how much of a car must be made in each country to qualify for duty-free treatment.\nThe Canadian and Mexican tariffs prompted fears of significant impacts on car manufacturing. Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.  \nThe average US car price could increase by $3,000 because of the import taxes, financial analyst TD Economics suggested. \nShares in Ford were up by more than 5% after the announcement, while General Motors shares rose more than 7%.\nTrump said the 25% tariff on both metals will come into effect on 12 March, with no exceptions. \nThe US is the world's largest importer of steel, with Canada, Brazil and Mexico its top three suppliers. \nCanada also provided more than 50% of the aluminium imported into the US in 2024. \nAmerican companies that use steel and aluminium to make products have warned the tariffs could push their prices up.\nThe Canadian government said the tariffs were \"totally unjustified\" and vowed swift retaliation. \nTrump previously announced tariffs of 25% on steel and 15% on aluminium in 2018, during his first term as president. However, he later negotiated exceptions for many countries including Australia, Canada and Mexico.\nDespite the exemptions, tariffs raised the average price of steel and aluminium in the US by 2.4% and 1.6% respectively, according to the US International Trade Commission.\nAll goods from China worth more than $800 are covered by the tariff. \nAll steel imports from around the world face a 25% tax. \nMexican and Canadian goods will also be subject to a 25% levy. A 10% tariff has been added to Canadian energy exports.\nGoods from Mexico that could be affected include fruit, vegetables, spirits and beer.\nIn addition to steel, Canadian goods such as timber, grains and potatoes are also likely to get more expensive. \nAn increase in the cost of Canadian oil and electricity could push up prices across the board. \nUS tariffs on imported washing machines between 2018 and 2023 increased the price of laundry equipment by 34%, according to official statistics. Prices fell once the tariffs expired.\nThe Federal Reserve of Atlanta has estimated that the Mexico and Canada tariffs, combined with adding another 10% tariff on Chinese goods, could raise prices on everyday purchases by 0.81% to 1.63%.\nSome experts suggest that Trump's new round of tariffs could prompt a wider trade war that could put prices up more generally. \nCapitol Economics said the annual rate of US inflation could increase from 2.9% to as high as 4%. \nTrump previously told the BBC the UK was \"out of line\", but suggested a solution could be \"worked out\".\nThe UK exports pharmaceutical products, cars and scientific instruments to the US. \nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK should be excluded from tariffs because it buys more from the US than it sells there. \nSpeaking in Parliament after the announcement of the steel and aluminium tariffs, Trade Minister Douglas Alexander promised a \"cool and clear-headed\" response.\nDuring his 26 February cabinet meeting, Trump said he would announce sanctions on EU goods \"very soon\".\n\"It'll be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things,\" he added.\nThe US had a trade deficit of $213bn with the EU in 2024 - something Trump has previously described as \"an atrocity\". \nIn response, the European Commission said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\".\nUS companies Harley Davidson and Jack Daniel's have previously faced EU tariffs.",

And I think we need a policeman to ensure international law and order but if the United States does not want to execute that role, then Europe must be able to defend itself, to stand on its own feet.\"\nFogh Rasmussen doesn't though believe the policeman is about to turn felon.\n\"I would like to stress I don't think at the end of the day that the Americans will take Greenland by force.\"\nPresident Trump first talked about a Greenland takeover in his first term of office before returning to the theme at the start of this year.\nBut now, after blindsiding supposed allies with his latest moves on Ukraine, tariffs, as well as the Middle East, Denmark is urgently trying the assess the true threat.\nFor many younger Danes, control of Greenland is plain wrong - an unfathomable colonial hangover.\nIt doesn't mean they want it handed straight over the US instead.\n\"We do have connections to Greenland,\" says music student Molly. \"Denmark and Greenland are quite separated I would say but I still have friends from there so this does affect me quite personally.\"\n\"I find it really scary,\" says 18-year-old music student Luukas.\n\"Everything he sees, he goes after. And the thing with the oil and money, he doesn't care about the climate, he doesn't care about anyone or anything.\"\nHis friend Clara chips in that Trump is now so powerful he can \"affect their day-to-day life\" from thousands of miles away, in what is an era of unprecedented jeopardy.\nIn light of President Trump's suspension of military aid for Ukraine and his deep reluctance to fund Europe's security, Denmark has been at the heart of the drive to boost defence spending across the continent.\nThe country has just announced it will allocate more than 3% of its GDP to defence spending in 2025 and 2026 to protect against future aggression from Russia or elsewhere.\nMeanwhile, security analyst Hans Tino Hansen stands in front of a huge screen in what he calls his \"ops room\", at his Copenhagen headquarters.\n\"This map is where we update on a daily basis our threat picture based on alerts and incidents all over the world,\" says Hans, who has been running Risk Intelligence for the past 25 years.\nAs part of Denmark's increased defence spending, it's bolstering its strength in the \"High North\" with an extra two billion euros announced in January and three new Arctic naval vessels and investment in long-range drones.\nHans believes Arctic security can be tightened further, not by an American takeover - but with new deals that restore US influence.\n\"If you make more agreements, both on defence and security, but also economic ones and on raw materials, then we are more or less going back to where we were in the 50s and 60s.\"\nBut the story stretches further back than the mid-20th Century.\n\"If you look at this globe, Greenland is the most centrally located place on Earth,\" says world-renowned geologist Prof Minik Rosing, gesticulating in his wood-panelled office.\nThe serenity of his room reflects the temperament of a man who grew up in a settlement of just \"seven or eight people\" in the Nuuk fjord of the island.\nBut a key reason his homeland is now coming under increasing scrutiny from outsiders is the rich mineral deposits beneath the Arctic ice.\nWe've seen how Ukraine's natural resources have caught President Trump's eye in much the same way.\n\"All these minerals that they talk about like rare metals, rare earth elements - they are actually not rare. What is rare is the use of them,\" he reasons.\nProf Rosing says the vastness of Greenland and the lack of infrastructure are just two elements why the island may not be the cashpoint some Americans are hoping for.\n\"They are a minuscule part of the mining industry and the economy of extracting them is very uncertain, whereas the investment to start extracting is very high. The risk of the investment is too high relative to the potential gain.\"\nThe current Greenlandic government says there will be a vote on independence at some point following next week's election.\nAlthough surely unintentional, President Trump's designs on the island have shone a light on a desire found among the Inuit to finally break free from 300 years of Danish control.\nBut Prof Rosing believes, despite all the latent mineral wealth, his fellow Greenlanders are in no hurry to forego the annual block grant of the equivalent of \u00a3480m (\u20ac570m) it receives from Copenhagen.\nThis accounts for easily more than half of the island's public budget.\n\"People talk about health services, schools, the next outboard engine they want on their boat and what is the price of gas and all of these things that normal people do,\" he says.\n\"It's not like they stand up with a big knife, wave it in the air and shout independence, independence.\"\nIn terms of Trump's apparent obsession with taking Greenland, Fogh Rasmussen fears there may be a troubling conclusion to be drawn.\nOne that would render the Danes unable to do business with a man whose view on territorial integrity is so wildly incompatible from theirs.\n\"I understand very well the American strategic interest in the minerals, but when it comes to mining in Greenland, they have shown no interest,\" he says.\n\"That leaves me with the concern that maybe it's not about security, maybe it's not about minerals, maybe it is just a question of expanding the territory of the United States.\n\"And that's actually a point where we are not able to accommodate President Trump.\"\nAdditional reporting by Kostas Kallergis",

But when it comes to ticket prices, there is unity.\n\"We are all fighting the same fight on ticket prices,\" said Manchester United Supporters' Trust CEO Duncan Drasdo.\n\"Clubs are exploiting loyalty and fans are united in saying enough is enough.\"\nWhen 19 of the Premier League's 20 clubs raised their ticket prices before the 2024-25 season, the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) launched a campaign called 'Stop Exploiting Loyalty'.\nThose protests have grown again this season, with some clubs removing concessionary discounts for the elderly and young people - and teams like Arsenal announcing increases for 2025-26.\nThe cost of competing for trophies, increasing operational expenses, and the threat of complying with financial regulations, have all been given as reasons for price hikes.\nBBC Sport has analysed a new Uefa report showing the league's financial power and how much clubs make from tickets - but also the challenge of increased staffing levels and expensive running costs.\nThis video can not be played\nArsenal fan Laura Kirk-Francis outlines her disappointment over ticket price hikes\nPremier League clubs made a total of almost 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) from selling tickets to home matches in 2023, Uefa's European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report shows.\nThat figure is growing by about 10% per year, and is almost double that of Spain's  La Liga (\u00a3481m) and Germany's Bundesliga (\u00a3430m).\nThe report uses a mixture of full financial reporting of more than 700 clubs for 2023, plus 2024 figures from 130 of Europe's biggest clubs.\nOf the 10 clubs who generated the most income from gate receipts in 2024, six are English.\nThe same six Premier League clubs feature in the top 12 for another ticketing metric, which measures the money earned per fan, per ticket.\n\"What the figures show is that English top-flight clubs are doing very well financially in a whole number of different metrics,\" says Tom Greatrex, chair of the FSA.\n\"Healthy ticket revenue shows people are wanting to go - but also shows the ratcheting up of ticket prices in the past few years. That is manifesting itself in the protests and disenchantment we've seen.\"\nThe report also points out that \"stadium expansions and/or increases in premium seating and hospitality have also doubled gate revenues at Paris St-Germain, Bayern [Munich], Liverpool and Manchester City since 2009\".\nArsenal and Tottenham's positions are helped by sales of high-value hospitality seats at modern stadiums in London - one of the world's most-visited cities.\n\"What we have seen clubs do through stadium expansion is a huge focus on those seats being hospitality,\" says Dan Plumley, senior lecturer in sport finance at Sheffield Hallam University. \n\"On a basic financial level it makes sense, because you can generate more from that than a baseline seat. \n\"But if that is stopping your more average fan getting a ticket, that is something clubs are going to have to grapple with.\"\nThe report states the average amount made per fan from tickets is \u00a329-\u00a337 \"for the majority of clubs\".\nFans from four rival clubs to protest at ticket prices\nMan Utd fans criticise ticket prices - as club reveals manager change costs\nPremier League ticket price rises - what the fans think\nThis video can not be played\nOne Manchester United fan explains why protests are planned\nThe Uefa report paints a similar picture to other research such as the annual Deloitte Money League - with Premier League clubs bringing in far more revenue  (\u00a36.2bn in 2023) than other European leagues.\nHowever, English clubs reported a combined loss of \u00a3728m before tax.\nTV rights deals are showing signs of plateauing, so clubs need to maximise matchday income and commercial and sponsorship revenues to try to offset significant spending on transfers, wages and running costs in order to turn a profit.\nThe report outlines some eye-watering spending figures:\nPremier League clubs spent \u00a34bn on player wages in 2023, almost double second-placed Spain (\u00a32.1bn).\nFour European clubs have squads that cost more than 1bn euros (\u00a3830m) to assemble by the end of 2024, and all are English - Chelsea (1.7bn euros/\u00a31.4bn), Manchester City (1.3bn euros/\u00a31.1bn), Manchester United (1.1bn euros/\u00a3920m), and Arsenal (1bn euros/\u00a3840m).\nChelsea's 2024 squad was found to be \"comfortably the most expensive ever assembled\", 24% higher than the previous record - the 2020 Real Madrid squad. The report also says Chelsea spent almost 2bn euros (\u00a31.7bn) in transfer fees in the five-year period to 2024.\nFour of the five most profitable clubs - by pre-tax profits - in 2024 were German: Bayern (\u00a353m), Borussia Dortmund (\u00a341m), Lazio (\u00a334m), Leipzig (\u00a331m), Eintracht Frankfurt (\u00a327m).\nThree of the five least profitable clubs in 2024 - by pre-tax losses - were English: Juventus (\u00a3164m), Chelsea (\u00a393m), Aston Villa (\u00a384m), Roma (\u00a363m), Liverpool (\u00a355m).\nPlumley says: \"Each individual club will have its own reasons for doing it, but raising ticket prices doesn't shift the dial massively in terms of the overall picture of the finances.\n\"I get that costs have gone up, we understand that side of the equation, but this is where it really grinds with fans.\"\nFans of some clubs have been contesting the loss of concessionary tickets for the elderly, juniors, and disabled supporters\nManchester United's controversial plans to make up to 450 redundancies,, external cut about 39% of its workforce and \"return the club to profitability\" have put a sharper focus on how many people are actually needed to run a football club - and the operating costs involved.\nWhile transfer spending remains a club's biggest outgoing, the report says high inflation in areas such as utilities, plus the wages spent on more employees to expand commercial activity, is biting. \nOperating costs have risen by 12% across Europe, with a total of \u00a31.5bn spent in the Premier League in 2023, almost \u00a3500m higher than second-placed Germany\nOperating costs plus non-player wages absorb just under half the revenue of big-five European league clubs\nIn 2024, six Premier League teams featured in the top 10 for money spent on operating costs.\n\"Operations costs have increased - that's fair,\" Greatrex says. \"But increasing ticket prices way beyond the level of inflation, year after year, which is what has started to happen with most clubs in the Premier League - and then trying to claim that PSR or financial fair play are the reason - is the clubs treating people as though they're idiots.\"\nSalaries paid to non-footballer staff members have also risen sharply.\nThe average top 20 club in Europe has 970 full-time employees - Barcelona have the most with 1,781\nFour Premier League teams have more than 1,000 full-time employees - Man Utd, Brighton, Liverpool and Man City\nPremier League clubs employed a total of 11,081 full-time employees by the end of 2023\nEnglish top-flight clubs paid a total of \u00a31bn in non-player wages in 2023. That total, which includes wages paid to staff members such as coaches, media departments and ticket office personnel, is more than twice that of second-placed Germany\nThere was 19% inflation on non-player wages across Europe in 2023 and for the biggest clubs, head coach wages rose on average 21% in 2024\nThat compares to a more modest average growth of 4.5% in player wages in 2024, which the report said was \"essential for financial stability as clubs struggle with strong inflation\".\nThe logic behind the rise in staffing numbers varies per club. Brighton, for example, employ a notoriously vast recruitment and scouting operation.\nThe report states that employee growth can be explained by clubs' desire to wring more from commercial and sponsorship deals.\nAcross Europe, income from commercial and sponsorship deals has risen by 39% since 2019.\n\"Commercial income is almost untapped in terms of potential and there is no restriction on the number of deals you can sign,\" Plumley says. \n\"But you have to throw more resource at that.\n\"There are more roles now in football clubs than ever before. Some of them are quite forward thinking.\n\"It's a natural consequence of how the game has evolved, because everyone is pushing for growth, growth, growth.\"",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has hit China with a second tariff in as many months, which means imports from there now face a levy of at least 20%.\nThis is his latest salvo against Beijing, which already faces steep US tariffs, from 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles to 15% on clothes and shoes. \nTrump's tariffs strike at the heart of China's manufacturing juggernaut - a web of factories, assembly lines and supply chains that manufacture and ship just about everything, from fast fashion and toys to solar panels and electric cars.\nChina's trade surplus with the world rose to a record $1tn (\u00a3788bn) in 2024, on the back of strong exports ($3.5tn), which surpassed its import bill ($2.5tn).\nIt has long been the world's factory - it has thrived because of cheap labour and state investment in infrastructure ever since it opened its economy to global business in the late 1970s. \nSo how badly could Trump's trade war hurt China's manufacturing success?\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.\nMost tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods, and it's generally the importer who pays them.\nSo, a 10% tariff means a product imported to the US from China worth $4 would face an additional $0.40 charge applied to it.\nIncreasing the price of imported goods is meant to encourage consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead, thus helping to boost their own economy's growth.\nTrump sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. But economic studies of the impact of tariffs which Trump imposed during his first term in office, suggest the measures ultimately raised prices for US consumers.\nTrump has said his most recent tariffs are aimed at pressuring China to do more to stop the flow of the opioid fentanyl to the US. \nHe also imposed 25% tariffs on America's neighbours Mexico and Canada, saying its leaders were not doing enough to crack down on the cross-border illegal drug trade.\nYes, analysts say. \nExports have been the \"saving grace\" of China's economy and if the taxes linger,  exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third, Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's analytics, told the BBC. \nThe sheer value of China's exports - which account for a fifth of the country's earnings - means that a 20% tariff could weaken demand from overseas and shrink the trade surplus. \n\"The tariffs will hurt China,\" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong, told the BBC. \"They really need to do much more. They need to do what Xi Jinping has already said - boost domestic demand.\"\nThat is a tall task in an economy where the property market is slumping and disillusioned youth are struggling to find high-paying jobs. \nChinese people have not been spending enough to recharge the economy - and Beijing has just announced a slew of stimulus measures to boost consumption.\nWhile tariffs can slow Chinese manufacturing, they cannot stop or replace it that easily, analysts say.\n\"Not only is China the big exporter, it is sometimes the only exporter like for solar panels. If you want solar panels you can only go to China,\" Ms Garcia-Herrero said.\nChina had begun pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such  as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) long before Trump became president. And that has given China an \"early mover\" advantage, not to mention the scale of production in the world's second-largest economy.\nChinese factories can produce high-end tech in large quantities at a low cost, said Shuang Ding, chief China economist at Standard Chartered.\n\"It's really difficult to find a replacement... China's status as a market leader is very difficult to topple.\"\nChina has responded with counter tariffs of 10-15% on US agricultural goods, coal, liquefied natural gas, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars.\nAnd it has targeted US firms in aviation, defence and tech with export restrictions and announced an anti-monopoly investigation against Google.\nChina has also spent years adapting to tariffs from Trump's first term. Some Chinese manufacturers have moved factories out of the country, for instance. And supply chains have come to rely more on Vietnam and Mexico by exporting from there to bypass the tariffs.         \nAnd yet, Trump's recent  tariffs on Mexico would not hurt China too much because  Vietnam is a bigger backdoor for Chinese goods, Ms Garcia-Herrero said.\n\"Vietnam is the key here. If tariffs are imposed on Vietnam, I think it will be very tough,\" she said.\nWhat concerns China more than tariffs, analysts says, is US restrictions on advanced chips. \nThese restrictions have been a major sticking point between the two countries but they have also fuelled China's determination to invest in homegrown tech that is independent of the West.  \nIt's why Chinese AI firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm had reportedly stockpiled Nvidia chips before the US began cutting off China's access to the most advanced ones.  \nAlthough this could \"impact China's competitiveness, I don't think that would affect China's status as a manufacturing power,\" Mr Ding of Standard Chartered said.\nOn the other hand, any ground China gains in advanced tech manufacturing will  boost its high-value exports. \nIt happened because of state support, an unrivalled supply chain and cheap labour, analysts say.\n\"The combination of globalisation, as well as China's pro-business policies and market potential, helped to attract the initial wave of foreign investors,\" Chim Lee, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told the BBC.\nThe government then doubled down, investing heavily in building a sprawling network of roads and ports to bring in raw materials and take Chinese-made goods to the world. What also helped was a stable exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar.   \nA shift in recent years towards advanced tech has made sure that it will continue to be relevant and ahead of its competitors, analysts say.\nChina already has plenty of economic clout from being a manufacturing powerhouse. But there is also a political opportunity as Trump's tariffs upend America's relationship with the world. \n\"The door is ajar for China to position itself as an advocate of free trade and a stable global force,\" said Mr Cruise of Moody's.\nBut that is not easy, given Beijing has been accused of flouting international trade norms, such as imposing a tariff of more than 200% on imports of Australian wine in 2020.\nAnalysts say China must also look beyond the US, which is still the top destination for its exports. China is the third-biggest market for US exports, after Canada and Mexico. \nChinese trade with Europe, South East Asia and Latin America has been growing, but it's hard to imagine that the world's two biggest economies can stop relying on each other.

        "article_text": "Forty years ago, Northern English poet Harrison published a powerful work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds. Then, when it was screened on TV in 1987, a national furore erupted.\n\"FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY\" thundered the front page of one British newspaper, condemning the \"cascade of expletives\". \"FROM BAD TO VERSE\" was the headline of another article, that quoted a Conservative Member of Parliament questioning whether the said poem \"serves any artistic purpose whatsoever\". And a group of particularly exercised MPs called for a debate in the House of Commons.\nThe furore was about a poem called V by northern English poet Tony Harrison \u2013 a work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds \u2013 which was originally published in January 1985, but really became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre when it was screened on national television in the UK two years later, in November 1987.\nIt is not often a poem becomes a hot topic of conversation among the general public. The last time it happened was four years ago when Amanda Gorman read her poem The Hill We Climb at Joe Biden's presidential inauguration, although the poet's youth and outfit excited as much comment as her verse. Before that, it was WH Auden's Funeral Blues, after it featured in the hit 1994 romcom Four Weddings and a Funeral.\u00a0\nBut if it is unusual for a poem to escape the confines of the world of literature, it's virtually unheard of for one to provoke angry newspaper headlines, and prompt politicians to demand action and members of the public to furiously call TV channels.\u00a0\nV had its origins in a visit by Harrison to Holbeck Cemetery in Beeston, Leeds, in May 1984. The cemetery stands on a hill \u2013 beneath which there are worked-out mine seams \u2013 and overlooks both Elland Road, home of Leeds United Football Club, and the University of Leeds, where Harrison, a poet and playwright, had studied Classics and Linguistics. Harrison, there to tend his parents' graves, found the cemetery strewn with beer cans and gravestones defaced by spray-painted graffiti \u2013 four-letter words, racist abuse, swastikas and a series of \"V\" letters. The nature of some of the graffiti suggested football fans were responsible.\nAt this time, unemployment was soaring, and went on to reach 11.9% later that year, a level not seen in the UK since 1971 \u2013 and not seen since. The previous year, an award-winning BBC drama, The Boys from the Blackstuff, about unemployed tarmac-layers in Liverpool, had captured the zeitgeist and made a huge impact. The Miners' Strike had started some weeks earlier. In fact, the country was deeply divided under a polarising Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher. In the vandalism and the spray-painted daubings, Harrison saw further evidence of societal division, and it gave him the idea for his poem.\nHarrison was, at this point, an established and well-respected poet, playwright and translator. He had published several volumes of verse and been the resident dramatist at the National Theatre, while his 1973 translation of Moli\u00e8re's The Misanthrope had won great acclaim.\nOn 24 January 1985, V was published in the London Review of Books.\nIt consists of 112 four-line stanzas, or quatrains, with an ABAB rhyming scheme, the same form as Thomas Gray's celebrated 18th-Century poem Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, which Harrison sought to evoke in contrast with his own work.\nThe \"V\" of the title stands for \"versus\" \u2013 which is also a pun on \"verses\" \u2013 but maybe also for \"victory\", and perhaps it is further intended to refer to the two-fingered \"V sign\" gesture considered rude in British culture.\nOne verse reads:\nThese Vs are all the versuses of life\nfrom LEEDS v. DERBY, Black/White\nand (as I've known to my cost) man v. wife, \nCommunist v. Fascist, Left v. Right.\nThe poem imagines the poet engaging in a dialogue with the person who has defaced the graves, and it features the obscenities and racist epithets used in the graffiti.\n\"We didn't need Harrison to tell us then that Britain was divided, and we don't now, but\u00a0V was a powerful articulation of those divisions and some of their causes,\" says Sandie Byrne, Professor of English at the University of Oxford.\u00a0\n\"The football supporter who, taking a shortcut through the cemetery, takes out his rage on the gravestones, is treated sympathetically, albeit with aggressive language to match his own. The Harrison figure understands the frustration of the third-generation unemployed among headstones celebrating lifelong professions.\n\"The poem's power and endurance come from its energy, the impetus of the verse and the language, its anger, and its use of the personal in the service of the political.\"\nV did not appear to cause any outrage when first printed in the London Review of Books. It was subsequently published in book form by Bloodaxe Books in November 1985 and, again, troubled neither the UK's legislature nor its newspapers.\u00a0Neil\u00a0Astley, founder of Bloodaxe Books, and still the publisher's editor and managing director, recalls that, soon after the publication of the poem as a book, \u00a0Harrison performed the entire thing in a late-night arts slot on Tyne Tees Television, which catered specifically to audiences in North East England, and \"it went out without arousing any opposition as far as I'm aware\".\nBut then in 1987, it became known that a televised version of the poem had been made for national broadcaster Channel 4, directed by celebrated theatre director Richard Eyre and featuring Harrison reading the poem along with footage of, among other things, striking miners, Holbeck Cemetery and Thatcher doing a \"victory\" sign. At that point, all hell broke loose.\nIn October, a few weeks before its broadcast, the Daily Mail reported on the \"FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY\" on its front page. The activist and anti-obscenity campaigner Mary Whitehouse called the poem a \"work of singular nastiness\". Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth, who earlier that year had attempted to introduce legislation that would make it a crime to air material that might cause \"gross offence\" to a \"reasonable person\", was another who opposed its broadcast. He officially called for a debate in the House of Commons to try to stop it. One hundred and twenty one MPs signed the proposal. Howarth later admitted he had not read the poem in full. Harrison recalled in the 2013 BBC Radio 4 documentary, Exploring V, that at the height of the furore, a reporter from the Telegraph knocked on his door. \"I said, 'Have you read the poem?'\u2019 He said,'No. I'm New'.\"\nOpposition to the TV programme came principally from right wing commentators but the Sunday Telegraph columnist and editor of the Literary Review, Auberon Waugh, whom no-one had ever mistaken for a left winger, found the poem \"well written and extremely moving\", as he wrote in his Telegraph column at the time. Ian Hislop, the editor of UK satirical magazine Private Eye, wrote an article defending it in The Listener, as did Bernard Levin in the Times, calling it \"powerful, profound and haunting\". And the Independent printed the whole poem in its news pages, with an introduction by Blake Morrison in which he wrote: \"Those MPs are right to believe that the poem is shocking but not because of its language. It shocks because it describes unflinchingly what is meant by a divided society, because it takes the abstractions we have learned to live with \u2013 unemployment, racial tension, inequality, deprivation \u2013\u00a0and gives them a kind of physical existence on the page.\"\nThe film was broadcast at 11pm on Channel 4 on Wednesday 4 November 1987. According to the logs of the Channel 4 staff on the switchboard \u2013 which were reproduced in the appendix of Bloodaxe's second edition of the poem, along with many of the newspaper and magazine articles about the furore \u2013 there were several calls from viewers irate at the \"disgusting language\". But others approved. Mr K of Watford suggested \"politicians should address their energies into the social problems featured in the poem\". Mr W of London said: \"I am so moved the tears are running down my cheeks\". The majority of calls were in favour of the broadcast.\n\"The irony is, of course, that while Bloodaxe had sold a couple of thousand copies of the poem before 1987, as a result of the attacks on the Channel 4 film, V reached an audience of millions who might otherwise never have heard of it,\" Astley tells the BBC. \"And if you read the poem today, it feels every bit as vital and relevant as it was 40 years ago.\"\nSandie Byrne says: \"I remember friends reading about the poem in the press, and assuming that it was just a meretricious piece studded with swear words by a shock jock seeking attention. Others picked up that it mentioned [miners' leader] Arthur Scargill, and showed scenes of the miners' strike, and assumed that those were its only subjects. Even among those who actually read it, the poem seemed to revive ideas about appropriateness in poetic diction that one would have thought long dead.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The 'obscene' book that became a bestseller\n\u2022 Why did Jane Austen's sister burn her letters?\n\u2022 40 of the most exciting books to read in 2025\n\"What was unexpected and possibly shocking about\u00a0V,\" Byrne tells the BBC, \"was less the dialogue that represented a young football supporter swearing \u2013 what a surprise \u2013 and more the use of iambic pentameter quatrains, at a time when closely patterned, regular verse was regarded as outmoded, an unfitting vehicle for modern concerns. The transplantation of Gray's elegy from a small country churchyard to a large urban cemetery, the use of ellipses, slang, ordinary speech and Northern pronunciation perhaps suggested that poetry wasn't a sleepy dusty backwater, or necessarily couched in prissy, posh Southern or elaborate language.\"\nThe poem was once again broadcast in its entirety on Radio 4 in 2013. Although the press anticipated controversy, there was actually little fuss. Perhaps listeners had become more used to four-letter words being used in all sorts of media. The racist epithets would have if anything, been considered even more offensive in 2013 than when the Channel 4 film was broadcast. The half-hour Radio 4 documentary that was aired before the reading of the poem that contextualised the swear words and slurs must have helped listeners understand their use in the work.\nBoth poet and poem are now an accepted part of the literary canon. The website of the Poetry Foundation, a well-respected US organisation set up to promote poetry, describes Harrison as \"Britain's leading poet-playwright\", and says that V remains his \"most famous poem\". But while V's power to shock may have been somewhat diminished, it has lost none of its ability to engage and move the reader.\nThe full text of Tony Harrison\u2019s V can be read on the London Review of Books website. Warning: it contains swear words and highly offensive racial slurs\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

There's no heroes at training.\n\"I've taken a few so you build up a bit of belief that if it's in that area, you have a chance. \n\"I've dropped plenty of them as well but, ultimately, if you push yourself to the limit, you're going to find where it is.\"\nIndia beat New Zealand in the group stage of the Champions Trophy but one of the highlights of the match was Phillips' catch to dismiss Virat Kohli\nWhen you sit with Phillips his attributes are obvious. \nBulging forearms, broad shoulders, huge thighs and a stocky frame all help him cover ground at speed, throw and leap from a low centre of gravity. He has also spoken about embracing being diagnosed with ADHD. \nBut Phillips, who was born in South Africa before moving to New Zealand with his family aged five, is not happy to settle with what he has been given physically. \nThe 28-year-old is a studier of the mechanics of fielding. He watches the NFL and, in particular, baseball for theories of how he can push those limits.\nHe practises throwing with his non-dominant left arm and tests different ways to collect the ball in the field, like picking up with his left hand and throwing with his right and vice versa to maintain momentum through the ball.\n\"In baseball, it's significantly quicker to pick it up on the move on your mitt side, carry on through the ball and then throw,\" Phillips says. \n\"Obviously that provides a lot of momentum and power. That becomes slightly difficult when you've got bare hands.\n\"I'm yet to find out whether there is actually a difference in it. I've used it in a game a couple of times and it's felt really cool.\"\nThose that know Phillips describe him as one of those people that is good at everything. \nElectric in the field, he is also a hard-hitting batter, bowls canny off-spin and has even been wicketkeeper at international level, something he has now stopped because \"there was no ability to move, no running, no diving and no ability to do something special unless the ball comes your way in your one specific spot\".\nPhillips has also taken up archery, which he believes helps his cricket.\n\"The element that I've taken out of that is being more process driven,\" he says.\n\"Obviously, baseball, I've seen the fielding element of it. Golf, the real patience side of things. \n\"But then archery is a real process-driven sport where if you focus on trying to hit the target, it often doesn't really work. \n\"If you focus on doing the things that you can do well, that being the process, the end result takes care of itself.\"\nPhillips believes New Zealand's fielding gives them \"an edge in big tournaments\" - they have reached a fourth men's white-ball final since 2015 here - but is also able to see the big picture when showing off his art.\n\"If it's a little thing I can do to give back to the cricket community and inspire the next generation to enjoy fielding rather than wanting to just sit on the sidelines and just bat and bowl, I think that's something that I'd be really happy to come out of this game with one day,\" Phillips says.\nPhillips hopes to be flying the skies after retirement. Perhaps others will follow his lead on the field.",

        "article_text": "Twenty billion disposable menstrual products are discarded each year in the US. There's a huge array of reusable options, from pads to pants to menstrual cups. Ana Santi explores which is the most sustainable and how safe they are.\nDuring a weekend away with my girlfriends a few years ago, one of them mentioned that she was wearing period pants, an environmental decision to move away from single-use pads and tampons. I'd vaguely heard of them, but didn't know anyone who wore them and I'd always been a little sceptical \u2013 would they be absorbent enough? My friend convinced me otherwise and they've remained my product of choice ever since. But as I browse the shelves of menstrual products in my local supermarket today, I'm overwhelmed by the choice available: so many pads and tampons (some organic, most not), numerous types of cups, a few period pants.\nAnd still, 49 billion single-use period products are used every year in Europe alone. In the US, it's about 20 billion discarded each year, generating 240,000 tonnes of solid waste. Globally, disposable sanitary pads \u2013 which can contain up to 90% plastic and end up largely in landfill \u2013\u00a0are the most commonly used menstrual product.\nI set out to find the most sustainable period product available.\nGiven that 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate every month, a group of academics based in France and the US conducted a life-cycle assessment of menstrual products across four product groups: disposable non-organic and organic pads and tampons (with applicators); reusable pads; period underwear; and menstrual cups, which are made from soft, flexible silicone or rubber and can hold 20-30ml (around two tablespoons) of menstrual blood. Comparing eight environmental impact indicators \u2013 global warming potential, fossil resources, land use, water use, carcinogenic effects, ecotoxicity, acidification and eutrophication \u2013 and conducted over one year across three countries (France, India and the US), the assessment considers impacts from production to disposal.\nAcross all the three countries and environmental impacts, the menstrual cup was a clear winner, followed by period underwear, reusable pads and, in last place, single-use pads and tampons. Small and lightweight, one person's menstrual cup can last up to 10 years.\nDisposable pads \u2013 both organic and non-organic \u2013 had the highest impacts across all eight categories except water use, with non-organic pads scoring the highest for global warming potential and resource depletion. The global warming potential \u2013 greenhouse gas emissions' ability to absorb heat and warm the atmosphere over a given time period \u2013 came from manufacturing, with almost half of the impact from production of polyethylene (a petroleum-based plastic). But one of the most surprising results \u2013 not least to the report's authors \u2013 was that organic cotton pads had the highest impact of all, across five categories.\n\"The impacts are mostly linked to raw material manufacturing and organic production, which can have higher environmental impacts,\" explains M\u00e9lanie Douziech, one of the study's co-authors from Mines Paris-PSL university. The yield of organic farming is lower than conventional farming, meaning more water and land is needed to produce the same amount of organic as conventional cotton. Similar results were found for organic and non-organic cotton tampons.\nDepending on the product, different parts of the lifecycle influence the emissions. \"For disposable products, it's the raw material production and manufacturing, as a lot of these products have plastics in them, which have quite a large global warming impact,\" says Douziech. \"With reusable products, it is the manufacturing and use phases, especially the electricity requirements.\"\nWater and electricity are needed to wash all reusable products between wear, but period pants perform better than reusable pads, in part because otherwise another form of underwear would be worn \u2013 and washed \u2013 regardless. \"Even though the menstrual cup is a clear winner, period underwear is also an alternative product that really reduces the environmental impacts,\" says Douziech. How we care for them can also affect the overall impact, such as washing at lower temperatures and as part of a full load.\nThe assessment did not consider plastic pollution, but according to the study each conventional pad, including wrappers, wings and adhesives, adds some 2g of non-biodegradable plastic \u2013 the equivalent of four plastic bags \u2013 to the environment and take an estimated 500 to 800 years to decompose. The study adds that, in the US, 80% of conventional tampons and 20% of conventional pads are flushed down toilets, blocking sewers and releasing microplastics into oceans.\nPrior to this report, an analysis of several life-cycle analyses comparing the environmental impacts of menstrual products, including emissions and resource depletion, was commissioned by the UN Environment Programme in 2021. Co-author Philippa Notten, director of the Cape Town-based non-profit TGH Think Space, which focuses on energy, climate change and sustainability projects, says that, due to a lack of data, the impact of plastic at menstrual products' end of life is not well documented in life-cycle assessments. \"Plastic tends to get modelled as if it ends up in a landfill or incinerator. Counterintuitively, landfill actually looks good from a carbon footprint point of view because plastic takes hundreds of years to degrade, so those carbon emissions are locked up in the landfill, which acts like a carbon sink,\" she says. \"In reality, the product doesn't always end up in a formal waste management stream; it ends up as litter on beaches, as microplastics in the sea. And there is still a lot of carbon in the production of plastics.\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Seven proven ways to help the planet in 2025\n\u2022 Why a bamboo toothbrush isn't always greener\n\u2022 Is it better to buy in bulk?\nIn UNEP's report, the menstrual cup also comes out on top by a considerable margin. \"It's quite rare for this to happen to a product,\" Notten says. \"It's not that the cup doesn't have a carbon footprint, but because it's such a small, light product, the impact is also small relative to other products.\"\n\"We always talk about 'break even points' in these studies: how many times do you have to use a renewable product before it has made up for the emissions caused in its manufacturing and use phases, compared to a single-use product?\" Notten says. \"For many products, it's often really high, like 100 times. With a menstrual cup, you only have to use it for a month before it breaks even on its carbon footprint.\"\nBoth studies express the importance of context and highlight that greenhouse gas emissions are only one of the many consequences of products and processes. \"No matter what we do, we are going to have an impact, but the idea is to minimise this impact as much as possible,\" says Paula P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez, co-author of the France and US study and a researcher at Mines Paris-PSL university.\nThe life-cycle assessment recommends that women consider factors beyond environmental impact, including social and cultural attitudes and infrastructures. \"This was out of our field of environmental assessment expertise, but in some African countries, reusable products, in particular menstrual cups, could be the difference between going to school and not for some girls, who don't have access to a period product,\" says P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez. \"Of course, the problem of access extends to all kinds of products, but a menstrual cup could be much easier to access because it's a small product that lasts a long time.\"\nBut recent reports have warned of the consequences of a poorly fitted, incorrectly sized menstrual cup, with one woman developing temporary kidney problems and some women suffering from pelvic organ prolapse. Shazia Malik, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Portland Hospital in London, is reluctant to recommend menstrual cups to teenagers unless they are carefully taught how to use and care for them. \"In the last eight years, I've seen patients \u2013 women and teenagers \u2013 who use menstrual cups develop infections,\" she says. \"If you don't insert [the cup] properly, it can compress the bladder or rectum, and it won't effectively collect menstrual blood.\"\nMalik also warns of the dangers of using the same menstrual cup for many years. Her advice is to have two cups on the go, sterilise them after each use \u2013 including every morning and night \u2013 and to replace them as soon as there is any wear and tear. \"We also need more awareness on choosing the right menstrual cup size, depending on your flow and whether you've had a vaginal birth. With education, the menstrual cup is a fantastic period product,\" Malik says.\nIn the UK, the Women's Environmental Network, a non-profit, is calling for a Menstrual Health, Dignity and Sustainability Act to combat period poverty, environmental waste and toxic chemicals found in period products. WEN cites a new policy in the Spanish region of Catalonia as an example to follow. From March 2024 all women in Catalonia were given access to free, reusable menstrual products.\nAmong the network's concerns is a US study that detected 16 types of metals, including lead, in tampons, and a report by Which?, a UK consumer magazine, which found \"unnecessarily high levels of silver\" in some period pants, used as an antimicrobial agent to combat concerns about smell and hygiene.\nHelen Lynn, a campaign manager focusing on the environmental impacts of menstrual products at WEN, says that such chemicals are harmful to human health and the environment, with innovation happening faster than regulation. \"[The life-cycle assessment] is an interesting study but it doesn't take into account chemical residues and additives in menstrual products because businesses aren't obliged to disclose them, so studies like these can only look at the main materials disclosed by manufacturers,\" she says. \"A lack of transparency means that people don't know what's in these products and they put them next to a very absorbent part of the body.\"\nSome legislative progress is being made, with Europe leading the way. In September 2023, the European Commission established a new EU Ecolabel criteria for absorbent hygiene products and reusable menstrual cups, awarded to products that fulfil limit environmental impacts along their lifecycle. In Nordic countries, the Nordic Swan Ecolabel, which promotes resource efficiency, reduced climate impact, a non-toxic circular economy and conservation of biodiversity, is currently in a consultation period to revise the criteria of its sanitary products.\nIn 2024, Vermont became the first US state to adopt a new law to ban the \"forever chemicals\" PFAs in menstrual products, while a bill\u00a0led by New York congresswoman Grace Meng calls for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study the make-up of menstrual products.\nMarina Gerner, professor at New York University's Stern School of Business and author of The Vagina Business, would welcome a US equivalent to the EU Ecolabel, but is calling for a global initiative. \"Companies need to disclose the ingredients of their period products and toxic ingredients need to be banned by regulators,\" Gerner says. \"The reason this hasn't happened yet is because women's health has historically been under researched and underfunded. The modern tampon was invented in 1931 and the first study on metal levels in tampons was only published last year.\"\nSeveral years ago, I switched to mostly using period pants. They last between two to three years and cost about \u00a345 ($56.7) for three pairs. At approximately \u00a32.75 ($3.48) for a pack of 10 pads, and using two packs per month, I would have spent up to \u00a3200 ($252.7) on pads in the same period. A menstrual cup is approximately \u00a320 ($25.2) and, for people comfortable using tampons, it is relatively easy to insert, but removal, cleansing and re-insertion when away from home or in public toilets can make it less accessible.\nAs a regular swimmer, I plan to try period swimwear next, although the possibility of leakage makes me anxious (I've been assured by people who wear them that this doesn't happen). Even though the life-cycle assessment ranked disposable organic products as the worst environmental offender, on occasions when period pants aren't convenient, I use a disposable, organic cotton, plastic-free and compostable brand that you can discard in your food bin (it is readily available in supermarkets and health stores). P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez says that the study did not model composting at end-of-life. \"This would need to be investigated further.\"\u00a0\nWhen trying to make better environmental choices, it is rare to find a relative silver bullet, like the menstrual cup. But I think that most people who are in a position to choose their menstrual products would prefer a range of options. \"And that is a great solution,\" says P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez. \"Choose a reusable product when you can, but if you're uncomfortable using a certain type of product for your whole cycle, or you can't rely on a reusable product for a particular reason, combine several products. You will still be making a difference.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

With education, the menstrual cup is a fantastic period product,\" Malik says.With a menstrual cup, you only have to use it for a month before it breaks even on its carbon footprint \u2013 Philippa NottenIn the UK, the Women's Environmental Network, a non-profit, is calling for a Menstrual Health, Dignity and Sustainability Act to combat period poverty, environmental waste and toxic chemicals found in period products. Globally, disposable sanitary pads \u2013 which can contain up to 90% plastic and end up largely in landfill \u2013\u00a0are the most commonly used menstrual product.I set out to find the most sustainable period product available.Given that 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate every month, a group of academics based in France and the US conducted a life-cycle assessment of menstrual products across four product groups: disposable non-organic and organic pads and tampons (with applicators); reusable pads; period underwear; and menstrual cups, which are made from soft, flexible silicone or rubber and can hold 20-30ml (around two tablespoons) of menstrual blood. Comparing eight environmental impact indicators \u2013 global warming potential, fossil resources, land use, water use, carcinogenic effects, ecotoxicity, acidification and eutrophication \u2013 and conducted over one year across three countries (France, India and the US), the assessment considers impacts from production to disposal.Across all the three countries and environmental impacts, the menstrual cup was a clear winner, followed by period underwear, reusable pads and, in last place, single-use pads and tampons. \"Even though the menstrual cup is a clear winner, period underwear is also an alternative product that really reduces the environmental impacts,\" says Douziech.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'No one wanted to give me a chance' - Gonzalez Quintero\nOn the streets they call him 'Kego'. The one-time wonderkid left to train alone in a concrete wilderness of city towerblock staircases. A cage footballer for hire, a pick-up game artist on speed dial. The embers of his professional dream still flickering in a footballing underworld.\nKevin Gonzalez Quintero was once Jude Bellingham's England room-mate, played in the same youth teams as Jamal Musiala and Harvey Elliott and was the guy a young Jhon Duran would ask for boots.\n\"Jude, he is a great lad,\" remembers Kego. \"He is very chill, a great person on and off the pitch. You can see why he is where he is today. Since that very young age he has had that leadership. Very mature.\"\nHis father once played for Deportivo Cali, but Kego's parents packed up and left a Colombia that he says was in the grip of Pablo Escobar and the nation's drug cartels to swap South America for a new life in south London before he was born.\nThat allowed Kego to shine in front of Crystal Palace scouts, joining the Eagles aged eight and later winning their academy player of the year.\nAfter a decade with Palace he believed he was destined for the Premier League and life on the international stage. As well as England, Kego represented Colombia at youth level.\n\"It was a dream,\" he says. \"I always wanted to play for Colombia. Duran was there with me. He is a funny guy.\n\"He has always been good, but he wasn't banging in goals like that. Which shows his dedication, his time. It worked out for him. I'm very happy for him, too. He deserves it, I saw how hard it was for him.\n\"I remember him asking me for football boots. Just seeing him now is like 'wow, you have grown so much and I am proud of you, man'.\"\nThose players have gone on to represent some of the world's biggest clubs - Bellingham at Real Madrid, Musiala at Bayern Munich and Elliott at Liverpool, while former Aston Villa striker Duran is making his fortune in Saudi Arabia.\nBut for Kego, it didn't work out like that. \nHe was released by Palace at 18 and, via false dawns and broken promises, spent four years travelling the world, trialling in 14 different countries, yearning for a professional contract.\n\"I thought I was going to have the world at my feet,\" says the now 22-year-old. \"I played with Colombia, I played with England. I was at Palace for 10 years. I was pretty sure I'd get a club, easily, but then I got exposed to the real world, quickly.\"\nJamal Musiala and Kego on England youth team duty\nSo what went wrong for Kego at Crystal Palace? He was offered an extension, he says, but it did not materialise. \n\"I got different advice that I shouldn't have listened to,\" recalls Kego. \"Two months later, they just told me 'Look, Kevin, we're not going to guarantee you any game time for next year, you're better off looking for other teams. You're a very good player, we believe you can start your professional career elsewhere'.\n\"I was very down, 10 years here and then just like that, gone.\n\"A few agents, they lied to me. Saying 'listen, we have got this club for you and this club'. They sell you the world. But when it came to the time, nothing happened. That was really upsetting.\"\nHe was caught in a spiral of failed trials and wasted journeys - Hungary, Spain, even Brazil.\n\"Before you know it, you're six months without a club, then a year, then it carries on going,\" adds Kego. \"They start questioning your ability. Often I heard from clubs 'Oh, but he's been out for six months, oh, two years now'.\n\"Then when I did get the chance, I would be so mentally drained, to the point I couldn't focus. And when I was there, there would be another agent telling me 'listen, I've got you a first-team game'.\n\"I went to another team in Spain. The agent sorted the travel and everything, but when I got there, he blocked me. I didn't hear from him again and I was left stranded.\"\nAt the same time, his mum became seriously ill and needed the support of Kego and his father. \n\"Seeing your mum, the person that raised you, when she's ill, that kills you as a son,\" he says. \"She is still recovering, she has days that are good and days that are bad. We are getting there.\"\nKego with Xavi Simons, now of RB Leipzig and the Netherlands, after a youth match against Barcelona\nKego with the Colombia Under-17s squad\n1 of 2\nTo stay prepared for an opportunity, Kego would train relentlessly on his own.\n\"It almost felt like a prison cell,\" he explains. \"You wake up, you train, you see the same surroundings over and over again. Four years, the same thing.\n\"I would wake up, I would see bricks, blocks. It's mad. Going from seeing grass, everything is cut for you, you have got new balls - now I am maybe playing with a flat football, playing with a tennis ball or a golf ball.\n\"It's called the towerblock in my area. Every day I would be running up the stairs, training with my dad. I would even go to the park, on an 11-a-side pitch, I would start passing the ball to imaginary team-mates and then I would go and chase after the ball myself. It wasn't easy, but you have to work with what you have.\"\nBut it was not just a physical battle. He could eat well and run until the sun came up - and friends say they would get calls at 4am to do just that - but mentally, with no end in sight, the churn was taxing.\n\"When you're not at a team you're getting frustrated because you know your talent, you know that you can do that, that you're a good player, you have played with the best before,\" says Kego. \"Mentally it is killing you.\"\nKego says he went \"deep inside my mind\". He tried new things - he practises Simran meditation and, as a Christian, studies the Bible and prays. \nBut he also found salvation on the streets, with a ball at his feet.\n\"Street football is what gives you that tempo,\" he beams. \"Short spaces. You have got to think quick. It really helped me. It gave me a lot of confidence. I was like 'you know what, if I can do it in this short space, imagine a bigger space'.\"\nKego built a reputation in cage tournaments and pick-up games, becoming renowned in street football circles and even earning a deal with Puma.\n\"Everyone knew if they wanted to win with style, call him,\" laughs Gundeep Anand, the founder of street football tournament The Last Stand.\nIt was in one such tournament Kego was spotted by Spanish side UD Ibarra, and suddenly the dream was revived.\nKego earned a glowing reputation on the street football scene, playing in tournaments such as The Last Stand \nDiego Maradona Jr is the head coach of Spanish side UD Ibarra, who play on the island of Tenerife\nIbarra, from Tenerife, play in the fifth tier but are pushing for promotion and showing ambition. They recently appointed Diego Maradona Jr as head coach.\n\"He passed the ball to me and I said 'what, wait, [it's like] his dad is passing the ball to me',\" Kego remembers of their first meeting on the training pitch. \"It's a bit mad. I was watching his dad's YouTube videos and then his son is passing the ball to me.\n\"The way they walk, they have a similar look. It's very motivating.\"\nThe forward is waiting to make his debut and Maradona Jr is keen to see the youngster kickstart his career in the Canary Islands.\n\"We needed a player like him,\" he says. \"Quick. Good technically, and had some experience in professional teams like Crystal Palace, the Colombian national team.\n\"He can bring speed to the game.  A player who can score many goals and who understands the game.\n\"We hope he can bring a different mentality that we are trying to change with the team and the club.\"\nKego describes joining Ibarra as \"relief\". Now, he says, \"it's time to shine\".\n\"I was buzzing, excited, very emotional as well,\" he adds.\n\"All these years of work, I would never have thought I would make it pro at 22. If I'm honest, I said let me just dedicate myself to playing street football.\"\nThat is one dream accomplished, but what comes next?\n\"I always think big,\" he smiles. \"Short term is smash it here, do my best, focus and try and get many goals and get the club promotion.\n\"Longer term... I want to be the best player in the world one day.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

Contacting a group designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US since 1997 represents a dramatic shift away from decades of US policy.\nThe Biden administration relied on intermediaries during its attempts to end the Gaza war. And Trump previously condemned Hamas for committing \"atrocities against humanity\" during its 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, calling its members \"vicious and violent\".\nBut for Trump, it seems, the old playbook wasn't working \u2013 and he was willing to risk appearing hypocritical, of bypassing US ally Israel, and of sitting down with a designated terror group to advance his deal-making goals.\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office responded with a terse statement, saying only that it had \"expressed its position\" on the talks.\nBy the end of the day, after meeting in the Oval Office with some previously released American hostages, Trump again turned up the heat on the group. He took to Truth Social to call it \"sick and twisted\" and issue a \"last warning\" that if members didn't release all the hostages there would be \"hell to pay\".\n\"I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job,\" he wrote, \"not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say.\"\nLaura Blumenfeld, a former senior Israeli-Palestinian policy adviser to the US state department, told the BBC that Trump's message to Hamas was an ultimatum.\n\"The deal, though, with these ultimatums is you have to deliver,\" she said, \"and we saw last month when Trump said you've got a high noon deadline on Saturday, release the hostages, or else, there was no or else.\n\"And Hamas called them out.

        "article_text": "From making history as Vogue's youngest-ever fashion editor to creating a gown fit for a Kennedy wedding \u2013 which would end up covered in grass stains \u2013 Vera Wang chronicles her career's surprising trajectory and shares some of her hard-won lessons as a woman at the top of her field.\nVera Wang may be best known for crafting some of the most memorable wedding gowns of all time. Mariah Carey, Victoria Beckham, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alicia Keys are just a few of the women who have chosen the designer for their big days. Less known is the fact that design wasn't her first foray into the fashion world\u2026 or even her second. Speaking to BBC special correspondent Katty Kay, on her sit-down series Influential, Wang shares her long journey, from working at US Vogue to having her own creations grace those same pages.\nSpeaking to Kay, Wang shares that \u2013 like a true drama \u2013 her life and career have been a series of acts, and that each act has included the ever-present spectre of time looming over her. As a teenager, the designer wanted to be an Olympic figure skater, but failed to make the cut. After that, she landed a position as fashion editor at Vogue right after graduating from Sarah Lawrence College, New York, making history in the process at the age of 23.\n\"I was the youngest, probably, woman to ever be given the title of editor. Probably to this day,\" Wang says.\nHer time at the magazine spanned 17 years, but like her time on the ice, Wang says that her skills didn't always match her passion. She didn't qualify for the 1968 Olympic Games in Grenoble and she never rose to the title of editor-in-chief.\n\"Some of the things I have adored the most, and by that, I mean passionately loved, are not fields I necessarily succeeded at,\" she says.\nIt wasn't until she was 40 years old, with Vogue and a position at Ralph Lauren behind her, that she launched her namesake fashion label. Bridal collections were just the beginning. Eventually, her brand would expand to include ready-to-wear, shoes, sunglasses, fine jewellery, home goods and even her own prosecco. Becoming too old for ice skating and the glossy world of magazines made Wang reassess what her next steps could be, even before she had the idea of putting her name on anything, much less everything.\n\"Women were considered transparent at a certain age, even in terms of their career,\" Wang says. \"You will age out of a career. I do not just mean modeling, I do not just mean being an editor,\" she adds, explaining to Kay that it takes a certain grit to outlast these supposed expiration dates. \"It is not about age, it is about style. And that is always how I felt. I have never not felt that way.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 'I was born to be an actor': Twice-knighted Derek Jacobi on nearly 70 years on the stage and screen\n\u2022 Misty Copeland is 'not scared' to face a career beyond dance\nWhen she decided to start with bridal gowns, Wang reflected on the approach to her own wedding. In 1989, Wang married investor Arthur P Becker (the two have since separated) and he had only one request of her for the ceremony.\n\"Please do not come in 'fashion'. Please look like a bride. [...] I want to make sure you look like a bride,\" Wang recalls him telling her.\nShe wouldn't be satisfied with simply following protocol. Blending her Chinese heritage into the ceremony, which was interfaith and drew from both Baptist and Jewish traditions, she inadvertently helped popularise the trend of brides slipping into a more festive look for their receptions.\n\"I got to change, because in Chinese culture, you change from the western [wedding] dress [into a] Chinese dress. But I changed into a party dress for afterwards. I started a trend way back in 1989, to change,\" Wang says.\nA tradition of the \"going-away\" outfit dates back to the 1930s. It was generally something more comfortable for brides to wear to bid goodbye to their guests before being whisked away on their honeymoons. Wang\u2019s choice to slip into something more festive has since become more widespread. High-profile brides \u2013 from the Princess of Wales (then the Duchess of Cambridge) and Princess Eugenie, to US actor Mandy Moore \u2013 frequently opt for a second dress for their evening reception.\nWhat she did with her wedding would come to mark Wang's go-to move of adding a dash of irreverence to the usually stuffy world of bridal fashion \u2013 something her clients could feel when they chose one of Wang's gowns.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"My first client was Ethel Kennedy. Her son, Max, was getting married and marrying a beautiful girl who was a law student. I spent eight months on that dress, and within 10 minutes of the ceremony, she was out kicking a football with the Kennedy brothers,\" Wang says.\nNow aged 75, Wang is well aware of her age, and that age is a topic of conversation around her. She tells Kay that she's noticed a shift in individuals being more critical of others and themselves today, a trend she blames on the rise of social media. Instead of focussing on how other people saw her as she grew older, Wang notes that as she has navigated the various acts of her career and life, she has focused on finding her passions and not what she saw in the mirror. This was a privilege, she reflects, of the era in which she was ageing.\n\"We did not have social media, and everybody did not age right before your very eyes, and everybody was not critical,\" she tells the BBC. \"It was really more about finding your way.\" Looking back at the 1990s and 2000s, she adds, \"I do not see that obsession with ageing that I have felt for the last two decades.\" Nevertheless, Wang's red carpet looks and social media posts prove that she's not shying away from the image that she cultivated over the years. She stays true to the sky-high platforms, micro-mini hemlines and long, lean silhouettes that have characterised her designs and personal appearances over the decades. She tells Kay that her age doesn't factor in how she gets dressed \u2013 and it never has.\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.\nFigures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.\nExperts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.\nBut the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.\n\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"\nMost UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases. \nWith home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.\nHeat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.\nAbout half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support. \nOne of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.\nEd Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.\n\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.\nIn its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.\nMr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive. \n\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.\nHe also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.\n\nDespite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.\nBut Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.\n\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.\nMadeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.\n\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.\nThis explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.\nMs Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.\nIn a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills. \n\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.\nAdditional reporting by Justin Rowlatt.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.\nBut the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.\nThe technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly. \nMask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?\nThe LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.\nAccording to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).\n\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.\n\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.\nA recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.\nUS space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.\nSince then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.\nBut at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.\nThe main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.\nDr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.\n\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.\n\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.\nSkincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.\nThis is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.\nDr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.\n\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.\n\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.\nWhen you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.\nNatalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.\nThe skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"\nShe adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.\nO'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.\n\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.\nPart of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.\nLaurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.\nHe started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.\n\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.\nNewman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.\nNewman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.\nHe emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.\nDr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.\n\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds. \n\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".\nHe says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.\nDr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",
