It's relatively similar to his peers in Europe (35.3 v 35) and Africa (35.7 v 31.5).\nCrucially, as well as the dozens of wickets he's taken in each country, he has an economy rate of less than six an over everywhere but in the West Indies (6.32).\nAnd while logic suggests his best years were under Morgan (141 wickets at 33), he actually has a better average, strike-rate and economy rate while playing for current captain Jos Buttler (59 at 27).\nIn England's most recent 3-0 defeat in India, Rashid was a cut above - taking seven wickets at 27, including that of Virat Kohli twice.\nYou see, Rashid is particularly good at taking down the opposition's star man...\nIn short, good.\nOf the four batters he has dismissed the most in ODIs, three can be considered among the best in their team: Steve Smith (Australia, seven wickets at 22), Mahmudullah (Bangladesh, five wickets at 18) and Kohli (India, five wickets at 22). The other one of the four is Marcus Stoinis (Australia, five wickets at 22).\nHe's taken the scalp of Pakistan's Babar Azam three times but has struggled against New Zealand's Kane Williamson (one wicket at 178). Williamson, his compatriot Ross Taylor and Sri Lanka's Dinesh Chandimal often come out on top against him.\nNot only does Williamson repel Rashid, he is good at dominating him - with his strike-rate of 123 only bettered by two men to have faced him in more than three innings: Mitchell Santner (New Zealand, 134) and Hardik Pandya (India, 130).\nWhen BBC Sport asked Rashid which batters he thought played him the best, he name-checked AB de Villiers of South Africa, Kohli, Babar, Williamson and West Indies' Andre Russell, Chris Gayle, Nicholas Pooran and Kieron Pollard.\nAsked for his favourite dismissals playing for England, he said: \"The Kohli wicket in an ODI at Headingley in 2018. It was a nice leg-spinner which pitched outside leg and hit the top of off.\"\nAdil Rashid, right, celebrates helping England win the 2019 World Cup - a competition in which he took 11 wickets in as many matches\nHow can one man dominate one format of cricket (OK, two!) but not the other (Test cricket)?\nIt's not for the want of trying on either Rashid's or England's part - in 19 Tests, he has taken 60 wickets at an average of almost 40.\nBut while leg-spin has become a key weapon in one-day cricket in the past 20 years, its influence in Test cricket has waned.\nIn the 2000s, when Rashid broke through at Yorkshire, more than 10% of all overs bowled in Test cricket were sent down by leggies. That has dropped to 3.7% in the current decade.\nWhen Rashid was called back into the Test team - he played 15 of his 19 Test matches between 2016 and 2018 - he wasn't the reliable bowler he is today.\nIn all formats in that period, he sent down a full toss or half-tracker 7% of the time. Between 2022 and 2024, bad deliveries - which come with the territory of being a leg-spinner more than most other bowling styles - were restricted to just 3%.\nGiven Test cricket allows batters time to wait for the bad delivery, Rashid could actually be a better option for the red-ball team now than when he first made his comeback.\nThat ship has seemingly sailed given Rashid's focus on white-ball cricket but the good news for England fans is that their premier wrist-spinner is still performing well and flourishing under Buttler's leadership. And when he takes two wickets or more in an ODI, England win 72% of the time.\nChuck him the ball, Jos.\nYour essential guide to the ICC Champions Trophy\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "In an old Welsh farmhouse a group of friends chatter and joke while tucking into a lunch of home-made soup and sourdough. \nBut behind this convivial scene a \"gnarly and unpleasant\" legal battle is underway.\nLast year, Brithdir Mawr - an 80-acre (32-hectare) farm in Newport, Pembrokeshire, that has been home to an off-grid community for the past 30 years - was sold to a new owner who plans to turn it into a retreat centre.\nThe community were issued with an eviction notice and some members left by the 31 December deadline, but others refused and are determined to remain. \nWill Cooke, who has lived with the community for four-and-a half years, said he hoped the adults who remained living on the site could come to an arrangement with the new owner that would work for all.\n\"There are no bad people in this situation, there are just many, many people trying their hardest to do the right thing and we've got into a glitch with each other,\" he said.\n\"I want us all to sit down with each other and try and straighten it out.\"\nBrithdir Mawr was established in 1993 by Julian Orbach with his then wife Emma and was originally part of a site of 160 acres (64 hectares).\nAfter the couple separated the site was split into two, with Emma establishing the neighbouring Tir Ysbrydol [Welsh for spiritual house] community and Mr Orbach remaining at Brithdir Mawr.\nIn 2002, he moved out but remained Brithdir Mawr's landlord. \nWhen Mr Orbach decided to sell, he said he \"very much\" wanted the community to continue and it was given first refusal to purchase the site. \nBut after the community's 10-year bid to raise the \u00a31m for the purchase, he sold the site last year to Rachel May, who is described as a shadow work and mindfulness coach, doula [offering help and support] and soul guide.\nShe has not responded to requests to be interviewed.\n\"We are aware that Rachel is our new owner, we are very aware of the fact that she's spent a large amount of money to do this, but the way in which she is wanting to bring about this process of change is completely out of alignment with who we are as a community,\" said Will.\n\"We've invited Rachel to come and visit with us several times, to come and negotiate with us to find a way forward that works for everyone.\" \nWill was a teacher and later worked for Extinction Rebellion UK before moving in with the community. \n\"I was expecting to spend two weeks here and I never left,\" he said. \n\"It's a really good fit for me, I get on really well here and feel like I'm valued and appreciated for who I am.\"\nThe community's members are dedicated to sustainable living. They keep goats - primarily to make cheese and occasionally for meat - as well as chickens, grow their own vegetables and manage the site's woodland.\nThe building runs off hydropower and a tiny wind turbine and is heated by a log burner. \nThey host weekly Welsh language classes, run workshops, open days and volunteer weeks to demonstrate their way of life.\nMany in the community have jobs away from the farm, they eat communally five times a week and, before the community's families left ahead of the eviction notice, the children were home-schooled.\nWill and the other members each pay rent as well as their contribution to \"food club\", bills, and a savings pot for expenses such as building repairs. \nWith no-one in charge, decisions are made collaboratively and their shared values include inclusivity, gratitude and valuing learning and culture. \nDoes living in this way come with the occasional conflict?\n\"There absolutely are difficulties at times,\" admitted Will.\n\"Occasionally conflicts happen... but there are far fewer than there are beautiful times.\"\nHe said the community tried to take blame out of conflict.\n\"A conflict for me is when we find a glitch in the way in which we're working, no-one's at fault,\" he said.\nHe said \"detangling\" conflicts when there was no-one in charge was \"very deep and intense work and often very painful, but by the end of it we find ourselves stronger, more beautiful, able to act with each other in a more beautiful way\".\nRosie Gilam, who grew up in nearby Cardigan, is Will's partner and spends about three days a week with him at Brithdir Mawr.\nShe has been visiting the community since she was a child and previously lived in communities in Cornwall. \n\"A major wonderful thing about being human is to accept others for what they are, understand they've got their own needs which might not intersect completely with your needs, and to come to a place where you're accepting of your differences and find a way to work together,\" she said.\n\"I think that is so needed on the planet at the moment.\" \nLike Will, she insisted \"nobody's to blame\" for the community's current predicament. \nShe said the situation was an example of \"broken systems\" which meant \"tenants don't have rights, a family can be turfed out of its home with little notice, and that people generally don't have affordable access to land\". \nShe hopes media attention on Brithdir Mawr will start a conversation about land rights and be \"one step towards systemic change\". \n\"So for example, there might be community right to buy, which means that a community like this in the future would have the right to buy an asset,\" she said.  \nAndromeda Gervasio, who is from Portugal, moved to the UK 12 years ago, and moved to Brithdir Mawr last summer after feeling burnt out with city life, \"craving a different lifestyle\" and being drawn to \"intentional community\".\n\"The water is the purest water I've ever drank, and the food is the best food I've ever eaten,\" they said.\n\"People are here not just because, there's a bigger purpose of really living together and sharing the work that it is to live and to live in a place like this... it's pretty incredible.\"\nThey said they cherished being accepted in the countryside. \n\"Being a queer person in the rural landscape has always been something that I was generally scared about... and then actually discovering it and feeling incredibly safe here, I've been so grateful... and I think that I owe lots to Brithdir in that regard,\" they said.\nLike the rest of their community, Andromeda insisted they did not feel animosity towards the new owner. \n\"We're not up against a particular person but a system and a normalised way of going about things,\" they said.\n\"Just because someone has the legal backing to do something, it doesn't necessarily make it okay or how the world should be.\n\"We have a history of things that were within legal bounds not corresponding to what is morally OK to do... [denying] women's rights, slavery and queer witch hunts were all legal at some point.\"\nFor now, what will happen next for the community is uncertain.  \n\"Essentially I feel really, really sad about it,\" said Rosie. \nShe lives in hope of all parties sitting down together and looking for a solution \"with an open heart\". \nWill is confident a resolution can be found.\n\"I don't know exactly what that would look like and that's OK,\" he said. \n\"This complexity and this difficulty feels very difficult, feels gnarly and unpleasant, but also I truly believe that something very special is happening.\n\"I look forward to this process continuing and resolving in a way that works for everyone in the near future.\"",

It was pretty sad.\"\nGatland left after a second spell in charge which brought just six victories in 26 Tests. \nDuring his first 12-year stint the New Zealander had won three Grand Slams, reached two World Cup semi-finals and took Wales briefly to the rop of the world rankings.\n\"Upon reflection, it's important to realise and appreciate what a massive and positive influence he was for Welsh rugby over the years,\" added Wainwright.\n\"I made my Test debut under him and most of my international career, so on a personal level it was quite sad that it had come to that. \n\"But once that meeting happened we had to park it. I suppose that's what we have to do now - just put that to bed and focus on Ireland this week.\"\nWales host New Zealand among four 2025 autumn Tests\nSmith eyes future Test role after Wales link\nWho could replace Gatland as next Wales head coach?\nWainwright is an expert at shrugging off disappointment.\nDuring this 14-Test losing run, he was still named Welsh player of the year, picked up his 50th cap and has remained fiercely loyal to Dragons by signing a new contract.\nAnd he has, of course, experienced the other side of the coin having been part of the 2019 Grand Slam and 2021 Six Nations title successes.\n\"There's no hiding from the fact this is a pretty low point,\" said the 27-year-old.\n\"There isn't a lot of positivity around at the moment. You can switch off to some stuff online but you can't get away from everything.\n\"After some of the things we have seen on social media or read in the press, it just makes you want to go out and prove them wrong. That's definitely a driver for me this weekend.\"\nWainwright still enjoys a report with Welsh rugby fans\nWales interim head coach Matt Sherratt wants his beleaguered squad to play with a smile on their face. \nThat may be easier said than done but Wainwright remains a player in love with the game, even with all its flaws in Wales across regional and Test level, and even when approached by fans in supermarkets.\n\"I always get a lot of fans coming up and asking about what is going on at the Dragons or Wales but I actually love those interactions because people are so passionate,\" he said.\n\"They want what's best for the national side or the Dragons and understand this is a low point, but they're are excited about the chance for us to get back to where we were.\n\"I highlight 2019 as my best year in a Welsh shirt when we won the Six Nations and then reached the World Cup semi-finals. We want to get back there.\"\nWainwright may find himself at the foot of the Six Nations and United Rugby Championship but his commitment is resolute. \nHis try against Italy was his fifth this season, already his best return in senior rugby after just 11 games, and offered a glimmer of hope in the Roman rain.\nIt also came just a week after the studs of Antoine Dupont left him with an awful facial injury in Paris.\nIreland are now lining up to put the boot into Wales next, but Wainwright has made a career of picking himself back up. Wales hope to do so as well.\n\"Matt has made a big point about changing the mindset and players enjoying being in the Wales set up,\" he said.\n\"A massive thing is about sticking together as a player group because we're the only ones that can change things over the next couple of weeks.\n\"It's a massive challenge against Ireland, one of the best teams in the world. They're incredibly detailed in whatever they do and all the little things that they can get away with.\n\"So we have to be right on our game and enjoying the challenge. I'm sure the fans will get a sense of that.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWales captain Jac Morgan takes our quiz at Six Nations launch",

I'm not allowed to announce it... but I'm just saying that the world of Peaky will continue.\"\nThe writer and producer was appearing on the show to promote his new Disney+ period drama, A Thousand Blows, starring Stephen Graham.\nThere have been six series of the Bafta-winning hit BBC TV show Peaky Blinders, from 2013-2022, with the upcoming Netflix film continuing the story of Tommy Shelby and his Birmingham crime gang.\nIt will see Oscar-winner Cillian Murphy reprise his lead role alongside an ensemble cast including Graham, Sophie Rundle, Ned Dennehy, Packy Lee and Ian Peck; as well as Rebecca Ferguson, Tim Roth, Jay Lycurgo, and Barry Keoghan.\n\"I think we've got the best British actors all in one place, including Stephen,\" noted Knight.\n\"The stuff that I'm watching, the rushes... no-one will be disappointed.\n\"It is quite an incredible thing.\"\nSpeaking on the breakfast sofa, Knight also described himself as a \"BBC loyalist\", despite the fact his new period drama A Thousand Blows is launching on Disney+.\nIn his latest creation, Graham stars as notorious boxer Sugar Goodson making his way in the dangerous world of illegal boxing in 1880s Victorian London.\nIt follows the tale of two friends from Jamaica, Hezekiah Moscow (Small Axe star Malachi Kirby) and Alec Munroe (Francis Lovehall), who find themselves thrust into the capital's bare-knuckle boxing scene.\nIt's here that Hezekiah meets Mary Carr (The Crown star Erin Doherty), queen of an all-female criminal gang known as the Forty Elephants,  who hopes to use his talents to her and her gang's advantage. \nAsked by BBC Radio 4's Today presenter Nick Robinson if this type of show could still be made by the BBC, Knight replied: \"Peaky is a BBC show and there was no issue with making that at the BBC.

That is why this claim is completely artificial against my clients.\"\nHe asked the court to strike out the claim against the band members as individuals and for it to proceed against the company only.\nIn written submissions for FSA, Andrew Burns KC, said The 1975 - who were due to be paid 350,000 dollars (\u00a3274,000) for a one-hour performance - \"deliberately behaved in a way to challenge and provoke the Malaysian authorities\".\nThe band first played the festival in 2016, agreeing at the time not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, he noted.\nBut they \"planned provocative conduct\" in 2023, which included a bottle of wine being \"smuggled\" on stage, a \"second-rate set of songs\" to \"punish and upset the Malaysian audience and authorities\" and an \"obscene speech\"; as well as the kiss which courted much publicity online, the submissions claimed.\n\"This is also a case where they could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" he said in the document.\n\"It is therefore fair, just and reasonable for the duty of care to be imposed and for them to answer for their acts of procuring breaches of contract.\"\nThe court heard that Malaysian authorities had initially refused to let the band perform amid reports about Healy's recent recovery from drug addiction.\nBut they agreed to allow the performance to take place after the band promised Healy would adhere to all guidelines and regulations, Mr Burns added.\n\"The band should be held liable as the loss was caused by their intentional misbehaviour breaching the express assurances that were given which gave rise to their personal duties of care and their responsibility for their own personal behaviour.\"\nThe court hearing is expected to conclude on Wednesday.\nIn footage shared online, Healy could be seen telling the crowd that the band's decision to appear in Malaysia had been a \"mistake\".\n\"When we were booking shows, I wasn't looking into it,\" Healy said. \"I do not see the point of inviting the 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with.\n\"Unfortunately you don't get a set of loads of uplifting songs because I'm [expletive] furious,\" the frontman continued. \"And that's not fair on you, because you're not representative of your government. Because you're young people, and I'm sure a lot of you are gay and progressive and cool.\"\nHealy and MacDonald then kissed as the band played the song I Like America & America Likes Me.\nSoon after - just 30 minutes into the set - Healy and the band walked off stage, with the singer telling the audience: \"Alright, we just got banned from Kuala Lumpur, see you later.\"\nAfter their Malaysian festival appearance was cut short, the band cancelled further concerts in Indonesia and Taiwan.\nHealy's protest stunt sparked backlash from some LGBT activists and allies in the country, with many calling it an act of \"performative activism\" that would make their lives even harder. Some said it displayed a \"white saviour complex\".\nIn a statement after the show, a source close to the band said Healy had wanted to stand up for the LGBT community.\nSeveral months later, Healy defended the move in a 10-minute speech delivered at a 1975 concert in Dallas, Texas.\nHealy said the kiss was \"not a stunt simply meant to provoke the government\" but an \"ongoing part of the 1975 stage show which had been performed many times prior\".\nHe described online anger over the performance as \"liberal outrage\", and said criticism of the band for \"remaining consistent\" by performing its \"pro-LGBT stage show\" was puzzling.",

        "article_text": "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.\nBut, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.\nThis is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".\n\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.\nAfter a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.\nHer audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. \nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.\nShe rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \n\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.\nIt affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.\nOther audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.\nFive NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.\nAPD is more common in neurodiverse people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.\nHer team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"\nNoise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.\nLisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \n\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.\n\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.\n\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.\nFor those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.\nA UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.\nAnd, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.\nProf Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"\nParticularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown. \nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.\nDr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \n\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"\nDr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. \nHe said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.\nSo-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.\nMicrophones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.\n\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.\n\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"\nTo improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\nWayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.\nHowever, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky. \n\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"\nSophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future. \n\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

The word I am thinking about is 'invigorated'. I feel so full of life, because everything is new. Just focused on what's ahead. I am so excited to be part of the team.\"\nF1 75 launch event in pictures\nRussell has 'no intention' of speaking to Verstappen\nDriving test week 'hell' for F1 rookie Antonelli\nHost Jack Whitehall, meanwhile, joked about what it must have felt like for Mercedes to see their former champion walking out for their rivals.\nHamilton became the most successful driver in F1 history racing for the Silver Arrows. Now, he is turning out for the biggest, most celebrated, most historic name in the sport, in a partnership that has created a huge buzz already, with the season still just under a month away.\n\"It's everyone's worst nightmare,\" Whitehall said. \"Your partner of 10 years running off with an Italian stallion.\"\nHamilton, team-mate Charles Leclerc and Ferrari team boss Frederic Vasseur flew back to Italy straight after the show, to prepare for the official launch of Ferrari's 2025 car in Maranello on Wednesday. As with the other teams, the car on stage was a show car in this year's paint job, not the machine that will contest this championship.\nBut Hamilton, who has gone to Ferrari with the aim of securing a record-breaking eighth title, was far from the only driver feeling the love of the audience.\nThe most popular names were no surprise - Leclerc, Hamilton's fellow Briton Lando Norris, his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, Aston Martin's veteran legend Fernando Alonso, Carlos Sainz, now at Williams, and Mercedes' George Russell all raised the roof.\nLeclerc faced the biggest ribbing from comedian Whitehall, who took every opportunity to make a joke about the Monaco native's good looks.\nAnd there was a dash of irreverence. Norris even used a naughty word as a jokey insult during a good-natured exchange with Whitehall. One trusts FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, whose crusade against bad language is regarded as ill-conceived and poorly handled by most in F1, will decide not to pursue it on this occasion.\nCertainly celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, who has a commercial deal with the sport, will think so. \"If it comes out, it comes out,\" Ramsay said as he was interviewed in the VIP area about the topic. \"Let them be real.\"\nBen Sulayem would certainly be wise not to sour the good taste left by an event that appears to have been a resounding success.\nThis video can not be played\nAntonelli was 'really nervous' ahead of driving test\nIn among the well-choreographed but also genuine celebrations of a new season, though, there was one 'gulp' moment, when Christian Horner was booed loudly as he came out on stage to host during his Red Bull team's presentation.\nAnyone wondering whether that was directed at Horner personally or the team found out the answer shortly afterwards when the cheers for four-time champion Max Verstappen drowned out a few boos.\nF1 had pulled out all the stops for this event, the first of its kind. It was nominally held to mark the 75th anniversary of the World Championship, but one imagines F1 owners Liberty Media may well be pushing for a repeat after this.\nThe attendance of all 10 teams and 20 drivers was required, and while some were more willing participants than others - Verstappen, in particular, was known not to be a fan - all were on their best behaviour, during the seven hours of media build-up to the event at a next-door hotel, and during the show itself.\nRock musician Machine Gun Kelly opened the show, and Take That closed it; there were other acts during it.\nWhitehall was a warm and witty host, poking fun at the \"beef\" between George Russell and Verstappen - \"how can anyone have a beef with George?\" he said. \"He's the nicest guy in the world.\"\nThis video can not be played\nRussell: 'Me and Max won't be best mates'\nEverything went off with an almost military precision, each team using their seven-minute allocation during the evening for their own unique style of presentation.\nMany in F1 had questioned what the show was for, but on the evidence of the night, that was obvious.\nA normal pre-season is marked by a drip-feed of individual launches by the teams. Some garner more attention than others, but none attract the sort of worldwide attention this event seems to have drawn - the audience on F1's YouTube channel peaked at 1.1m concurrent viewers, and totalled 4.6m across the live broadcast.\n\"This is a new milestone, such an amazing event,\" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said.\nThe presentations were done in reverse order of last year's constructors' championship, so the last team to do their presentation were McLaren.\n\"It's a pleasure to be here tonight,\" Norris said. \"We're all excited. A lot of hard work and today it starts.\"\nThe last word spoken by a competitor on the evening went to his ultimate boss, McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown. He judged it perfectly.\n\"We never stop racing,\" Brown said. \"Let's go.\"\nOscar Piastri (left) and Lando Norris brought McLaren their first constructors' championship since 1998 last season\nDrivers forced to make at least two stops in Monaco",

        "article_text": "Pathfinder 1, bankrolled by a Google billionaire, is an attempt to revive the airship. A century after terrifying disasters, is a safe-enough bet?\nOn 24 October 2024, a brief post was shared on the social media network LinkedIn. In it Google co-founder Sergey Brin's airship company LTA Research finally announced Pathfinder 1's first if brief untethered flight at Nasa's Moffett Field in California, part of the space agency's Ames Research Center. \"This morning, Pathfinder 1 reached another milestone: untethered outdoor flight. This successful test marks another important step in our journey, and we are excited to build on this achievement through our rigorous testing program.\"\nAirships are hard to hide. Despite the secrecy, one YouTuber filmed it from the road and uploaded it to the video-sharing site.\u00a0\n\"Pathfinder 1 is a pretty amazing vehicle,\" says Alan Shrimpton, editor of the Airship Journal. \"It is the first fully rigid airship, certainly of that size, for a very long time, and there was a great expectation that it would fly shortly after it began its outdoor testing programme.\n\"But Alan Weston [founder and former CEO of LTA Research] always said the biggest fault with rigid airships was that people in the past rushed their development and they were not going to make that same mistake. They were going to check it and check it again \u2013 and they did.\"\nThe understated tone in LTA's post belies the historic achievements of Brin's company so far. This was the first flight of the first airship built by the Google cofounder's company, the first time a classic rigid airship of this size had flown since the 1930s, and the first of a new generation of airships. The last giant rigid airship Graf Zeppelin II flew for the final time on 20 August 1939, 12 days before World War Two started, and was scrapped the following year. Rigid airships have a complex metal framework that supports a huge envelope filled with enough hydrogen or helium to lift a sizeable number of passengers, or cargo such as disaster relief, for days at a time.\u00a0\nHydrogen-filled airships are also symbols of the Golden Age of the airship. The era between the world wars when the promoters of the technology beguiled the public with promises of scheduled commercial passenger services between destinations like Europe and North America, and North America and the Pacific, and in some cases delivered on these promises. The Graf Zeppelin flew \"the first regularly scheduled, nonstop, intercontinental airline service in the history of the world\" between Germany and South America, and was far faster than ocean liners that plied the route.\nBut the crash of the airship Hindenburg in 1937 \u2013 which killed 36 people including one person on the ground \u2013 showed the drawbacks of the flammable gas used as buoyancy. The airship faded into obscurity; just as conventional aircraft design surged ahead.\nEighty-six years later in\u00a0November 2023, Pathfinder 1 emerged for the first time from the historic Hangar Two at Moffett Field to begin its outdoor flight-testing programme. But the largest aircraft in the world stayed stubbornly tethered to the ground to the frustration of many aviation enthusiasts. Its expected first flight just didn't happen.\nBut thanks to the Google co-founder's deep pockets, LTA Research appears to\u00a0 have the freedom to wait-to-get-it-right that others have not always had.\nThey have used this freedom to, for example, find better materials than lightweight aluminum alloys like duralumin to construct the giant frame of a rigid airship from, and cotton-composite materials and even cow guts to make the envelope out of, and gain a much better understanding of aerodynamics involved in flying very large airships. And it seems like they have \u00a0been able to cautiously flight test their creation, without the over confidence and pressure from investors that have been a problem in the past.\n\"People said that they could not do it and that it was impossible,\" says Janne Hietala, CEO of Kelluu Airships, whose 10 autonomous drones, each of which can be transported in a 12m (40ft) sea container, are currently \"the world's largest\" fleet of airships. \"This is a brilliant, very bold attempt to do the hard work, the engineering that is required, to mass-manufacture big airships. I don't think they will build hundreds of those because of the difficulties in mass-manufacturing airships of that size, but it's still possible.\"\nPathfinder 1 is not a historical replica. It is a proof-of-concept airship designed to see if a rigid design can be updated with new materials.\u00a0\nIn particular, LTA Research wants to solve the thorny problem of how to mass produce aircraft of this size. It wants to build production models in Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Iowa where the great US rigid airships of the 1930s were built.\n\"I've been down to Moffett Field to see Pathfinder 1 twice, and it is really an amazing thing to see in person,\" says John Geoghegan, author of When Giants Ruled the Sky. \"It's very impressive to be able to see the learning they have made from the past even from the outside.\"\u00a0\nThe fact that the giant rigid airship does not have tail fins in the traditional cross shape, but at an angle, is an example of such learning, because airships float up and down on a mooring mast and the bottom tail fin used to get damaged. Likewise, the airship's engines are no longer inline but staggered along its length to reduce the wind, drag and vibration that they used to cause. Like many other new designs, it uses helium as a lifting gas to prevent the infernos that doomed the Golden Age of the airship.\nHelium is less flammable than hydrogen, but there is a trade-off for this increased safety. It generates less lift than hydrogen, and it is in short supply. This makes it very expensive to fill the envelope of an airship with.\n\"There's a lot of baggage around airships, and a lot of people who have pre-set ideas about them, and so these guys are being incredibly careful and extremely cautious about the information they release,\" Geoghegan adds. \"They do not want to do anything to contribute any more negative publicity. For the public always remember the airship disasters and not the successful flights.\"\nPathfinder 1's first untethered flight also has significance for the wider lighter-than-air community, which has for a long time had little more than glossy CGI graphics of large airships to show investors. That it has occurred at a time when high-profile airship companies such as Flying Whales \"appear to be struggling to\u2026 build a flagship production facility\" is a good morale boost for the sector, says Shrimpton.\n\"Investors tell so many people going out to try to get funding for their lighter-than-air projects that yes, it's interesting, I can see the benefits of it, but show me one that is flying today\u2026 now they can.\"\n\"It is fantastic that LTA Research is making so much progress using modern technology to solve these problems,\" says Diana Little, co-founder of airship startup Anum\u00e1 Aerospace. \"It reminds people about the capabilities of lighter-than-air flight.\n\"Aviation is an industry desperately looking for a decarbonisation solution and airships are part of that solution,\" Little adds.\nThe first flight of Pathfinder 1 has been at least 12 years in the making. Brin's interest in airships seems to have begun in 2012 around the same time as a modern semi-rigid Zeppelin NT (New Technology) airship began tourist flights from Moffett Field.\nThe following year he founded LTA Research Ltd and in 2017 his airship company began to lease space at Moffett Field and research began at the Akron Airdock. There they built a 12-engine, 50ft-long (15m) electric \"baby airship\" to test their technology.\nNo one had built aircraft like these giant rigid airships for decades. So, it took time for the engineers to learn how to do this, particularly with a focus on safety and not repeating the mistakes of the past. In the 1930s, the materials used to create the such rigid airship's framework and envelope which were simply not strong enough to deal with the stresses of flight.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe use of computerised controls, new and much stronger lightweight materials like carbon fibre and titanium to construct the complex skeleton of the rigid airship are just some of the ways the giant rigid airship has been brought into the 21st Century. So too are the use of flame-retardant synthetic materials for the envelope of the airship, sensors to monitor the helium and engines that can be rotated to provide vectored thrust.\nThe knowledge and skills of the great engineers of the past had to be relearned by LTA \u2013 together with the latest research and technology \u2013 in order to design the airship and work out how to mass produce even larger craft in the future. Rather than expect their engineers to work at the top of unsteady 85ft-high (26m) ladders to build these ships like they did in the 1930s, LTA have designed a massive cradle-like structure that allows the workers to stay on the ground while the giant ships are slowly rotated in front of them. To do this they needed to find the skilled workers who were willing to join a risky project that may one day make aviation history, and are continuing to seek them today.\nIn 2017 work started at Moffett Field on LTA's smallest airship Pathfinder 1, and planning began in Akron on the Pathfinder 3, its successor which is planned to be one-third-larger. (There is no Pathfinder 2.)\nBut a fully-fledged return of large airships is not yet a given. \"I am crossing my fingers,\" says Shrimpton, \"but if Pathfinder 1 suffered a failure in flight everybody would point to it and say, 'See once again, a large airship crashes \u2013 it is not safe,' which would provide an almost insurmountable hurdle for the whole passenger/cargo-carrying airship industry.\"\nThe same applies to other airship companies, such as Flying Whales, whose airship has not even been built yet. \"They need to get over that same hurdle and prove to the public that they have a vehicle that is safe, like LTA Research is doing.\"\nGeoghegan is more sanguine about it. \"Interest in airships is cyclical,\" he says. \"Every 10 or 15 years a company comes along that is working in the airship category and a couple more sprout up. Some get prototypes flying. But none of them ever pan out.\n\"So, there is a lot of skittishness among the investor community about building these things. It is in part about the technology, is it robust enough to work. Then, second, what is the business application? Is there a market that exists that would financially support airships on this scale?\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The giant hangar poised for an aviation revolution\n\u2022 The huge shed built for an Arctic airship\n\u2022 How airships could return to our crowded skies\n\"We keep hearing the same things trotted out. One is for tourism. One is for disaster relief. One is that it will be a green, non-polluting alternative to conventional aircraft, and the fourth one is specialised cargo.\n\"But I remain to be convinced that there's an economic case for these things.\"\nThe engineering challenges that LTA faces certainly remain significant.\n\"In the end, for LTA Research it is proof that their design worked, and a milestone for their staff, who worked tirelessly for three or four years to bring the design to fruition,\" says Shrimpton. But Pathfinder could have much wider implications if it successfully takes to the skies. \"It is really important. It is something the whole airship industry needs \u2013 to be seen in the sky.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nMark Flekken (Brentford): Brentford have been iffy but he was a huge part of why they were able to walk away with a 1-0 victory against West Ham. It was close to being Ederson because of a goalkeeper getting an assist, but I think Flekken was the better goalkeeper on the day.\nJan Paul van Hecke (Brighton): I watched the Brighton game in person when they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup last Saturday, and it was the same level of performance when they played the same opposition on Friday. When you look at Brighton, they are a pass, pass, pass team. He's the one who looks up and is a bit brave. He's not afraid to give the ball away.\nGabriel (Arsenal) and John Stones (Manchester City): Both needed to have big performances for their teams in terms of keeping on with what they're trying to do. Arsenal are trying to win the league and Man City are trying to close the gap and stop this awful run, but with Stones back in the last couple of games they have looked miles better. Gabriel is now getting marked ridiculously closely from set pieces but is still able to get away and cause trouble, but defensively he was very good as well.\nMikel Merino (Arsenal): Merino shouldn't really get in my team of the week, but to come on and have the impact he had on that game at Leicester was absolutely massive. So I'm kind of breaking my own rule and giving a sub a place in my team.\nRyan Christie (Bournemouth): Southampton are poor but he was excellent against them - the energy and ability for the cross for the assist, and then the goal was a lovely touch and he whipped it into the far corner.\nKaoru Mitoma (Brighton): He is in it for one of the best touches I think I've ever seen. That is it, I don't care if there are other wingers that fans want to put in, that touch alone gets you in team of the week. It was an unbelievable touch and then to have the calmness to finish was excellent.\nYankuba Minteh (Brighton): He got two goals, was excellent, and was a thorn in the side of Chelsea all day. Newcastle obviously didn't want to get rid of him and you can see why. His potential with his pace and power is frightening.\nOmar Marmoush (Manchester City): I have said since he joined Man City he would be a good player, and we're starting to see now that he's going to be an exceptional player for Man City. He has what Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva have in terms of their link-up play. He is so quick and can glide past people. He can also finish. Three goals in 14 minutes gets you in team of the week.\nChris Wood (Nottingham Forest): Big Chris Wood just continues to score. He scores goals when he has no right to score.\nBeto (Everton): He had half a good season at Udinese, which is obviously why Everton bought him, but he struggled to get involved under Sean Dyche. Since David Moyes has been in, he has been excellent. He has been a whole different player. Another goal, fitter, stronger, braver.\nAnge Postecoglou (Tottenham): It was a huge game for him against Manchester United, and they had to win it.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

        "article_text": "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.\nBut, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.\nThis is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".\n\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.\nAfter a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.\nHer audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. \nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.\nShe rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \n\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.\nIt affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.\nOther audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.\nFive NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.\nAPD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.\nHer team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"\nNoise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.\nLisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \n\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.\n\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.\n\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.\nFor those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.\nA UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.\nAnd, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.\nProf Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"\nParticularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown. \nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.\nDr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \n\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"\nDr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. \nHe said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.\nSo-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.\nMicrophones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.\n\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.\n\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"\nTo improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\nWayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.\nHowever, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky. \n\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"\nSophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future. \n\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim was appointed Manchester United manager in November \nWhen Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag in October, they were 14th in the Premier League table and seven points from both the top four and the bottom three. \nFast forward three and a half months and the club are 15th, 15 points from the top four and 12 points above the relegation zone after suffering a 1-0 defeat by Tottenham - the eighth league defeat under new manager Ruben Amorim.\nThere has been no 'new manager bounce' with Portuguese coach Amorim saying he has \"a lot of problems\" and his job is \"so hard\".\nIt is no secret that United are enduring a historically poor Premier League campaign but just how large are the problems facing Amorim? \nAmorim may have jumped the gun when he described this side as \"the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United\" in January. \nAfter all, the club were relegated from the first division in 1974.\nBut in the Premier League era, they are the worst statistically at this stage of a season. \nUnited's tally of 29 points from 25 matches is their lowest at this stage of a Premier League season\nUnited have lost 12 times in 25 matches, a loss rate of 48%. \nThe club are averaging 1.16 points-per-game, which, if continued, would give them an end-of-season points tally of 44 points from 38 matches. That would be their lowest Premier League points tally. \nUnited have won four, drawn two and lost eight of Amorim's 14 Premier League matches. \nOnly Tottenham, Wolves, Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton have earned fewer points than United's 14 in their 14 Premier League matches under Amorim. \nAmorim has managed 21 matches since joining United. He has won nine, drawn three and lost nine of those matches, giving him a win rate of 43%.\nThat is the lowest of any permanent Manchester United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 over their first 21 matches in charge, with Louis van Gaal (48%) the next lowest. \nJose Mourinho (52%), David Moyes (57%), Erik ten Hag (67%) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (71%) all had significantly better records in all competitions from their first 21 matches in charge. \nThis video can not be played\nAmorim 'not worried' about mounting pressure following Spurs defeat\nOf all of United's problems under Amorim, their inability to score enough goals is the most glaring. \nA deeper look at the numbers does not make for happy reading. \nUnited have scored 28 goals in 25 Premier League matches this season - a rate of 1.12 goals-per-game.\nOnly four teams in the division - Ipswich, Southampton, Leicester and Everton - have scored fewer.\nAmad Diallo, who has been ruled out of the remainder of the season with an ankle injury, is the side's top scorer in the Premier League (six) and all competitions (nine), while centre forwards Rasmus Hojlund (two) and Joshua Zirzkee (three) have managed just five goals in 45 Premier League appearances between them.\nIn 14 matches under Ten Hag this season, United's Expected-Goals-per-game (xG) was 1.7. This has fallen slightly under Amorim, with United's xG 1.6-per-game since he took charge.\nUnited's 'big chances' created record is identical under Ten Hag and Amorim this season, with the side creating 2.9 big chances each match.\nDespite United's struggles, captain Bruno Fernandes is fourth highest for chances created in the league (53). Cole Palmer (66) is top.\nUnited finished last season with a goal difference of -1, the first time they had ended a Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference. However, they are on course to eclipse that with a -7 goal difference this term. \nSimilarly, while the 57 goals they scored during the 2023-24 campaign was their joint-lowest in the Premier League, they are on course to score fewer this season. If they maintain their rate of 1.12 goals per game, they would finish with 44 scored.\nDuring the early weeks of Amorim's reign, the former Sporting boss bemoaned the lack of time he had been to spend with his players on the training ground.\nHowever with a less packed schedule with qualification for the Europa League knockout stages assured and a Carabao Cup exit at Tottenham's hands, Amorim has been able to spend more time on the training ground.\nBut a \"free week\" before Sunday's trip to Tottenham proved anything but productive.\nBetween the 2-1 win against Leicester City in the FA Cup on 7 February and Sunday's loss to Spurs, United lost six players.\nDiallo, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Toby Collyer were ruled out of the trip through injury, while Leny Yoro and Christian Eriksen fell ill.\nTheir absences added to the long-term casualties of Luke Shaw, Mason Mount, Lisandro Martinez and Jonny Evans. \nIt meant Amorim was forced to name an inexperienced bench against Spurs with Victor Lindelof joined by Elyh Harrison, Harry Amass, Tyler Fredricson, Jack Fletcher, Jack Moorhouse, Chido Obi, Ayden Heaven and Sekou Kone. \nSweden defender Lindelof was the only one of those to have previously played for the first team. \n\nManchester United made two signings in the January window, bringing in Patrick Dorgu from Italian club Lecce and defender Ayden Heaven from Arsenal but the squad was thinner by the end of the window than when it started as Marcus Rashford, Antony and Tyrell Malacia departed on loan.\nDorgu, a multi-functional left-footed Denmark international, should provide balance at wing-back to Amorim's 3-4-3 system.\nBut the decision to allow both Antony and Rashford to leave without signing a replacement looked risky at the time and is proving so now. \nTheir departures left Hojlund, Zirzkee, Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho as the side's only recognised forwards. That list is down to three now, given Diallo's season-ending injury.\nGarnacho has no Premier League goals or assists since Amorim joined.\nRashford has made two eye-catching substitute appearances for Aston Villa since moving to Birmingham, and he played a hand in Ollie Watkins' equaliser against Ipswich on Saturday.\nAs for Antony, the Brazilian has scored three times in four matches for Real Betis since moving to Spain. This matches the tally he managed during 38 appearances for United last season and means he has scored more so far in February than United have.\n'My job is so hard' - Amorim frustrated as Man Utd lose again\nChido Obi: The 'special' Man Utd academy striker makes debut\nMan Utd under 'pressure' & must sell to buy in summer - Amorim",

        "article_text": "A couple in north-east Pakistan has been detained on suspicion of murdering a 13-year-old girl who worked for them as a maid, for allegedly stealing chocolates.\nThe girl who goes only by one name, Iqra, succumbed to multiple injuries in  hospital last Wednesday. A preliminary police investigation said she had been tortured.\nThe case in Rawalpindi has sparked widespread outrage and posts with the hashtag #JusticeforIqra having garnered tens of thousands of views, and reignited a debate over child labour and the mistreatment of domestic workers.\nLaws pertaining to child labour can vary across the country, but children under the age of 15 cannot be employed as domestic workers in the province of Punjab.\n\"I felt completely shattered inside when she died,\" Iqra's father, Sana Ullah, told the BBC.\nHe said that he had received a call from the police about Iqra last Wednesday. When he rushed to the hospital, he saw Iqra lying on a bed, unconscious. She died minutes later.\nIqra began working as a maid from the age of eight. Her father, a 45-year-old farmer, said he had sent her to work because he was in debt.\nAfter working for a few employers, she went to work for the couple two years ago, who have eight children of their own. She was earning about \u00a323 ($28) per month.\nPolice said Iqra had been accused of stealing chocolates from her employers, adding that a preliminary investigation showed that Iqra had been tortured.\nPolice also say there was evidence of frequent abuse. Pictures and videos obtained by the BBC showed multiple fractures in her legs and arms, as well as a serious injury to her head.\nAn autopsy is being conducted to assess the full extent of her injuries, and the police has told the BBC that they were still awaiting the final medical report.\n\"My heart cries tears of blood. How many... are subjected to violence in their homes every day for a trivial job of a few thousand?\" activist Shehr Bano wrote on X. \"How long will the poor continue to lower their daughters into graves in this way?\"\nOthers have pointed out that her murder was allegedly triggered by something so minor.\n\"She died over chocolate?\" asked one Pakistani user on X.\n\"This is not just a crime, it's a reflection of [a] system that enables [the] rich to treat [the] poor as disposable,\" another said. \nIqra's employers, Rashid Shafiq and his wife Sana, have been arrested, along with a Quran teacher, who worked for the family. The teacher had brought Iqra to the hospital and left after telling hospital staff that the girl's father had died and her mother was not around. \nPolice told the BBC it was unclear if she believed this to be the truth.\nIqra's father says he wants to see \"those responsible for my daughter's death punished\". \nDespite the public outrage such cases usually garner, they are typically settled out of court and it's rare for suspects to be successfully prosecuted. \nIn 2018, a judge and his wife were sentenced to three years in jail for torturing their then 10-year-old maid in what had been a highly publicised case that sparked outrage across the country. But they later had their sentences reduced to one year.\nTayyaba was found with severe injuries, which the Pakistan Institute of Medical Science said included burns to her hands and feet. Pictures of the girl also showed cuts and bruising to her face, along with a swollen left eye. She told prosecutors she was beaten for losing a broom.\nUnder Pakistani law, victims or their families have the right to forgive suspects in a number of serious crimes. To do so, they have to state in court that they forgive a suspect \"in the name of God\".\nIn reality, legal observers say that the primary motive for that \"forgiveness\" is normally financial, and paying victims is not illegal.\nAbout 3.3 million children in Pakistan are engaged in child labour, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). Moreover, women and young girls make up the vast majority of Pakistan's 8.5 million domestic workers, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).",

That bout will have big implications on what is next for the heavyweight division.\nThe winner, and the loser, will have no shortage of options.\nElsewhere, Dillian Whyte fights Joe Joyce on 5 April. That fight night also includes the professional debut of Delicious Orie and an intriguing contest between Lawrence Okolie and Richard Riakporhe. The seasoned cruiserweights face off in what is unlikely to reveal much about their capabilities at heavyweight, but is set to be a fascinating bout considering the beef between the two rivals.\nMoses Itauma, who only turned 20 in December, is expected to be added to that event, but one fight that isn't happening is Deontay Wilder's imminent return. After many whispers, Wilder's team has cooled talk of a comeback for now.\nFrazer Clarke returns to action on 20 April against Ebenezer Tetteh.\nThis is the big question that continues to be asked. Fury caught everyone off guard when he announced his retirement last month, but there seem to be very few among the boxing fraternity that believe him.\nFabio Wardley, who intends to take the WBA route to a world title shot this year, says it is virtually \"impossible\" to predict what 36-year-old Fury will ultimately decide.\n\"Fury will probably wake up tomorrow morning and think about giving it another go and then go to bed having changed his mind,\" he said.\n\"I'm not entirely convinced that he's done but if he's finished, he has given us a great career and a fantastic record of fights to look back on.\"\nDubois v Parker - all you need to know\nBeterbiev v Bivol 2: Fight week begins\nJoshua, like many of his rivals, is biding his time.

There's more to prove to other people rather than more to achieve, maybe.\n\"He has done everything you can think of but in our own brains, us boxers are not always the most methodical.\n\"A lot of us make decisions on heart and instinct, and in his soul he may feel there is more to his career and legacy.\"\nAs for Usyk, the 38-year-old has said he expects to fight just twice more before retiring. \nIt appears to rule out a mooted return to cruiserweight to face the big-hitting Jai Opetaia, but don't expect any quick decisions from the Ukrainian.\nThe next big fight will likely be decided by the outcome of Dubois' title defence.\nA win for Dubois could lead towards a fight with Usyk, and another opportunity for a Briton to become the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 1999.\nA victory for Parker would derail those plans and open the door to a huge rematch, either against Dubois or Joshua.\nIt seems unlikely Usyk will be able to hold on to all three of his belts and a scattering of the titles would open the doors to a host of fights and potential new champions.\nElsewhere there are plenty of fights to make. Derek Chisora's final fight, Wardley and Itauma's next move and a perhaps rematch between Johnny Fisher and Dave Allen.\nClarke remains a dangerous prospect while the outcome of Whyte v Joyce could have a big impact on the division.\n\"The future in heavyweight boxing across the world is bright, but especially in the UK,\" Wardley said.\n\"We have Daniel, myself and Moses [Itauma] - it looks like we will have a strong grip on the division for the next coming years.\n\"It can be one of those golden eras where we all muck in, fight and get stuck in.\"\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

        "article_text": "US black nationalist leader Malcolm X was assassinated on 21 February 1965, at the age of 39. The BBC reported on the reaction in his adopted home of Harlem, New York, as thousands of people queued to pay their last respects.\nAt a time when black civil rights leaders were preaching peaceful integration, Malcolm X's uncompromising vision of black separatism inspired many people, while terrifying others. He was murdered in February 1965, and a reporter for the BBC's Panorama, Michael Charlton, stated at his funeral that he \"spoke a vengeful message, as forthright and chilled as the winter morning they buried him\". Amid tight security, the many thousands of people who had filed past his body were searched by police as a precaution against bombings. \"To these people, he preached that if the white man didn't answer for the black man's frustration, he must answer for his fury,\" added Charlton.\nHe was internationally famous for his incendiary rhetoric, yet he had been developing a new, more moderate worldview. Asked what the death of Malcolm X meant to him by Panorama, one clearly upset man who was in the queue said: \"It's a blow to every black person in the United States of America.\" A young man described him as a hero, saying: \"He stood out among all black people. He showed the white man where it was at.\" This interviewee was one of several people who feared that more violence would follow. \"Whoever did it, Muslims or whoever did it, there's going to be a whole lot of hurt,\" he predicted. One young woman said: \"I don't believe it. Why would they kill another black man?\" Another woman had no doubt who was responsible: \"The white power structure in America is behind it. They quickly capitalised on it by saying that one of his own kind did it, but they put it up to be done. They know they had more to gain by getting Malcolm X out of the way than they had to let him live.\"\nMalcolm X was shot dead on stage at a New York ballroom as he prepared to deliver a speech to his Organization of Afro-American Unity. His wife and children were in the audience. Three men convicted of his murder were all members of the Nation of Islam, the political and religious body that, a year earlier, Malcolm X had left amid acrimony. One of the men was caught while attempting to flee, and confessed to the murder, but the other two convictions resulted in a long-running miscarriage of justice campaign. In 2021, a New York state judge agreed, and their convictions were quashed. Both men were later fully exonerated after New York's attorney general found prosecutors had withheld evidence that, in all likelihood, would have cleared them of blame for the murder.\nStill a controversial figure 60 years after his death, Malcolm\u00a0X remains to some the ultimate symbol of rage and resistance in the face of oppression. Born Malcolm Little in 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska, he was the son of a Baptist preacher. When\u00a0Malcolm\u00a0was six years old, his father was killed in what many believe was a deliberate racist attack by white supremacists, although nobody knows for sure if this was the case. The shock of his father being killed led his mother to have a mental breakdown, and Malcolm and his seven siblings were shipped out to foster homes. He fell into a life of crime, and in 1946 he was jailed for burglary. While in prison, he discovered a love of learning and self-improvement. There, he encountered the ideas of the Nation of Islam, a political and religious body that argued that equality for black Americans could only be achieved through black and white people living in separate states.\u00a0\nUpon his release from prison in 1952, he formally changed his name to Malcolm X. It was a firm rejection of the surname that had been given to his family by the people who, generations earlier, had enslaved them. He toured the US, spreading the Nation of Islam's message, and discovered that he had the power and charisma to inspire people with his words. Public speaking was a skill he had learnt, having entered prison as a middle-school dropout who, he admitted, \"didn't know a verb from a house\". He was not afraid to use shock tactics to get his message across, condemning white people as the \"white devil\" for the historic oppression of black people.\u00a0When US President John F Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, he said it was \"chickens coming home to roost\".\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nWhile Malcolm X attracted many followers, he also made a lot of enemies. In March 1964 he announced that he was leaving the Nation of Islam, having become disillusioned with its leadership. That same month, he witnessed a debate in Washington DC about the Civil Rights Bill, and he finally met Martin Luther King, Jr, a civil rights leader whose belief in nonviolent protest was often seen as being in stark contrast with Malcolm X's more confrontational philosophy.\u00a0\nTo deepen his Muslim faith, he went on the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. He wrote about how he witnessed \"pilgrims of all colours from all parts of this Earth displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood like I've never seen before\". He also toured several countries in Africa, where he made the decision to form a new secular group that sought to reconnect African Americans with their heritage. Upon his return to the US, he renounced the teachings of the Nation of Islam. Around that time, Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz began receiving death threats over the phone, and their home was firebombed.\u00a0\nDespite apparent threats coming from many directions, he continued making his electrifying public appearances. In June 1964, he officially launched his Organization of Afro-American Unity, telling the gathered audience: \"We want freedom by any means necessary. We want justice by any means necessary. We want equality by any means necessary.\" The venue was the Audubon Ballroom in New York's Washington Heights neighbourhood; eight months later he was murdered on that same stage.\nAs mourners continued to file past Malcolm X's body in a Harlem funeral home, Charlton asked several prominent people about what sort of leader he might have become. Malcolm X had become a regular visitor to the United Nations headquarters in New York, according to Daniel Watts, the editor of black nationalist magazine The Liberator. Watts said that he had been highlighting discrimination against black people in the US to members of the Afro-Asian bloc. \"I think for the first time in the history of the struggle here in this country, we had a molecule of hope \u2013 hope in the sense in knowing that we had a heritage, we had roots, we had a motherland to which we could look for,\" he said.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Martin Luther King, Jr, a misunderstood icon of US history\n\u2022\u00a0The day Nelson Mandela walked out of prison a free man\n\u2022\u00a0Nina Simone on how racial injustice fuelled her songs\nJames Farmer, director of the Congress of Racial Equality, told Panorama that while Malcolm X had not been a part of the civil rights movement, his \"more extreme stance\" had boosted its position. He said: \"The public saw very clearly that unless they did what the civil rights movement demanded, they might get Malcolm X. In fact, Malcolm said just that to me once after a debate we had. He said, 'You know you ought to stop pushing us around like this.' I asked why. He said, 'Because we help you. We make a lot of noise, people look at us and scream bloody murder, and then turn to you.'\" Farmer said that Malcolm X had been successful in giving younger black people a sense of identity. \"It has been very important because a person cannot have a sense of destiny for the future unless he believes he is somebody first.\"\nFarmer also said that Malcolm X had been trying to broaden his appeal since his split with the Nation of Islam. \"I feel that his position was in a state of flux, and that he was moving closer toward an integrationist and desegregationist position. He was over at my house just six weeks before he died, and there I asked him if his views had changed on racial issues and he indicated it was true, he was giving up black racism. Now he was prepared, he told me, to accept a man on the basis of his deeds rather than his genes. This was a switch.\"\nPoet Maya Angelou was a friend of Malcolm X who had reconnected with him during his Africa trip when he visited Ghana, where she was living at the time. Speaking in 1992, she told the BBC: \"He came to Ghana and said, 'I have found blue-eyed men who I'm able to call brother, so my prior statement that all whites were devils is erroneous.' It takes an incredible amount of courage to be able to say, 'Say everybody, you remember what I said yesterday? I've found out that's wrong.' And that's what he was able to do. That was amazing.\"\nCharlton concluded his Panorama report on Malcolm X's funeral by observing that he \"died too soon after his adoption of more moderate views for us to know what wider appeal he may have attracted\". He said the \"most arresting epitaph\" he heard that week came from a black person who said, \"I don't know how many followers he had, but he had a hell of a lot of well-wishers.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\nMark Flekken (Brentford): Brentford have been iffy but he was a huge part of why they were able to walk away with a 1-0 victory against West Ham. It was close to being Ederson because of a goalkeeper getting an assist, but I think Flekken was the better goalkeeper on the day.\nJan Paul van Hecke (Brighton): I watched the Brighton game in person when they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup last Saturday, and it was the same level of performance when they played the same opposition on Friday. When you look at Brighton, they are a pass, pass, pass team. He's the one who looks up and is a bit brave. He's not afraid to give the ball away.\nGabriel (Arsenal) and John Stones (Manchester City): Both needed to have big performances for their teams in terms of keeping on with what they're trying to do. Arsenal are trying to win the league and Man City are trying to close the gap and stop this awful run, but with Stones back in the last couple of games they have looked miles better. Gabriel is now getting marked ridiculously closely from set pieces but is still able to get away and cause trouble, but defensively he was very good as well.\nMikel Merino (Arsenal): Merino shouldn't really get in my team of the week, but to come on and have the impact he had on that game at Leicester was absolutely massive. So I'm kind of breaking my own rule and giving a sub a place in my team.\nRyan Christie (Bournemouth): Southampton are poor but he was excellent against them - the energy and ability for the cross for the assist, and then the goal was a lovely touch and he whipped it into the far corner.\nKaoru Mitoma (Brighton): He is in it for one of the best touches I think I've ever seen. That is it, I don't care if there are other wingers that fans want to put in, that touch alone gets you in team of the week. It was an unbelievable touch and then to have the calmness to finish was excellent.\nYankuba Minteh (Brighton): He got two goals, was excellent, and was a thorn in the side of Chelsea all day. Newcastle obviously didn't want to get rid of him and you can see why. His potential with his pace and power is frightening.\nOmar Marmoush (Manchester City): I have said since he joined Man City he would be a good player, and we're starting to see now that he's going to be an exceptional player for Man City. He has what Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva have in terms of their link-up play. He is so quick and can glide past people. He can also finish. Three goals in 14 minutes gets you in team of the week.\nChris Wood (Nottingham Forest): Big Chris Wood just continues to score. He scores goals when he has no right to score.\nBeto (Everton): He had half a good season at Udinese, which is obviously why Everton bought him, but he struggled to get involved under Sean Dyche. Since David Moyes has been in, he has been excellent. He has been a whole different player. Another goal, fitter, stronger, braver.\nAnge Postecoglou (Tottenham): It was a huge game for him against Manchester United, and they had to win it.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

We are worried about food security in this area,\" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC.\nAnother farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard.\n\"We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,\" she told the BBC.\nAlso known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nThey are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather.\nStanding at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates.\nBut with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home.\n\"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.\nIn the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.\nThis decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.\n\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,\" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC.\nAround Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn. \nConservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara.\nDozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda.\n\"One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,\" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC.\nMr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes.\nFarmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides.\n\"I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible.\n\"It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,\" he told the BBC.\nSarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles.\nCranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment.\n\"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,\" Ms Kugonza told BBC.\nTheir exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.\nBut crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.\n\"It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,\" said Mr Muheebwa.\nThey attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it.\nScientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days.\nAny destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns.\nTheir monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck.\n\"Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,\" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said.\nThis is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes.\nAnd in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands.\nPresident Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation.\nThe ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected.\nNature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained \"very low\".\nFor Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law.\n\"We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes,\" he said.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

And I forgot to thank so many important people.\"\nMadison was overwhelmed but overjoyed with the recognition from Bafta.\n\"I think I'm a little disassociated right now,\" she says, \"I love making movies, and being an actress is my dream, and for my film to be recognised like this is incredibly special.\n\"I don't know if I'll ever fully grasp the magnitude of being in a room like that, full of my idols, incredible creatives who I admire so much.\"\nWallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl won two prizes for its producer Richard Beek and directors Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham. The trio brought their famous characters along with them to the ceremony.\nCrossingham reflected on the fact that stories about a cheese enthusiast and his loyal but long-suffering dog always seem to go down so well in the US, despite the films firmly rooted in UK culture.\n\"It is remarkable that our very Britishness is embraced in America,\" he told journalists.\nHe highlighted one particular reference in Vengeance Most Fowl: the TV presenter in the film is called Anton Deck, a reference to Geordie duo Ant & Dec.\n\"There are some jokes, like Anton Deck, which are very British. In the American screenings, there was complete silence apart from one Brit guffawing in the corner.\n\"But we're very proud of that, we stick to our guns. Apart from one or two very specific gags like that, it seems to be embraced.\n\"And even if they're laughing at us, not with us, if they're laughing, we're still happy about that.\"\nJesse Eisenberg, who won best original screenplay for A Real Pain, walked into the winners' room carrying his Bafta and asking journalists: \"Am I expected to hold this heavy thing the whole time?\"\nAfter being reassured he was allowed to put it down as he answered questions, he reflected on the fact that the screenwriting prizes he's won for A Real Pain have both been in the UK.\n\"The other award I won for this was the London Film Critics prize, so I must be living in the wrong country,\" he joked.\n\"My background is as a playwright, and when one of my plays transferred to the West End it was far more popular. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm a novelty here and in America I'm boring.\"\nEisenberg was also asked about his relationship with co-star Kieran Culkin, who won best supporting actor. But, he said, it's not as close as people might imagine.\n\"In terms of our dynamic, I'll text him today and say, 'hey you won the Bafta, I'm so proud of you'. And then three weeks later my phone will buzz and it'll be [Culkin saying]: 'Hey, I just got this, thanks'.\"\n\"That's the closeness with which you imagine we live.\"\nZoe Salda\u00f1a continued her awards season sweep of the best supporting actress category with another win at Bafta, despite the recent controversies faced by her film Emilia P\u00e9rez.\nBackstage, she reflected on her biggest number in the Spanish-language musical, El Mal, which is also up for best original song at the Oscars. \n\"Not getting in my own way was the challenge,\" she said of shooting it. \"Sometimes you can become very heady about something and you overthink it.\n\"What you have to do is trust the process... Rehearsing the dance was about reconnecting with a part of me I had missed so much but I had since let go of for more than 20 years.\n\"Reconnecting with that, dusting off all those cobwebs and jumping into the unknown was what needed to happen.\"\nAsked about the importance of performing the musical in Spanish, she replies: \"It's my first language, I was spoken to first, sung to first, in Spanish.\n\"We love we live, we fight, we work, in Spanish. And my art has [previously] only lived in a very English way. So that yearning to connect my culture with my art was meaningful to me.\"\nWarwick Davis was the recipient of this year's Bafta Fellowship, the British Academy's highest honour.\n\"It's very overwhelming, this whole thing,\" he said. \"You win the award and then you have to talk to loads of people, feeling very shiny.\" \n(Everyone was feeling sweaty backstage by this point.)\nAsked about the moment he heard he was this year's winner, Davis said: \"I was on the toilet when I found out!\n\"[Bafta] notified me by email, and I do most of my administration work on the toilet. I might call it paperwork but then you'd get the wrong idea,\" he jokes.\n\"Then I got an email from Bafta saying I'd won the fellowship, and I got all excited, and then it suddenly dawned on me, is this a fake email? Some sort of scam?\n\"So I clicked on the email address, and it really was Bafta. Then I finished up at the loo, you probably didn't need that detail, and then went and celebrated with the kids.\"\nAdrien Brody's reaction to winning best actor might have been slightly hampered by how hungry he is. \n\"I haven't eaten anything yet, so I'm not sure how I'm feeling, but I'm so happy to be here,\" he says backstage.\nBrody is asked about the surge his career has enjoyed in recent months thanks to The Brutalist, more than two decades after his last awards run for The Pianist.\n\"The beauty of being an actor is that any life experience, and there have been many since [The Pianist], anything you've experienced is so valuable in shaping a sense of understanding,\" he reflects.\n\"So the moments of triumph, loss, complexity along your path, they give you an ability to represent those more truthfully and authentically in your work.\n\"I'm just so grateful to have had this meaningful opportunity come my way, I've been yearning for this for a long time.\n\"I've been working very hard. It's not for a lack of hard work, but there are so many magical things that have to happen for a film to achieve greatness and I'm so happy that all of those things conspired on The Brutalist.\"\nAnd with that, he's off to have some supper.\nConclave won best film and best British film, becoming the first movie to take the top two prizes since 1917 (the film, not the year).\n\"I am so humbled and so grateful to be welcomed here so openly with such warmth and open arms,\" its German director Edward Berger says of the UK. \"Basically, I just want to live here, I'm never going to leave.\"\nHe likens the cast of Pope drama Conclave, which includes Stanley Tucci, Ralph Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini, to an orchestra.\n\"No-one really knows [why a cast works so well], but you have a hunch, so there's a lot of discussion - we put pictures up on the wall and it just felt like a good combination,\" he explained.\n\"They were all believable cardinals, all different nationalities and accents, it just felt they were all different instruments in a big musical piece.\"\nThe Brutalist's Brady Corbet might have won best director, but he said he was slightly too \"jet-lagged and exhausted\" to fully process it. \nAs much as he's enjoying awards season, he notes: \"It'll be amazing when it's done, I'm looking forward to getting back to work.\"\nCorbet is not shy of hard work - making the Brutalist was famously a labour of love which took several years. \"We basically just didn't sleep,\" he says. \"I haven't had a day off in years.\"\nNow that awards campaigning is in its final phase however, with voting for the Oscars closing on Monday, he should finally get some down time. \"The week leading up to the Oscars is actually pretty quiet, I'm looking forward to it.\"\nThe Brutalist, a 3.5-hour film with an intermission, has been a relative box office success despite its intimidating duration.\n\"I'm not trying to teach anyone a lesson or anything,\" he says, \"but I do think it's good for the ecosystem that a film like this which is completely uncompromised - I don't like too many cooks in my kitchen - for that to have made $30m globally so far, that's exciting.\n\"All the things you're told not to do, when those films are proven to be commercially viable, and people want original, daring movies, it makes me feel more optimistic than usual.'\"",

        "article_text": "Jannik Sinner has been world number one since June 2024\nJannik Sinner's case was \"a million miles away from doping\", a senior figure at the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has said.\nThe men's tennis world number one was handed an immediate three-month ban by Wada on Saturday after reaching a settlement over his two positive drug tests last year.\nSinner, 23, was cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for banned substance clostebol in March 2024.\nWada had been seeking a ban of up to two years after launching an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) following the initial decision by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) not to suspend Sinner.\nHowever, a deal was reached when Wada accepted Sinner was inadvertently contaminated and \"did not intend to cheat\".\nSinner has stated that he was inadvertently contaminated by his physiotherapist, who was treating a cut on his hand with an over-the-counter spray, which was later found to contain the banned substance.\nThe case has divided the tennis world, with some questioning the timing and length of the ban, how the Italian was able to agree a deal and inconsistencies between recent doping cases.\nIt led to Switzerland's three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka posting on X: \"I don't believe in a clean sport any more.\"\nNovak Djokovic, the 24-time Slam winner, questioned the fairness of the process and said there is \"favouritism\" towards high-profile players.\n\"This was a case that was a million miles away from doping,\" Wada general counsel Ross Wenzel told BBC Sport.\n\"The scientific feedback that we received was that this could not be a case of intentional doping, including micro-dosing.\"\nWenzel rejected any suggestion of special treatment and said the terms of the ban - that some have claimed will have little effect on Sinner - were appropriate for the case and not taken with the tennis calendar in mind.\nSinner's suspension began on 9 February and runs until 4 May, making him eligible to play at the French Open - the next Grand Slam - which begins on 25 May.\nHe has not featured competitively since beating Alexander Zverev in the final of the Australian Open on 26 January and could still be ranked number one when he returns to action.\nWenzel said: \"Wada has received messages from those that consider that the sanction was too high and, in some respects, if you have some saying this is unfair on the athlete, and others saying it's not enough, maybe it's an indication that although it's not going to be popular with everyone, maybe it's an indication that it was in the right place.\n\"When we look at these cases we try to look at them technically, operationally and we don't do it with fear of what the public and the politicians or anyone is going to say.\"\nThis video can not be played\nIt's time for us to address the anti-doping system  - Djokovic\nWorld number one Sinner banned for three months \nDoping ban impacts Sinner as little as possible - Broady\nMedvedev hopes Sinner doping ban deal sets precedent\nJannik Sinner won his third Grand Slam title in January by triumphing at the Australian Open for a second time\nSinner could return from the ban on home soil, with the Rome Masters set to get under way on 7 May - three days after his suspension is lifted.\nThat would allow the three-time Grand Slam champion the opportunity to get in some competitive action on clay before heading to the French Open.\nOn Monday, British player Liam Broady said he believed Sinner's ban had been timed to impact the world number one's career \"as little as possible\", while former British number one Tim Henman said it \"seems a little bit too convenient\".\nWenzel insisted that sanctions are \"blind to the calendar\" and that the ban was executed as swiftly as possible after a resolution had been agreed upon by all parties.\n\"Once you've reached an agreement, what you can't do is then say 'oh, but we're going to have this apply from two months in the future for a period of three months',\" Wenzel said.\n\"It must come into effect quickly. Of course, once the deal is done, it's important that it is executed and that it is made public for reasons of transparency.\n\"So it happened, because of the timing of the CAS proceedings, it happened to be decided last Friday, it was a very late night, and it came into effect immediately, so that is the reason for the timing.\n\"The sanctions that we impose and the code even says this, they're blind to the calendar.

        "summary": "Wada says Sinner case 'million miles away from doping'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jannik Sinner has been world number one since June 2024Laura ScottSports News Correspondent@laurascott__Bobbie JacksonBBC Sport JournalistPublished8 hours agoJannik Sinner's case was \"a million miles away from doping\", a senior figure at the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has said.The men's tennis world number one was handed an immediate three-month ban by Wada on Saturday after reaching a settlement over his two positive drug tests last year.Sinner, 23, was cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for banned substance clostebol in March 2024.Wada had been seeking a ban of up to two years after launching an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) following the initial decision by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) not to suspend Sinner.However, a deal was reached when Wada accepted Sinner was inadvertently contaminated and \"did not intend to cheat\".Sinner has stated that he was inadvertently contaminated by his physiotherapist, who was treating a cut on his hand with an over-the-counter spray, which was later found to contain the banned substance.The case has divided the tennis world, with some questioning the timing and length of the ban, how the Italian was able to agree a deal and inconsistencies between recent doping cases.It led to Switzerland's three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka posting on X: \"I don't believe in a clean sport any more. \"Wada only introduced the possibility of a case resolution agreement in 2021, allowing it to strike a deal with athletes.Since adding that provision to Wada's rules, Wenzel believes about 67 resolution agreements have come into effect. \"Wenzel rejected any suggestion of special treatment and said the terms of the ban - that some have claimed will have little effect on Sinner - were appropriate for the case and not taken with the tennis calendar in mind.Sinner's suspension began on 9 February and runs until 4 May, making him eligible to play at the French Open - the next Grand Slam - which begins on 25 May.He has not featured competitively since beating Alexander Zverev in the final of the Australian Open on 26 January and could still be ranked number one when he returns to action.Wenzel said: \"Wada has received messages from those that consider that the sanction was too high and, in some respects, if you have some saying this is unfair on the athlete, and others saying it's not enough, maybe it's an indication that although it's not going to be popular with everyone, maybe it's an indication that it was in the right place. \"This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, It's time for us to address the anti-doping system  - DjokovicWorld number one Sinner banned for three months Published3 days agoDoping ban impacts Sinner as little as possible - BroadyPublished1 day agoMedvedev hopes Sinner doping ban deal sets precedentPublished2 days agoSanctions are 'blind to the calendar'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jannik Sinner won his third Grand Slam title in January by triumphing at the Australian Open for a second timeSinner could return from the ban on home soil, with the Rome Masters set to get under way on 7 May - three days after his suspension is lifted.That would allow the three-time Grand Slam champion the opportunity to get in some competitive action on clay before heading to the French Open.On Monday, British player Liam Broady said he believed Sinner's ban had been timed to impact the world number one's career \"as little as possible\", while former British number one Tim Henman said it \"seems a little bit too convenient\".Wenzel insisted that sanctions are \"blind to the calendar\" and that the ban was executed as swiftly as possible after a resolution had been agreed upon by all parties. \"I checked this this morning and and it might be one or two out, but I counted 67 since the provision came into force in January 2021,\" Wenzel said.",

        "article_text": "Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: \"Montoya, por favor!\"\nIf you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island.\nContestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids.\nIn Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.\nForced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules. \nBlind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky. \nA second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.\n\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224 million times since 4 February. \n\"Montoya. The tension... you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"\nYet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.\n\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.\n\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask, what would I do in that situation?\"\nThe magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.\nGonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".\n\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.\nThe Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.\nSeeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.\n\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.\n\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self... or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"\nAlongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV-to-influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.\nA curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media. \nA previous British version failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.\nAfter Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\". \nWhen asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".\nLike Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.\nA heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints. \nDespite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.\n\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"\nTemptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.\nTake Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love) is another. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.\nSo is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain? \nWhen I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.\n\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality,\" he says, adding that no gender should face double standards.\nIn the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.\nWhen I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during and after filming.\nMontoya received particular support after his beach escapade. \n\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.\nLooking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch a US version of the show next month. \nGonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards!\"",

She's passionate as a person. You can see she's smiling a lot and is very happy with where she's at. \n\"I think that's important, that you have players in a good place, [who] feel good and feel motivated. That is when you get the most out of yourself.\"\nKelly was in high spirits at full-time, walking around the pitch smiling and laughing with England captain Leah Williamson.\nOn hitting the bar, she said: \"I thought it was going in.\"\nWilliamson joked: \"And the shirt would have come off!\"\nIt has not been plain sailing for Kelly since her iconic celebration - when she took off her Lionesses shirt and waved it around her head seconds after scoring the winning goal in the Euro 2022 final at Wembley Stadium.\nBut she is enjoying her football again.\n\"The challenge is always there and I am ready to fight for my shirt and I want to work hard to do so,\" added Kelly.\n\"It's all about building relationships with those players that you play together with on the field.\n\"I have settled in really well and am building those relationships already.

        "article_text": "Over its 40-year run, EastEnders hasn't just been plot twists, emotions and gripping \"doof doof\" cliffhangers.\nIt's also tackled social issues head-on, its stars say.\nThe series has \"done more to create social awareness\" on these issues \"than probably any documentary\", says actor Ross Kemp, who plays leather-jacket-wearing Grant Mitchell.\nKemp, who is hosting a BBC documentary on the history of the soap, says over the last four decades EastEnders has been able to take on subjects many feel are taboo - and it continues to do so with recent storylines including topics such as spiking.\n\"You can introduce those things through a continuing drama, a soap like EastEnders, and inform more people than you possibly would do with a government campaign,\" he says.\nOn 17 November 1987, EastEnders aired a kiss between characters Colin Russell (played by Lord Michael Cashman) and his boyfriend Barry Clark (Gary Hailes) on the side of the head.\nThere was a \"furore\" after the kiss was broadcast, Kemp recalls, adding \"it wasn't even a kiss on the lips\".\nFormer actor Lord Cashman speaks to Kemp about the reaction during the new documentary EastEnders: 40 Years on the Square.\n\"The media went berserk,\" he says. \"There were calls for 'this kind of filth to be taken off our screens'.\"\nLord Cashman says \"it was a weird and dark time,\" adding \"there was rampant homophobia\".\nIn 1988, Section 28 of the Local Government Act was introduced, which banned places like schools and libraries from \"promoting homosexuality\".\nLord Cashman's character Colin went on to share the first mouth-to-mouth kiss between two gay men on a British soap with character Guido Smith (Nicholas Donovan) in 1989.\nHowever, the former actor, later an activist and politician, recalls the reaction from fans: \"There was one guy and he said: 'I used to stand behind the sofa so that my mum and dad couldn't see me looking at you and I knew I wasn't alone.' It made a difference.\"\nAccording to Ofcom's first review of public service television broadcasting, audiences said early evening programmes, like soaps, had an important social role in airing complex and controversial issues.\nOne example came in the early 2000s, when the soap featured a domestic violence and coercive control storyline featuring Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) and her brutal partner Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns).\nActor Ainsworth says members of the public would often confuse her for her character and offer sympathy to her in the street. \"People would try and sit me down in places, they'd put their arms around me,\" she says. \"They'd want to look after me.\"\nThe actor adds she received \"hundreds\" of letters a week from victims of similar violence.\nThough one watchdog at the time said the show went \"too far\" for pre-watershed TV, research for a national domestic violence helpline highlighted the storyline as the most significant TV portrayal of violence in the home in 30 years.\nMolly Rainford, who plays Anna Knight, was introduced to the Square in 2023. She is the daughter of George Knight and Cindy Beale and is part of the first black and dual heritage family to run a pub on any UK soap.\nIn February 2024, the soap aired scenes of Molly and her on-screen sister, Gina Knight (Francesca Henry), discussing colourism and how differently they are treated because of their different skin tones.\nColourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are the same race but have lighter skin.\nSpeaking about the storyline, Rainford says: \"These are conversations that happen in every mixed-raced family's life. All of these conversations are so important and so valid, especially right now.\"\nRainford says parents told her their children had \"conversations on the playground that day after seeing that\".\nIn 2015, Riley Carter Millington became the first transgender man to play a recurring trans character in a British soap, with his portrayal of Kyle Slater in EastEnders.\nCarter Millington says \"there wasn't a lot of on-screen representation\" for trans people and he was \"overwhelmed\" and grateful to have been cast in the role.\n\"I understood the weight of it and I didn't take it lightly,\" the actor says, adding that despite leaving the soap in 2016, he still gets messages from fans about his character.\nKemp adds that EastEnders is \"ever-evolving\" with society - and that while there will \"always be a certain crowd that will poo poo it and look down upon it\", it has made some \"landmark television\" over the last 40 years.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, you can visit BBC Action Line, including for issues related to sexual abuse and violence and domestic abuse.\nAs part of EastEnders' 40th anniversary week, BBC News will be hosting live coverage of the live episode on Thursday 20 February, which you can watch on BBC One and iPlayer, and follow on our live page.\nFrom Wednesday, you'll be able to cast your vote here on who Denise decides her future is with, Jack or Ravi.",

        "article_text": "\"Our plane crashed. It's upside down.\"\nThese were the words of John Nelson, a passenger on a Delta Air Lines flight that had just crashed and flipped while landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport.\nAll 80 people on board the flight from Minneapolis - 76 passengers and four crew - have survived, the airport's chief executive has said.\nEighteen people were injured but only a small number are thought to be seriously hurt, and investigators are looking into what caused the crash.\n\"Most people appear to be okay. We're all getting off,\" Mr Nelson said in a video posted to Facebook soon after the incident.\nHe later told CNN that there was no indication of anything unusual before landing.\n\"We skidded on our side, then flipped over on our back,\" he said, adding that \"there was a big fire ball out the left side of the plane\". \nLike Mr Nelson, Ashley Zook took immediately to social media to express her disbelief, filming herself saying: \"I was just in a plane crash. Oh my God.\"\nPassengers were left suspended from the ceiling of the cabin.\n\"We were upside down hanging like bats,\" Peter Koukov, who was also on the plane, told CNN.\n\"One minute you're landing, kind of waiting to see your friends and your people, and the next minute you're physically upside down,\" another passenger, Pete Carlson, told CBC.\nMr Nelson said he was able to unbuckle himself and push himself to the ground. \"Some people were kind of hanging and needed some help... and others were able to get down on their own,\" he said.\nMr Carlson said passengers quickly acted as a team. \"What I saw was everyone on that plane suddenly became very close, in terms of how to help one another, how to console one another.\"\nVideo footage shared on social media shows people clambering out of the overturned aircraft, with fire crews spraying it with foam.\nPassengers were seen being helped out of the plane's doors by airport staff, with some then running away from the plane's entrance.\nDespite a plane flipping on the runway, Diane Perry said she learned of the crash when her family called her while she was in line to check her luggage.\n\"It was kind of ironic that we were in the airport and didn't know that there was a crash outside,\" she told the BBC.\nThe reason for the crash is not yet clear. Two runways will remain closed for several days for investigation and passengers have been told to expect some delays.\nMr Nelson is still processing what had just happened, telling CNN he was \"stressed, nervous, shaky still\". He added: \"It's amazing that we're still here.\"\nThat sentiment was echoed by Mr Carlson, who said it was \"really amazing\" to be alive, while sporting a cut on his head. \"I'm a little balder than I was this morning,\" he said.

        "article_text": "As White Lotus season three is released, executive producer Mark Kamine explains the behind-the-scenes wrangling and key challenges when choosing a filming location.\nIt's being called the \"White Lotus effect\": the way that major TV shows influence the way we travel, thanks to the hit TV show that's back on 16 February 2025.\nThe black comedy-drama, written by Mike White, is in a new location for a third season, following the guests and staff of fictional five-star resort, the White Lotus. The dark drama satirises the excesses of the rich, set against the struggles of the staff, in a glamorous setting.\u00a0\nIt's thrilling, pacey stuff with beautiful people, gripping action and a tense setup that tells you from episode one, that although this looks like paradise, something terrible is going to happen. In the first season, a coffin is unloaded from a plane; while in the second, a body is discovered floating in the sea by a guest. Season three's trailer is peppered with shots of guns and whispers of body bags amid the palm trees and luxury spa treatments.\nDespite the gory details and the lampooning of the rich, everyone wants to stay at the White Lotus. When it was announced mid 2024 that Thailand would be the location for the TV show's third season, global interest in travel to the country soared, with booking platforms reporting immediate increases in searches, and airlines including Finnair adding extra weekly flights to Phuket. Hotels.com reported a 40% spike in booking interest for the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui, one of the filming locations.\u00a0\nThe expectations come with a precedent: the Sicilian hotel, the Four Seasons San Domenico Palace in Taormina, Sicily, where season two was filmed, reported it was booked out for six months when it reopened after filming and continues to attract guests wanting a slice of the White Lotus lifestyle. The original White Lotus, the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, Hawaii, said it saw a 425% uptick year on year in website visits and 386% increase in availability checks.\nThe White Lotus isn't the first drama to have an outsized effect on the travel industry \u2013 the impact of films like Lord of the Rings and The Sound of Music on tourism has been well documented, as has the much-criticised Emily in Paris. But what's interesting right now, in the digital age, is how quickly news about a streamed TV show setting can have an impact.\n\"Back in 2015, research showed that around one in five people coming to Britain were coming because of something they'd seen on TV,\" said screen tourism specialist Seren Welch. \"Fast forward to now, and the latest Visit Britain research shows that nine in 10 visitors to the UK are influenced by what they have seen in film and TV. It's unheard of.\"\u00a0\nThis rise is down to the prevalence of streaming platforms: as Welch notes, 10 years ago, we didn't have Disney+ and Netflix was a lesser phenomenon. Today, streaming algorithms are powerful drivers of our behaviour far beyond the screen, with the opportunity to binge-watch everything anywhere leading viewers to be ever more immersed.\n\"I've heard a British Airways exec say that when they see a spike in traffic to a destination, they look at what's peaking on Netflix to explain it,\" Welch said.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to planning a location for a TV show like The White Lotus, Mark Kamine knows a thing or two. Kamine, one of The White Lotus's executive producers, started his career as a location scout working on all six seasons of The Sopranos, along with film credits on Hollywood films including Ted, American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook.\nHis new book On Locations: Lessons Learned From my Life on Set with the Sopranos and in the Film Industry details the behind-the-scenes wrangling inherent in location work, from negotiating with strip club owners keen to do under-the-table deals, to pacifying home owners who have just found out you've staged a mafia killing in their house. It's a lively read, running through the behind-the-scenes production level details about how to make one destination stand in for another on the tightest of tight budgets.\nWhile many of Kamine's previous film and TV productions have had financial issues constraining filming locations, when it came to The White Lotus, the wild success of the first seasons meant that when deciding the location for season three, there was plenty of choice.\u00a0\n\"Mike White had the idea for something around Eastern philosophy,\" Kamine explained. \"We were looking for what was practical and eye-catching, and to start with, Korea, Philippines, Japan, Bali and Sri Lanka were in the mix, as well as Thailand.\"\u00a0\nFurther discussion and research narrowed the choice to Japan and Thailand, with White and Kamine and others making research trips to see what would work best. (White typically stays in the resort to write and research the show ahead of production.)\nKamine notes in his book that the key challenges faced by location scouts centre on budgets: productions often end up being shot in dupe locations, where, for example, Prague might stand in for New Jersey, because even when subsidised, US locations can't compete with European, Asian or African crew and material costs. But for a sure-fire hit like The White Lotus, which had a reported $38.5m budget for season two and drew in 4.1 million US viewers for its finale, Karmine and his team chose the option that reflected the story they wanted to tell best, rather than make a financial compromise.\n\"Mike said that he feels like we've cracked the code,\" Kamine admitted, \"in that we've figured out how to stay in these luxury locations and create great TV. What a life.\"\nThe new series is filmed in the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui, with the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok, Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Villas and Anantara Bophut Koh Samui Resort also featured \u2013 along with a little creative licence.\u00a0\n\"Anyone who has been to the Four Seasons in Sicily that we used in the show will know that the beach isn't where it seems to be,\" said Kamine. \"Some scenes in season three are shot at one hotel, and some aspects are filmed elsewhere. The common spaces need to have real impact, that's a driver here. Overall, the main thing is that it looks beautiful.\"\u00a0\nThe White Lotus team are aware of the impact the filming has on future bookings and the local tourism scene. Kamine says he keeps in touch with the hotel managers from the previous series and is aware of the debate around overtourism, noting that these popular five-star locations already have existing tourism infrastructure and have been developed to handle a certain number of visitors.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0White Lotus 3 Thailand filming locations revealed\n\u2022\u00a0The White Lotus season three review\n\u2022\u00a0'Set-jetting': How on-screen locations are becoming travel destinations\nHowever, given that films shot in Thailand have driven a surge of tourism in the past \u2013\u00a0the extreme popularity of The Beach caused Maya Bay to close, for instance \u2013\u00a0it's somewhat surprising to find that Thailand has no plan in place to mitigate a potential tourism surge from the show. A spokesperson from Tourism Thailand noted that the country is still trying to build back its tourism industry following Covid, and that since the show airs in Thailand's shoulder season, it is most likely to boost tourism numbers in these quieter months when there is more capacity than in peak season.\nThe White Lotus isn't the only streaming show boosting holiday bookings. As set-jetting continues to be a popular motif in the travel industry, new series including Yellowstone prequel 1923, set in Montana, are expected to drive more tourism. It's not without its problems: in 2023, The Washington Post reported that Yellowstone has driven tourism to the region but has brought with it misconceptions: it does rain, it can be cold, and not everyone is as well dressed as the show would have you believe. That's showbusiness.\nSeason two of Wednesday, also releasing this year, is a good case in point: the show is set in a fictional town in Vermont but season one was shot in Romania and season two filmed in Ireland. The final season of Stranger Things will air later this year as well, set in the town of Hawkins, Indiana but filmed in Jackson, Georgia. It's a known filming location \u2013 The Walking Dead and The Vampire Diaries were also shot there \u2013 and the local tourism authority already has information on how to follow the shows around town. Tellingly, it notes that \"the upside down is NOT included\".\nAs for The White Lotus, now that season three is out, thoughts are turning to season four. Kamine wouldn't confirm or deny any location currently under discussion for the next series but did let slip that one thing is important: going back perhaps to his Soprano days, it needs to be somewhere where it's easy to dump a body.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

Some held signs that read \"Say no to Doge\" and \"Deport Musk\".\nThe protest in Berkeley - a top California city for electric car ownership - numbered 200.\nAs part of his White House-backed effort called Doge, for Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has been sending teams into government agencies to comb through data and pushing for massive spending cuts as well as \"clawbacks\" of money already spent. \nPresident Donald Trump, who received an historic amount of campaign donations from Musk, is on the same page, freezing hiring as well as laying off thousands of federal employees.\nMusk says he has uncovered wasteful spending and his work is aimed at making the government operate more smoothly. But to many, he is stopping the government from functioning while making decisions that should be left to elected leaders and accessing private information.\n\"It's just really grinding on the mind,\"  said Dale Koistinen. \"I'm 84 years old. This is unbelievable. This is a takeover of our government.\"\nAlong with X, Musk also is the primary owner SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. But it is Tesla he is most known for and Tesla is where people unhappy with his Doge work are taking out their anger.\nFor days, concerned Americans have been asking fellow citizens to dump their Tesla stock and sell their Tesla vehicles.\nSinger-songwriter Sheryl Crow posted a video to Instagram that showed her Tesla being towed away.\n\"There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with,\" she wrote in the caption. \"So long Tesla.\"\nCrow added that she was donating proceeds from the car's sale to National Public Radio in the U.S., a frequent target of Musk's ire.\nTesla stock surged following Donald Trump's election in November. Musk contributed a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election effort, and hit the trail on Trump's behalf in the final days of the campaign.\nBut after touching an all-time high in December, the company's shares have shed 30% of their value with a pronounced selloff since Trump was inaugurated last month.\nSaturday's protests were promoted by prominent disinformation researcher Joan Donovan and the actor Alex Winter, who played Bill in the 80s movie \"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.\" \nTeah Jackson, though, noticed the Berkeley protest during an outing with her girlfriend, and stopped to show her support.\n\"It's hopeful,\" Jackson told the BBC. \"It's an acknowledgement that people aren't going to go down without a fight and that they're going to continue to push for what they believe in.\"",

America is still in Nato but Europe can no longer automatically rely on the US to come to its aid.\nIn Brussels, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Nato's European members to spend much more on defence, saying they would have to provide the \"overwhelming\" share of military funding for Ukraine.\nThe US and Russia are going to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine, whether Europe and Ukraine like it or not. \nThe talks in Saudi Arabia will end a three-year freeze in talking to Vladimir Putin, despite urgent warnings by Kyiv that the Russian leader is not to be trusted.\nThey follow a phone call between Donald Trump and Putin on Wednesday.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be joined by national security adviser Mike Waltz and the US special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, US officials said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has repeatedly said he would not accept any deal struck without his country's input, said Kyiv had not been invited to the talks.\nEurope, everyone agrees, needs to rapidly raise its defence spending if it has any hope of deterring a newly emboldened Russia. \nThe current Nato-mandated minimum of 2% of GDP is likely to rise to 3%. Russia currently spends more than twice that on defence in percentage terms.\nIn January, Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national income on defence. Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte has also urged member states to boost their defence spending.\nBut Europe as a whole has already overtaken the US in terms of aid to Ukraine. In total, it has allocated \u20ac70bn ($73bn; \u00a358bn) in financial and humanitarian aid as well as \u20ac62bn in military aid. This compares to \u20ac64bn in military aid from the US as well as \u20ac50bn in financial and humanitarian allocations.\nUS Vice President JD Vance's blistering attack on Europe's policies on Friday was called \"ill-judged\" and \"insulting\" by many of the delegates at the Munich Security Conference. \nThey had hoped he would reassure them the US was not abandoning Ukraine. \nInstead, he spent the majority accusing European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech.\nThe address was met by silence in the hall, and later denounced by several politicians at the conference. \nBut the speech appealed to others on both sides of the Atlantic and Donald Trump  called it \"brilliant\".\nWhile the Munich conference was occupied by the geopolitical, Donald Trump announced plans to bring in a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports from March.\nIt was evidence there are now very obvious rifts between Washington's positions and Europe's on several issues, from trade to dealing with Russia. \nIt is a divide that the UK is struggling to bridge, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer telling reporters both relationships were important and Britain was \"not choosing between the US and the EU\". \nBut the Trump team's own messaging is sometimes contradictory, rowing back on grand pronouncements the day after they have been made.",

That's why I do this job.\"\nShe pointed out that while exciting experiments are happening in micro-gravity environments on Earth, these can only last for a brief period. \n\"Removing that gravity element is completely irreplaceable,\" she said.\nDr Coogan added that as space is used more for various purposes, it's crucial to protect both the space environment and the Earth's environment. \n\"What we do in space really is for the benefit of Earth,\" she added.\nRegarding satellites, she mentioned that while they play a role in Earth research, scientists must also consider the issue of space debris. \n\"When we send these new technologies into space it is very much a push now to have an end-of-life plan for the satellite,\" she said.\n\"How is it going to be de-orbited or send into a higher orbit where it is out of harms way?\"\nOn Wednesday, Dr Coogan will be speaking to the NI Space Office about her journey as part of the Northern Ireland Science Festival.\n\"There is a real pull to say yes to these events, particularly when you are engaging with young people,\" she said.\n\"School children wrote in and recorded their questions, it is fascinating for me to see what young people are interested in and try my best to give them answers.\n\"Every now and then there will be a question you'll have never imagined before.\"",

        "article_text": "UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time.\nUK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.\nThe MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.\nAsked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.\nThe Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.\nThe rejection of their applications was controversial because they came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.\nThe inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.\nBBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.\nThe MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials.\nThe confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.\nDocuments disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.\nMike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".\n\"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,\" Martin said.\n\"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,\" he added.\nJohnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard \"horrific\" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.\nMercer said it was \"very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry\".\nThe MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.\nThe government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.\nMany are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.\n\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.\nThe officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.\n\"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,\" he said.\nThe MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.\nThe legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.\n\"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,\" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.\n\"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at.\"\nLawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.\nIn court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.\nNew evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.\nThe MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".\nBut officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.\n\"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,\" said former officer who served with UKSF.\n\"We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,\" he said.\nThe Ministry of Defence has previously told the BBC: \"There has been no evidence to suggest that any part of the MoD has sought to prevent former members of the Afghan specialist units from giving evidence to the inquiry.\"",

The rest had died shortly after the stranding.\nTasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.\nFalse killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes. \nAuthorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.\nLocal resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.\n\"There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'.\"\n\"It's just absolutely horrific.\"\nThe site - about 300km from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.\n\"This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,\" he said.\n\"We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.\"\nRough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.\n\"The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,\" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.\nWith conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the \"tough\" and \"confronting\" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.\n\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,\" Dr Carlyon said.\nThat grim task - which involves shooting the animals -  is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.\nAuthorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested \"it may be a case of... letting nature run its course\".\nAuthorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.\nMore than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.\nAround 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.\nWhales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.\nThere are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disoriented after following fish they hunt to the shore.\nOthers believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.",

        "article_text": "Ruben Amorim was appointed Manchester United manager in November \nWhen Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag in October, they were 14th in the Premier League table and seven points from both the top four and the bottom three. \nFast forward three and a half months and the club are 15th, 15 points from the top four and 12 points above the relegation zone after suffering a 1-0 defeat by Tottenham - the eighth league defeat under new manager Ruben Amorim.\nThere has been no 'new manager bounce' with Portuguese coach Amorim saying he has \"a lot of problems\" and his job is \"so hard\".\nIt is no secret that United are enduring a historically poor Premier League campaign but just how large are the problems facing Amorim? \nAmorim may have jumped the gun when he described this side as \"the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United\" in January. \nAfter all, the club were relegated from the first division in 1974.\nBut in the Premier League era, they are the worst statistically at this stage of a season. \nUnited's tally of 29 points from 25 matches is their lowest at this stage of a Premier League season\nUnited have lost 12 times in 25 matches, a loss rate of 48%. \nThe club are averaging 1.16 points-per-game, which, if continued, would give them an end-of-season points tally of 44 points from 38 matches. That would be their lowest Premier League points tally. \nUnited have won four, drawn two and lost eight of Amorim's 14 Premier League matches. \nOnly Tottenham, Wolves, Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton have earned fewer points than United's 14 in their 14 Premier League matches under Amorim. \nAmorim has managed 21 matches since joining United. He has won nine, drawn three and lost nine of those matches, giving him a win rate of 43%.\nThat is the lowest of any permanent Manchester United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 over their first 21 matches in charge, with Louis van Gaal (48%) the next lowest. \nJose Mourinho (52%), David Moyes (57%), Erik ten Hag (67%) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (71%) all had significantly better records in all competitions from their first 21 matches in charge. \nThis video can not be played\nAmorim 'not worried' about mounting pressure following Spurs defeat\nOf all of United's problems under Amorim, their inability to score enough goals is the most glaring. \nA deeper look at the numbers does not make for happy reading. \nUnited have scored 28 goals in 25 Premier League matches this season - a rate of 1.12 goals-per-game.\nOnly four teams in the division - Ipswich, Southampton, Leicester and Everton - have scored fewer.\nAmad Diallo, who has been ruled out of the remainder of the season with an ankle injury, is the side's top scorer in the Premier League (six) and all competitions (nine), while centre forwards Rasmus Hojlund (two) and Joshua Zirzkee (three) have managed just five goals in 45 Premier League appearances between them.\nIn 14 matches under Ten Hag this season, United's Expected-Goals-per-game (xG) was 1.7. This has fallen slightly under Amorim, with United's xG 1.6-per-game since he took charge.\nUnited's 'big chances' created record is identical under Ten Hag and Amorim this season, with the side creating 2.9 big chances each match.\nDespite United's struggles, captain Bruno Fernandes is fourth highest for chances created in the league (53). Cole Palmer (66) is top.\nUnited finished last season with a goal difference of -1, the first time they had ended a Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference. However, they are on course to eclipse that with a -7 goal difference this term. \nSimilarly, while the 57 goals they scored during the 2023-24 campaign was their joint-lowest in the Premier League, they are on course to score fewer this season. If they maintain their rate of 1.12 goals per game, they would finish with 44 scored.\nDuring the early weeks of Amorim's reign, the former Sporting boss bemoaned the lack of time he had been to spend with his players on the training ground.\nHowever with a less packed schedule with qualification for the Europa League knockout stages assured and a Carabao Cup exit at Tottenham's hands, Amorim has been able to spend more time on the training ground.\nBut a \"free week\" before Sunday's trip to Tottenham proved anything but productive.\nBetween the 2-1 win against Leicester City in the FA Cup on 7 February and Sunday's loss to Spurs, United lost six players.\nDiallo, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Toby Collyer were ruled out of the trip through injury, while Leny Yoro and Christian Eriksen fell ill.\nTheir absences added to the long-term casualties of Luke Shaw, Mason Mount, Lisandro Martinez and Jonny Evans. \nIt meant Amorim was forced to name an inexperienced bench against Spurs with Victor Lindelof joined by Elyh Harrison, Harry Amass, Tyler Fredricson, Jack Fletcher, Jack Moorhouse, Chido Obi, Ayden Heaven and Sekou Kone. \nSweden defender Lindelof was the only one of those to have previously played for the first team. \n\nManchester United made two signings in the January window, bringing in Patrick Dorgu from Italian club Lecce and defender Ayden Heaven from Arsenal but the squad was thinner by the end of the window than when it started as Marcus Rashford, Antony and Tyrell Malacia departed on loan.\nDorgu, a multi-functional left-footed Denmark international, should provide balance at wing-back to Amorim's 3-4-3 system.\nBut the decision to allow both Antony and Rashford to leave without signing a replacement looked risky at the time and is proving so now. \nTheir departures left Hojlund, Zirzkee, Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho as the side's only recognised forwards. That list is down to three now, given Diallo's season-ending injury.\nGarnacho has no Premier League goals or assists since Amorim joined.\nRashford has made two eye-catching substitute appearances for Aston Villa since moving to Birmingham, and he played a hand in Ollie Watkins' equaliser against Ipswich on Saturday.\nAs for Antony, the Brazilian has scored three times in four matches for Real Betis since moving to Spain. This matches the tally he managed during 38 appearances for United last season and means he has scored more so far in February than United have.\n'My job is so hard' - Amorim frustrated as Man Utd lose again\nChido Obi: The 'special' Man Utd academy striker makes debut\nMan Utd under 'pressure' & must sell to buy in summer - Amorim",

        "article_text": "Robert Pattinson stars as multiple clones in the South Korean film-maker's big-budget follow up to Parasite \u2013 and while the star himself is entertaining, the film as a whole is a mess.\nNo best picture winner at the Oscars has been as exciting in recent years as Bong Joon Ho's Parasite \u2013 and not just because it was the first ever victor not in the English language. A scabrous takedown of the complacency of the rich, it was subversive in the way few awards players truly are, while its celebration within the gilded denizens of Hollywood added an extra layer of irony. \nFor fans of the South Korean film-maker, the good news is that despite his added commercial stock, his long-awaited follow-up is no less mischievous: a large-scale sci-fi filled with Hollywood stars and big themes it may be, but it mostly eschews the grandiose self-importance typical of such an endeavour. The bad news \u2013 and possibly an explanation for its delays in release \u2013 is that it doesn't really know what approach it wants to take instead.\u00a0All in all, it must be considered a serious disappointment from the director.\nAt least Robert Pattinson fans will be happy to get multiple (well, mostly two) versions of the actor for the price of one. He plays Mickey Barnes, a down-on-his-luck guy in a dystopian near-future, where floods of citizens are desperate to leave Earth, who signs up to a space colony program as an \"expendable\" \u2013 that is, a guinea pig worker who can be deployed in various perilous experiments for the benefit of humanity, only to be \"reprinted\" every time he inevitably dies, as a new cloned version of himself. Which is all well and good, until version number 17 of him unexpectedly survives after falling down an ice shaft on the planet Niflheim \u2013 and finds Mickey number 18 already installed in his living quarters. The question is: how do two versions of the same person learn to get along \u2013 or not?\nThe \"reprinting\" or human cloning premise is certainly one that should have plenty of narrative potential. It could be a rich source of philosophical inquiry, given what it raises about the nature of the self, death, and more besides. It could also, of course, be the basis for some decent satire, casting as it does its \"expendables\" scheme as the logical endpoint for a society that desires to exploit people without consequences. Yet on the former front, the film seems peculiarly uninterested in dealing with the questions it throws up, while in the latter respect, the comedy is so broad as to be completely toothless.\nMore like this:\n \u202210 of the best films to watch this February \n \u2022 Six ways the Berlin Film Festival will make waves\n \u2022 Why 'category fraud' is causing Oscars anger\nThe colony is run by Mark Ruffalo as a veneer-toothed, bouffant-haired, callous showman \u2013 and it's a groaningly obvious performance, from start to finish; just as tiresome is Toni Collette as his equally despotic wife, flashing a Cheshire Cat-sized grin of insincerity throughout. The brilliance of Parasite lay in how it took apart the superficial \"niceness\" of its privileged characters: here, however, they are so obviously and uninterestingly awful \u2013 characterisations worthy of a bad Saturday Night Live skit \u2013 that the effect is to defang the story of any genuine bite.

But then that, too, becomes sidelined as the pair put their animosity aside and join forces for an epic action climax, involving them meeting the planet's native cockroach race the Creepers \u2013 think Dune's gapingly-mouthed Sandworms with legs. Suddenly, Bong does indeed go for a conventional blockbuster earnestness he has hitherto rejected \u2013 and fails to make that fit too;\u00a0like its hero, this is a film with a major identity crisis. \nWith a reported budget of $150m, it would certainly be a surprise if this curio can find the kind of audience it needs to succeed. In these risk-averse times, it's good to see an expensive studio film that is at least deeply idiosyncratic \u2013 but you have to hope such a folly doesn't make the money men even more cautious in future. \n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday. \nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

All in all, it must be considered a serious disappointment from the director.At least Robert Pattinson fans will be happy to get multiple (well, mostly two) versions of the actor for the price of one. That might be forgivable if the film was at least funny \u2013 but again and again lines and scenes strain for comic effect, but fail to deliver the goods.Mickey 17Director: Bong Joon HoCast: Robert Pattinson, Naomi Ackie, Mark Ruffalo, Toni ColletteRun-time: 2hr 17mSome of the actors fare better with the material: as Mickey's lover Nasha, Naomi Ackie is enjoyably sweary and makes the most of a rousing anti-authoritarian speech, while Pattinson has fun with the antagonism between Mickey 17, a nebbish type with a touch of Steve Buscemi, and the surly, more rebellious Mickey 18. For fans of the South Korean film-maker, the good news is that despite his added commercial stock, his long-awaited follow-up is no less mischievous: a large-scale sci-fi filled with Hollywood stars and big themes it may be, but it mostly eschews the grandiose self-importance typical of such an endeavour. Which is all well and good, until version number 17 of him unexpectedly survives after falling down an ice shaft on the planet Niflheim \u2013 and finds Mickey number 18 already installed in his living quarters.",

US officials said that Ukraine had also been invited - though President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country has received no such invitation.\nConservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel told Victoria Derbyshire it was \"too premature to make assumptions\" about the way the peace talks were heading.\n\"We all have to have very, very cold and calm heads right now, primarily because this conflict is still raging.\"\nShe said Ukrainians should be the ones to determine their future because the war was about their \"independence and sovereignty\". \nAsked if she supported President Trump's proposal that Ukraine give up territory to end the conflict, she said: \"We have to understand in more detail what they are saying, it's too easy to generalise.\n\"It's very early days in those talks, and I think right now, the United Kingdom, along with Nato allies, we must continue to be firm and solid and strong in that support we're giving.\" \nDame Priti added that as a priority, the UK needed to step up its spending on defence.  \nAppearing on the same programme, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said it was \"no surprise\" Trump and his team were taking \"a completely different\" approach by putting \"everything up for grabs\" in terms of Ukraine.\nHe described it as a \"massive wake-up call\" for European leaders to take responsibility for their own defence.  \nGreen Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said Ukraine had to be \"at the front and centre\" of any peace talks.  \nHe warned that the Trump administration's moves could leave Ukraine and the rest of Europe \"at risk of future Russian aggression\". \nKarin von Hippel, former director at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), said she did not think Trump would \"sell Ukraine down the river\" and European nations should \"stay calm\".\nMeanwhile, Conservative former Prime Minister Sir John Major has warned that democracy was under threat as the US steps back from its role as a world leader.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that Trump's policy of \"isolation\" was creating a power vacuum which would embolden countries like Russia and China to fill it.\nSir John said: \"Many of the gains we made over recent years, when the Soviet Union collapsed, are now being reversed and you see a very aggressive Russia again in Ukraine.\n\"And if they were to succeed with their venture in Ukraine, no doubt they'd be elsewhere before too long.\"",

        "article_text": "\"When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste',\" says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. \"It makes me so proud,\" she says.\nRakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired.\n\"Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me,\" she says.\nWhen Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete.\n\"I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'\" she recalls.\nHer teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to.\nFor a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her.\nA middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury.\nThere was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners.\nHowever, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. \"I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country,\" he says.\nHe invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities.\nWhen they are running \"it's the small things that matter\", says Rahul. \"When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort.\"\nCompetition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete.\nOver time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now \"I believe in my guide runner more than myself\", says Rakshitha.\nThey won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags.\nRakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024.\nThey missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze.\nSimran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone.\nBut in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running.\nBut the search proved challenging. \"It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do,\" she explains.\nSimran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events.\n\"They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy',\" he says. \"But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult.\" Every movement has to be synchronised.\nSimran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met.\nTheir first race, the 100m, ended in disaster.\n\"Neither of us knew the rules properly,\" says Simran. Abhay \"thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely\". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her.\nBut by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category.\nRiding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal.\nBut Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too.\nAlthough guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path.\n\"All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities,\" says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name.\nBoth Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with.\nDespite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. \"I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal,\" she says, hoping that next time she will win gold.\nRakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. \"She must win a medal,\" he says. \"There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them.\"\nThe BBC Indian Sportswoman Of The Year (ISWOTY) Award is back with its fifth edition to celebrate and honour the remarkable achievements of women athletes in India. Find out about the nominees - the winner will be announced on 17 February.",

        "article_text": "It has been more than a decade since James Howells' hard drive - containing Bitcoin now worth hundreds of millions of pounds - ended up on a landfill site. \nBut despite facing numerous setbacks, he is determined to continue on his mission to retrieve it.\n\"This is my job, if you will. My 9 to 5,\" he said, adding he would \"absolutely not\" give up.\nThe value of the cryptocurrency has dramatically increased in recent months, and with the hard drive currently worth about \u00a3620m, Mr Howells said \"it makes sense for me to focus my energy on this\" - although he does do some other work with crypto currencies. \nMr Howells, from Newport, claimed his ex-partner mistakenly threw out the hard drive, containing 8,000 bitcoins, in 2013, with it ending up in a tip owned by Newport City Council. \nLast month, a High Court judge threw out his efforts to access the landfill or get \u00a3495m in compensation, saying there were no \"reasonable grounds\" for bringing the claim and \"no realistic prospect\" of succeeding at a full trial.\nHe is now planning a case \u2013 representing himself using artificial intelligence to support his claim \u2013 at the Court of Appeal. He has also expressed interested in buying the site after the council said it planned to close it in the 2025-26 financial year. \nNewport council said it was making no further comment on the matter.\nMr Howells was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies, mining the Bitcoin in 2009 when it was a small fraction of its current value.\nHe has said that his former partner accidentally dumped the hard drive \u2013 about the size of a mobile phone \u2013 containing a Bitcoin wallet in 2013. As its value soared, he organised a team of experts to attempt to locate and recover it.\nHe repeatedly asked permission from the council for access to the site, offering it a share of the missing Bitcoin if it was successfully recovered.\nAfter Mr Howells launched legal proceedings, the council applied for a High Court hearing to ask a judge to dismiss the claim before going to trial \u2013 which the judge did last month.\nThe council argued its environmental permits would forbid any attempt to excavate the site for the search and previously said such work \"would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area\".\nUnwilling to give up, Mr Howells now believes he has two options open to him to retrieve the digital wallet \u2013 launch a case at the Court of Appeal, or work with investors to try to buy the landfill site from the council, after it announced the site is \"coming to the end of its life\" and it plans to close it within the next two years.\nMr Howells told BBC News he was pleased with the work his legal team had done in the High Court trial, but that he would now be representing himself in a case filed with the Court of Appeal \u2013 using an \"artificial intelligence agent\" to assist his claim.\nHe described AI as \"an absolutely amazing technology\" that had helped him better understand court processes and the law, and that he believed he had about seven \"solid grounds in law\" for his case, which he hopes to be able to present in-person to the Court of Appeal.\nOne of the arguments in his case will centre on the council's plans to close the site, something he argued should have been revealed during the High Court trial.\n\"That is material information that should have been made [at the trial] \u2013 the judge should have been aware of that, as well as myself,\" he said.\nMr Howells also said buying and fully excavating the site would save the council what he argued were significant maintenance costs once the site closes.\n\"Every single piece would be extracted or recycled, and at the end of the process we would have a hard drive in our hands - and we would also have an empty landfill,\" he said.\nIn the High Court trial, the council also argued that the hard drive became its property as soon as it entered the landfill site, but Mr Howells said this failed to take into account the fact it was his ex-partner who threw it out.\n\"It was taken without my permission or consent,\" he said.\nMr Howells said he was also exploring the option of buying the site from the council, adding he had \"preliminary agreements\" with investors \u2013 including those in the Middle East and the United States \u2013 who could make funding available if he had permission to buy the site.\n\"They're not just going to put millions of quid in my back pocket... but if the council show a willingness to sell the site, then the funding will be available,\" he said.\nThe council has made no indication it is interested in selling the site and, as part of its closure, has secured planning permission for a solar farm on part of the land.\nHaving spent many years pursuing it, including opening legal cases, Mr Howells said he was certain the hard drive remained on the landfill, which holds more than 1.4 million tonnes of waste.\nHe said he had done his \"due diligence and research\", having spoken to a site manager at the landfill.\n\"Anything that was put into that site is still there. So, where else could it be?\"\nAsked if he would ever give up his mission to retrieve it, he said: \"Absolutely not. This is like the final battle in Braveheart.\"\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual or digital currency that has no physical form.\nBitcoins can be split into smaller units, with a satoshi being the smallest monetary unit. \nSatoshis are named after Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 believed to be a pseudonym \u2013 who wrote a key document about the currency in 2008.\nThose investing in the product around this time, like Mr Howells, were part of a \"very small\" crypto community known as Cypherpunks, said Billy Bambrough, author of the CryptoCodex newsletter.\nBitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency to be invented, but it did gain considerable attention with early adherents being \"very quickly enamoured with it\", Mr Bambrough said.\nPrices began to rise in about 2016 and 2017, and again in 2020 during the Covid pandemic when \"stock markets, cryptocurrencies and meme coins went up hugely\".\n\"A lot of people got very rich, but a lot of people also lost money,\" Mr Bambrough said.\nThe cryptocurrency also saw rapid increases in late 2024, shortly after Donald Trump's victory in the US general election, with his administration being seen as far friendlier towards cryptocurrencies than the Biden White House.\n\"A lot of people in the crypto and Bitcoin worlds say the price has gone up so much in such a short amount of time, they claim it could go higher and higher,\" Mr Bambrough said.\n\"So I can understand why James [Howells] is keen to find his Bitcoin.\"",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump has made the mass deportation of undocumented foreign nationals a key policy, with the US said to have identified about 18,000 Indian nationals it believes entered illegally.\nLast week Narendra Modi said India would take back its nationals who were in the US illegally, and also crack down on the \"human trafficking ecosystem\".\n\"These are children of very ordinary families, and they are lured by big dreams and promises,\" he said during his visit to Washington.\nNow a new paper by Abby Budiman and Devesh Kapur from Johns Hopkins University has shed light on the numbers, demographics, entry methods, locations and trends relating to undocumented Indians over time.\nHere are some of the more striking findings.  \nUnauthorised immigrants make up 3% of the US population and 22% of the foreign-born population.\nThe number of undocumented Indians among them is contested however, with estimates varying widely due to differing calculation methods.\nPew Research Center and Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS) estimate some 700,000 people as of 2022, making them the third-largest group after Mexico and El Salvador.\nIn contrast, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) puts the figure at 375,000, ranking India fifth among origin countries. \nThe official government data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  offers yet another picture, reporting 220,000 unauthorised Indians in 2022.\nThe vast differences in estimates highlight the uncertainty surrounding the true size of the undocumented Indian population, according to the study. \nIndian migrants make up only a small share of the overall unauthorised migrant population in the US.\nIf Pew and CMS estimates are accurate, nearly one in four Indian immigrants in the US is undocumented - an unlikely scenario given migration patterns, the study says. (Indian immigrants are one of the fastest-growing groups in the US, surging from 600,000 in 1990 to 3.2 million in 2022.)\nThe DHS estimated in 2022 that the undocumented Indian population in the US dropped 60% from its 2016 peak, falling from 560,000 to 220,000. \nHow did the number of undocumented Indians drop so steeply from 2016 to 2022? Mr Kapur says the data doesn't provide a clear answer, but plausible explanations could be that some obtained legal status while others returned, particularly due to COVID-related hardships.\nHowever, this estimate doesn't reflect a 2023 surge in Indians at US borders, meaning the actual number could now be higher.\nDespite rising border encounters, US government estimates show no clear increase in the overall undocumented Indian population from the US financial year (FY) 2020 to 2022, according to the study.\nEncounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country's borders with Mexico or Canada.\nVisa overstays by Indians have remained steady at 1.5% since 2016.  \nThe number of Indian recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) has also declined from 2,600 in 2017 to 1,600 in 2024. The Daca programme protects migrants who came to the US as children. \nTo sum up: the undocumented Indian population grew both in numbers and as a share of all unauthorised migrants, rising from 0.8% in 1990 to 3.9% in 2015 before dropping to 2% in 2022.\nThe US has two main land borders. \nThe southern border along the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas bordering Mexico sees the most migrant crossings. Then there's the US-Canada border spanning 11 states.\nBefore 2010, encounters involving Indians at the two borders were minimal, never exceeding 1,000. \nSince 2010, nearly all encounters involving Indians occurred along the US-Mexico southern border. \nIn FY 2024, encounters of Indian nationals on the northern border surged to 36% of all Indian crossings, up from just 4% the previous year.\nCanada had become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with shorter visitor visa processing times than the US.  \nAlso, there was a surge in attempted border crossings from 2021 onwards, and the encounters at the Mexico border peaked in 2023.\n\"This is not specific to Indians. It is part of a larger surge of migrants trying to come into the US after Biden was elected. It is as if there was a high tide of migrants and Indians were a part of it,\" Mr Kapur told the BBC.\nThe study finds that the states with the largest Indian immigrant populations -California (112,000), Texas (61,000), New Jersey (55,000), New York (43,000) and Illinois (31,000) - also have the highest numbers of unauthorised Indian immigrants.\nIndians make up a significant share of the total unauthorised population in Ohio (16%), Michigan (14%), New Jersey (12%) and Pennsylvania (11%). \nMeanwhile, states where more than 20% of Indian immigrants are unauthorised include Tennessee, Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin and California.\n\"We expect this because it's easier to blend in and find work in an ethnic business - like a Gujarati working for a Gujarati-American or a Punjabi/Sikh in a similar setup,\" Mr Kapur said. \nThe US immigration system allows people who are detained at the border who fear persecution in their home countries to undergo credible \"fear screenings\". Those who pass can seek asylum in court, leading to a rise in asylum applications alongside rising border apprehensions.\nAdministrative data doesn't reveal the exact demographics of Indian asylum seekers, but court records on spoken languages provide some insight.\nPunjabi-speakers from India have dominated Indian asylum claims since 2001. After Punjabi, Indian asylum seekers spoke Hindi (14%), English (8%) and Gujarati (7%).\nThey have filed 66% of asylum cases from FY 2001\u20132022, suggesting Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana as key migrant sources.\nPunjabi speakers from India also had the highest asylum approval rate (63%), followed by Hindi speakers (58%). In contrast, only a quarter of Gujarati speakers' cases were approved.\nUS data collected by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Indian asylum requests in the US have skyrocketed.\nThe requests jumped tenfold in just two years, rising from about 5,000 in 2021 to over 51,000 in 2023.\nWhile this spike is most dramatic in the US, similar trends are seen in Canada, the UK and Australia, where Indians are among the largest asylum-seeking groups, the study says.\nMr Kapur believes this is \"largely a way to game the asylum system rather than an objective fear of persecution, as processing takes years\". \nGiven the large number of Punjabi-speakers who seek asylum, it's unclear what has changed in the northern Indian state ruled by the Congress party (2017-22) and latterly the Aam Aadmi Party (2022\u2013present) to drive this surge.  \nUnder Trump's second presidency, asylum requests are set to plummet. \nWithin his first week, a key app for migrants was shut down and removed from app stores, cancelling nearly 300,000 pending appointments, including asylum cases already in progress.\nUS data shows most Indian asylum seekers are Punjabi and Gujarati - groups from India's wealthier states, better able to afford high migration costs. \nIn contrast, Indian Muslims and marginalised communities and people from conflict zones like the regions affected by Maoist violence and Kashmir, rarely seek asylum, the study says.\nSo most Indian asylum seekers are economic migrants, not from the country's poorest or conflict-hit regions.\nThe arduous journey to the US - whether via Latin America or as \"fake\" students in Canada - costs 30-100 times India's per capita income, making it accessible only to those with assets to sell or pledge, the study says.\nNot surprisingly, Punjab and Gujarat - top origin states for unauthorised Indians -  are among India's wealthier regions, where land values far exceed returns from farming.  \n\"Even illegality takes a lot of money to pursue,\" the study says. \nWhile rising asylum claims may seem linked to \"democratic backsliding\" in India, correlation isn't causation, the authors say .\nPunjab and Gujarat have long histories of emigration, with migrants heading not just to the US but also the UK, Canada and Australia. \nRemittances - India received an estimated $120bn in 2023 - fuel aspirations for a better life, driven not by poverty but \"relative deprivation\", as families seek to match the success of others abroad, the study says. \nA parallel industry of agents and brokers in India has cashed in on this demand. \nThe Indian government, says the study, \"has looked the other way, likely because the issue of illegal migration is much more a burden for receiving than sending countries\". \nBetween 2009 and 2024, around 16,000 Indians were deported, according to India's ministry of external affairs.  \nThese deportations averaged 750 per year under Obama, 1,550 under Trump's first term, and 900 under Biden.\nIndian migrant removals spiked between FY 2023 and 2024, but the peak was in 2020 with nearly 2,300 deportations.",

        "article_text": "An iconic image of Kate Moss marked an explosive moment of change in Britain \u2013 and helped to create the culture we now live in. It's among the photographs displayed in a new exhibition that celebrates the photography of The Face magazine.\nFreckled and fresh-faced, a 16-year-old Kate Moss laughs, make-up-free and unadorned except for a delicate string of beads and a headdress made of feathers \u2013 the image on the cover of The Face magazine in July 1990 was perfectly timed. It captured a moment in Britain when the nation's youth was coalescing around a burgeoning acid-house movement, with impromptu parties filling disused warehouses, aircraft hangars and fields across the country. The escapist, chaotic rave scene that spanned class and race was an explosion of optimism and euphoria amid difficult times of high unemployment and a weak economy. The magazine's cover portrait marked a new era, with Kate Moss the coming decade's feather-crowned queen.\u00a0\nThe iconic portrait by Corinne Day is among the photographs on display at London's National Portrait Gallery in the exhibition The Face Magazine: Culture Shift. Lee Swillingham, former art director of The Face \u2013 along with photographer Norbert Schoerner \u2013 came up with the idea for the show, which charts the British style magazine's photography through the years. \"For me, The Face really was the best chronicler of British youth culture,\" says Swillingham, who co-curated the exhibition with NPG's senior curator of photographs, Sabina Jaskot-Gill.\nThe Moss portrait was \"a breath of fresh air,\" Swillingham tells the BBC. \"It was a moment of moving on from the aspirational, stylised glamour of the 80s, and into a more pared-down and realistic phase in fashion terms. That whole photography style went hand in hand with a more attainable sense of beauty.\"\nIt was Swillingham's predecessor as art director Phil Bicker who initially championed the emerging photographer Corinne Day and the then unknown teenage model Kate Moss. \"I was searching for someone who would be 'the face of The Face',\" Bicker tells the BBC \u2013 not a glossy, \"aspirational\" fashion muse but a natural, real one, in tune with the magazine's readership. \"Kate had the Britishness and youthfulness that The Face represented \u2013 she was funny, and laughed a lot. She seemed to me a person first, and a model second.\" Inside the July 1990 issue of the magazine, Moss is shown on the beach at Camber Sands on the south coast of England, messing about guilelessly in a series of photos striking in their simplicity and naturalness.\nIt was \"a perfect storm,\" says Bicker. \"And despite Kate's subsequent global profile and extensive career, she's still associated with The Face, and that defining moment which launched her career. It was shot in a way by Corinne that allowed Kate\u2019s personality and positive energy to come through, so that when people saw the images, they forgot they were looking at a styled fashion story, instead believing this was a portrait of Kate unadorned.\"\nMoss nor her agency particularly liked this raw, slightly gawkish depiction of the model, according to Sheryl Garratt, then The Face editor, writing in The Observer in 2000. The shoot has nonetheless remained a cultural touchstone, embodying a moment in time. The magazine's founder Nick Logan later said: \"At that time, at the start of the rave scene, I remember saying, 'let's aim it at those people dancing in fields'.\" The 1990 images of Moss reflected not only a new aesthetic but also a deeper cultural change in the UK, with the cover line of the magazine referring to a \"summer of love\", in reference to the exploding outdoor rave scene.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Eight striking images that define America\n\u2022\u00a0The photographs that skewer British peculiarities\n\u2022\u00a0The indigenous American supermodel bringing change\u00a0\n\"It was a real moment of transition,\" Angela McRobbie, professor of cultural studies at Goldsmiths, University of London, tells the BBC. \"It marked a shift, when a subculture moved into mass visibility. Rave culture opened its doors to a much vaster section of boys and girls who would never have gone dancing in that way before. It was a new form of leisure, and a youth culture becoming mass leisure.\"\nWhereas the post-punk music-and-fashion scene had emanated more from an \"art-school\" milieu, argues McRobbie, the rave scene at its height was a much broader movement that grew organically from economic and social circumstances. \"The working-class rave scene was an escape from the mundanity of post-industrial Britain, where the skilled labour market had declined. Rave gave working-class kids a sense of freedom,\" she says.\nIt was a sense of empowerment, McRobbie continues, which was later echoed in Morvern Callar, the 2002 film by Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, which starred Samantha Morton. \"It's based on a book by Alan Warner,\" says McRobbie, \"and it's about working-class girls in Aberdeen, stacking shelves\". It charts a gradual awakening of the protagonist's sense of agency and self, and \u2013 like Day's image of Moss on the beach \u2013 emanates a mood of escape, freedom in nature, and a sense of possibility.\n\"The rave scene was a gamechanger in terms of gender,\" says McRobbie, whose book Feminism, Young Women and Cultural Studies traces the evolution of British subcultures from the 1970s. \"For boys, it was a new moment of emotional, non-aggressive sexuality, partly because of the [drug] ecstasy, and the expression of feelings of love and joy, and dancing for five to seven hours non-stop, which boys would have done before in gay or queer spaces like Heaven in London. But for your average working-class boy to enjoy that physical pleasure, openness and freedom, that was new. And for girls it was a time of getting in touch with their physical bodies, too, dancing for hours.\"\nBut despite the \"summer of love\" headline on The Face's 1990 cover, according to McRobbie, this cultural moment in the UK had nothing much in common with the original 1960s Summer of Love in the US. \"Sociologists wouldn't put those two movements together,\" she says \u2013 the hippy Summer of Love in San Francisco in 1967 was \"qualitatively different\". \"[The rave scene] was not connected to an overtly political agenda. The San Francisco Summer of Love was a time of social change that grew from Berkeley University and was pro-civil rights. It was overtly political and, with [Allen] Ginsberg involved, literary.\"\nIf there was a precursor of the British rave movement, it was the Swinging '60s, which were imbued with a mood of liberation and the breaking down of past hierarchies. \"The Swinging '60s were associated with a freeing up and a breaking down of barriers, in class, sexuality and gender,\" says McRobbie. \"It was designer Mary Quant [creator of the mini skirt], the Pill. Doors were opening, and for working-class young women it was an important time of excitement and freedom, particularly in urban centres such as London and Glasgow.\"\nThe It girl of that moment was the gamine, teenage model Twiggy \u2013 with her waifish figure, cheeky smile and working-class origins. Bicker told The Observer: \"Kate hadn't been modelling for very long but, even in her awkwardness, she had that thing about her that Twiggy had in the 60s, a freshness that matched the times.\" She was, in the way she defined her era, Moss's predecessor \u2013 along with the late Marianne Faithfull, the \"wide-eyed poster girl for the Swinging '60s\", who later in life became good friends with the model.\nIt wasn't long before the new aesthetic sparked by the summer of love shoot was influencing the commercial world, most noticeably in advertising campaigns by Calvin Klein with Moss for Obsession, and with Moss and Mark Wahlberg for the brand's underwear. In subsequent issues, The Face continued to reflect the optimistic feeling about the decade ahead \u2013 one cover story shot by Day, and \u00a0titled Young Style Rebels, featured \"five faces for the 90s\" with Moss, Rosemary Ferguson, Lorraine Pascale and other models who departed from the 80s \"glamazon\" norm. \"After the supermodels, a new generation is coming through with new ideas and attitude\" said the introduction.\nThe next time the Moss-Day pairing caught the public's attention was with a 1993 fashion story for British Vogue, in which a very thin Moss posed in underwear in a downbeat bedroom. They were again defiantly unglitzy images, but this time \u2013 perhaps because of the context of the venerable magazine in which they appeared \u2013 they provoked outrage. Grunge fashion, waif style and \"heroin chic\" became phrases used in the British tabloid newspapers.\nThe Face was soon moving on to its next phase of the 90s \u2013 a succession of new lads and ladettes, grunge and Britpop bands, and edgy young British artists (known collectively as \"the YBAs\") all adorned the covers of big-selling issues of the magazine, which from 1993 had a fresh look, courtesy of Swillingham, the new art director. \"There was a kind of shift. From reality to anti-reality, technology and retouching, a more kinetic, colourful feel,\" he says. Swillingham commissioned photographers such as Norbert Schoerner and Elaine Constantine, and the resulting aesthetic was, again, soon adopted by the commercial world, with numerous ads influenced by the colour-drenched, hyperreal style \u2013 notably a 1995 ad for Levi's.\nNew Labour was on the horizon. The Face was, says McRobbie, central to the \"post-industrial creative economy, which was welcomed by Tony Blair and New Labour\". In 1997, artists, pop bands \u2013 including Oasis \u2013 and fashion folk were invited to 10 Downing Street by then British Prime Minister Blair. In the same year, Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit adorned the front cover of prestigious US magazine Vanity Fair with the coverline \"London swings again\", and the YBAs' Sensation exhibition showed at the Royal Academy. Cool Britannia was born. \"Just as the Swinging London of the 1960s was a moment of great creativity and entrepreneurship, so was the 1990s,\" says McRobbie.\nSome have argued that the late 80s and early 90s rave movement in Britain was a moment of conscious uprising and egalitarian protest, a uniquely anarchic outpouring with its hedonistic, unruly origins in the country's chaotic and distinctive folk rituals. It is argued that it was a coming together of all genders, races and classes, and a significant movement that resonates now \u2013 and has enjoyed a recent revival. For others, it is a collective memory of joy. There's no doubt the movement drew from a broad sweep of society \u2013 its adherents gathered from far and wide, from the football terraces, the suburbs, the inner cities, student campuses, the home counties. And certainly, there were protests around the introduction by the government of a bill brought in to end illegal raves.\nHowever, according to McRobbie, rave was not a movement about ideas or politics. \"The rave scene and the waif look weren't political. The movement evolved and became about jobs and entrepreneurship, eventually becoming the creative industries in fashion, music and more. The legacy of The Face is that it kickstarted a valuable \u2013 to the economy \u2013 celebrity culture, big industries and sponsorship deals.\"\nLee Swillingham echoes this: \"Fashion got industrialised in the 2000s, brands got bigger, and were bought out by big groups. High fashion became industrialised, and The Face was part of that change. The magazine started getting more advertising, though we were still outsiders.\" This phase in pop culture of the late 2000s and 2010s\u00a0\u2013 which was dominated by a grimy, hedonistic look, and the sounds of bands like The Strokes and The Libertines\u00a0\u2013 was later revived and reincarnated in the 2020s as the Indie Sleaze\u00a0 aesthetic.\nSadly photographer Corinne Day died from a brain tumour in 2010 \u2013 her photographs\u00a0have been exhibited at the V&A, Tate Modern, Saatchi Gallery and Photographers' Gallery, among others. Many of the other names associated with the fashion and photography of The Face became central to the fashion-celebrity industrial complex \u2013 not least, of course, Kate Moss, as iconic as ever. Swillingham went on to work at Vogue with Edward Enninful (who had been at fellow style magazine ID). Photographers including\u00a0Ellen von Unwerth, Nigel Shafran, Kevin Davies, David Sims, Glen Luchford, Juergen Teller, Inez & Vinoodh, Elaine Constantine and others went on to have profitable careers in the commercial world, \"at the centre of the contemporary fashion industry\" says Swillingham, who is now consultant art director of Harper\u2019s Bazaar Italia and has his own creative agency, Suburbia. As Bicker \u2013\u00a0 now an international, award-winning creative director \u2013 puts it: \"Ultimately the only way the industry could take some control over the young disruptors was to embrace its protagonists.\"\nIt is perhaps difficult to imagine now in our digital age, but there was a sense of cultural cohesion about this time \u2013 and the way it was distilled and chronicled \u2013 that we won't see again. As McRobbie puts it: \"The Face marks out a pathway to social fragmentation. There was a coherence which was impressive about The Face, and that has been dismantled in the digital age, which is a loss.\" Swillingham loved the \"ephemeral\" nature of things then, and remembers his time at The Face as the most exciting job he ever had: \"We didn't have time to think about it, we were in it.\"\nThe Face Magazine: Culture Shift is at the National Portrait Gallery, London from 20 February to 18 May.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola describes him as a 'mini-Rodri' but could Nico Gonzalez end up having a huge impact on what is left of Manchester City's season?\nThe \u00a350m midfielder's impressive display on his Premier League debut, Saturday's 4-0 win over top-four rivals Newcastle, brought the Rodri comparison from his beaming manager and impressed former City defender Micah Richards, who analysed Gonzalez for MOTD2.\n\"Gonzalez gave City the control they have been missing, with and without the ball,\" said Richards.\n\"That made a massive difference to the whole team, and he was a positive influence on the players around him too.\"\nNext up is an even tougher test, but could the 23-year-old Spaniard have a similar effect against Real Madrid on Wednesday, and help City turn around a Champions League play-off tie where they trail 3-2 after the first leg?\n\"The balance of the team looks much, much better already with Gonzalez in it,\" Richards added.\n\"City have got players who can score goals and hurt Real, but he brings some stability behind them, which they will need if they are to manage the game in Madrid.\n\"Do they have more chance of beating Real with him in the starting XI? Without a doubt.\"\nGonzalez made his Premier League debut against Newcastle. He may have been described as being a 'mini-Rodri' but at 6ft 2in he is only one inch shorter than his new City team-mate\nOne of the re-occurring themes of City's calamitous campaign is how often they have been cut open on the counter-attack since Rodri was injured in September.\nGuardiola has tried plenty of other players in the number six role, without replacing Rodri's calm authority in the heart of midfield, which was a hallmark of his team and helped them win trophy after trophy.\nAgainst Newcastle, it was different. City often stopped breakaways early, in the opposition half, with Gonzalez - a former Barcelona trainee who arrived at Etihad Stadium from Porto at the end of the January transfer window - seeing the threat early and expertly pouncing to snuff it out.\nThis video can not be played\nGonzales was 'our mini-Rodri' during big Man City win - Guardiola\n\"I saw a couple of situations against Newcastle where, in previous games, City would have been in big trouble,\" Richards explained.\n\"In the past, they were playing the ball forward to the edge of the opposition box, losing it, then someone in midfield would get turned and suddenly the defence was having to drop back rapidly from the halfway line because the opposition were running through unchallenged.\n\"That did not happen on Gonzalez's watch because he did not just stop counter-attacks when they happened, he anticipated the danger so they never happened in the first place.\n\"In one of the clips I picked out for MOTD2, he starts sprinting forward to pick up the second ball before the Newcastle defender on the edge of their area has even headed clear.\n\"Gonzalez is not just sitting deep, waiting, instead he gets up the pitch and into the right position to stop a group of Newcastle players getting on the ball and springing a break.\nCity play a high ball up to Phil Foden but it is about to be headed away, beyond Foden and Erling Haaland who is stood by the referee. Gonzalez (highlighted) has already started running to where he thinks the ball will go...\n... Gonzalez is right, and he collects the ball before three Newcastle players can react and quickly feeds it to Josko Gvardiol (number 24) to his left\n\"That was not the only time he made a difference defensively.\n\"There was another clip I chose from the Newcastle game which was a mirror image of how City conceded their second goal against Juventus in their Champions League defeat in Turin in December.\n\"A City attack had just broken down and Ilkay Gundogan, who was playing as the deepest midfielder, got pulled across to the right, leaving a big hole in the middle for Juve to drive through, with only the defence to deal with it.\nAgainst Juve, Gundogan was drawn over to cover behind Kyle Walker (number 2) who is the City player nearest the ball on the right...\n... but Juve quickly switched the ball into the space inside, and drove forward. Rico Lewis has come inside from the left, leaving space on his flank - where the cross for Juve's second goal comes from\n\"This time, however, Gonzalez leaves the runner to his left and he is not worried about him. Instead he reads the play and - bam! - he goes straight in for the challenge in the centre of the pitch to stop the counter. \n\"It's perfect midfield play, because he does not jump too early either. His timing is excellent, and he gets the ball back, with energy and purpose.\"\nAgainst Newcastle, Gonzalez leaves his man, who is running out to the right and switches his attention to the Newcastle players in the centre...\n... this time, when Newcastle play the ball inside, there is no gap for them to run through. Gonzalez reads the danger and is across to engage and win the ball back for City \nGonzalez was forced off injured on his City debut, last week's FA Cup win at Leyton Orient. He was hurt when he was caught on the ball, seconds before Jamie Donley's stunning long-range strike, which cannoned off the bar and went in via Stefan Ortega, put the home side ahead.\nOn Saturday, he lasted the full match, topping the ranking from both teams for most touches [114] and passes [103], with a 97% success rate.\nGonzalez attempted 103 passes against Newcastle, and completed 100 of them. He played 15 passes into the final third, more than any other player\nHis careful use of the ball helped give City the control of possession that Guardiola craves - they enjoyed 62% of it against the Magpies - but he was brave with his distribution too.\n\"There were times when Gonzalez took out three or four Newcastle players with one pass forward,\" Richards added. \"That's another thing City have been missing when they are starting attacks, or facing packed defences, someone who can break the lines from deep like that.\n\"Most of the time, though, you might have looked at his passing and think well he is actually not doing anything special. He was just in the right position, recycling the ball and keeping things moving.\n\"Again, though, that's exactly what City have needed this season, because there have been too many games where they have not starved the opposition of the ball the way they would in the past.\n\"I loved how Gonzalez has got the personality to come to the Premier League and play like this, straight away, against a team renowned for their physicality and intensity in midfield.\n\"As well as character, he also had the intelligence to know when to take a chance, and when to just hold on to the ball. Having someone with that kind of football IQ in your team is priceless.\"\nIt was striking to see exactly where Gonzalez got on the ball, with none of his touches taking place in the final third of the pitch.\nFor Richards, that was further evidence that he was constantly thinking about his role in the side, and also showed how he might think differently to Mateo Kovacic and Ilkay Gundogan, who have both filled in for Rodri as a defensive midfielder but had to wrestle with their attacking instincts.\n\"I think Gonzalez can get forward and into the box if he wants to,\" Richards added. \"Rodri always did that too - he scored nine goals last season.\n\"But on Saturday he wasn't worried about getting forward, he was just thinking about what was best for the team - looking at where the space was and filling the gaps at the right moments in midfield, whether City had the ball or not.\n\"That was great for his team-mates, because they knew they had him giving that protection behind them, and it particularly benefited Rico Lewis.\n\"Without Rodri alongside him, Rico has often seemed like he is stuck between a rock and a hard place. While his form has not been at the level we saw when he first broke into the team, he has found the role that Pep asks him to perform much more difficult this season.\n\"When City play with four at the back and Lewis is right-back, he is asked to come inside to create an overload in midfield.\nGraphic showing the average position of touches by each Manchester City player against Newcastle on Saturday. Nico Gonzales is number 14 and Rico Lewis is number 82\n\"Without Rodri, and before Gonzalez signed, Lewis was coming into midfield too early, and getting stuck in those central areas. Against Newcastle, however, he had Gonzalez behind him and it allowed him to get forward quicker, and give City more options out wide on the right.\n\"On top of that, Gonzalez helped Lewis defensively too, although City's dominance against Newcastle meant this was not as easy to spot.\n\"Lewis is still a defender, first and foremost, so when City have been losing the ball in the areas I spoke about earlier, he has to decide whether to get back in his right-back slot, or stay in midfield.\n\"It actually happened on the opposite flank for the Juventus goal I mentioned earlier, when he was at left-back but came across into midfield and left space out wide. With Rodri there, he does not have to come inside when attacks break down, and the same applies with Gonzalez in the team too.\n\"I loved the way Gonzalez seemed aware of exactly where to be at all times, and he also had the legs to get there quickly when he had to.\n\"That energy and physicality is something else City have lacked in their midfield, and it is another reason he looks like a gem of a player, who was the perfect signing for Pep.\n\"Going forward, he's going to be an important player alongside Rodri, not just instead of him. \n\"He definitely gives City more hope against Madrid, too. They are not the favourites, but of course they still have a chance of getting through.\"",

        "article_text": "Pope drama Conclave and immigration epic The Brutalist walked away with some of the biggest prizes at the Bafta film awards on Sunday.\nConclave, made by German director Edward Berger, picked up four awards in total including best film and best British film; the first time a movie has won both in the same year since the 2019 war drama, 1917. It also won best adapted screenplay and best editing.\nUS filmmaker Brady Corbet's The Brutalist also won four - Corbet picked up best director while Adrien Brody won best actor for his portrayal of Hungarian architect and Holocaust survivor,  L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th. The film also won best original score and cinematography.\nOther winners included Mikey Madison (best actress, for Anora), Kieran Culkin (best supporting actor, for A Real Pain) and Zoe Salda\u00f1a (best supporting actress, for Emilia P\u00e9rez).\n\nAnora, about a New York stripper who has a whirlwind romance with the son of a Russian oligarch, had been picking up best picture momentum ahead of the Oscars next month - but instead came away with best actress and best casting.\nThe best actress win for Madison was something of a surprise, despite her impressive performance in Sean Baker's film. Madison herself, on accepting the prize, said: \"Wow, I really wasn't expecting this. I probably should have listened to my publicist  and written a speech or something!\"\nThe 25-year-old starred in US comedy series Better Things and also had roles in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and horror film Scream. But her leading role in Anora has catapulted her into the spotlight.\nMadison added: \"I want to take a moment to recognise the sex worker community. I see you, you deserve respect and human decency. I will always be an ally and a friend.\"\nDemi Moore, who stars in body horror The Substance, has been picking up best actress prizes in the last couple of months, including at the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards.\nMany thought she would win the Bafta, too. She will still be a favourite at the Oscars although Madison's Bafta win does make things more interesting.\nThe Substance only picked up one win on Sunday for make-up and hair. The film sees a TV aerobics presenter in her 50s (Moore) who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself. Full of gory effects, the film is the favourite to pick up the same prize at next month's Oscars.\n\n\nConclave, about a a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals who gather in Rome to elect a new Pope, which stars Ralph Fiennes, had led the charge with 12 nominations.\nBerger said he was \"deeply moved\" to win best film, and that winning outstanding British film, was \"a huge, huge honour\".\n\"Best British and I'm not even from here, so I feel so welcome in your midst,\" he added.\nBafta rules state that films in this category \"must have significant creative involvement by individuals who are British\".\nBerger added that we \"live in a time of a crisis of democracy\", and ended his speech by quoting Leonard Cohen, saying: \"There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in.\"\nBrody, collecting his best actor win, told the audience The Brutalist \"is really about the pursuit of leaving something meaningful\", while Corbet said he was \"humbled and very grateful\".\nThe ceremony was hosted by David Tennant at London's Royal Festival Hall. The actor wore a kilt and opened the ceremony by belting out The Proclaimers' classic song, I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), joined by other stars including James McAvoy and Colman Domingo.\nIn what has been an unpredictable awards season, the Baftas followed a similar pattern, with no single film sweeping the board, and several movies sharing the spoils.\nThis was the third year in a row that no British stars won any of the four acting prizes at the most prestigious night in the British film calendar.\nFilms that had multiple nominations but lost out on the night included A Complete Unknown, the Bob Dylan biopic starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Nosferatu, Blitz, Gladiator II and The Apprentice.\n\nEmilia P\u00e9rez, the French-made film, about a dangerous Mexican drug lord who decides to leave the world of crime and live a new life as a woman, has been the subject of controversy in recent weeks. Offensive social media posts by its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, were unearthed.\nSome wondered if the saga would affect its chances. With 11 nominations, it ended up winning best international film alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a's win. She is now a favourite to replicate her Bafta win at next month's Oscars. \nOn accepting the international film prize, the film's director, Jacques Audiard, thanked the cast, including Gascon, as did Salda\u00f1a.\nKieran Culkin's win for a A Real Pain was widely expected. The award was collected by his co-star and the film's writer and director, Jesse Eisenberg.\nEisenberg's film, about two cousins who explore their Jewish grandmother's roots in Poland, also picked up the award for best original screenplay.\nActor and TV presenter Warwick Davis was awarded the Bafta Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the British Academy. He thanked his mother - his \"first agent\" and his \"wonderful wife Sammy who died almost a year ago\". \nThe In Memoriam segment, which honours those from the film community who we have lost in the past year, paid tribute to the likes of Dame Maggie Smith, James Earl Jones, David Lynch, Dame Joan Plowright and Donald Sutherland.\nOther winners included Denis Villeneuve's Dune Part 2, which won special effects and sound.\nBlockbuster musical film Wicked won best production design for Brits Nathan Crowley and Lee Sandales. It was Crowley's first Bafta and his sixth nomination, although Sandales has won twice previously. It also picked up best costume design.\nAardman's latest Wallace and Gromit film, Vengeance Most Fowl, won best animation - perhaps surprisingly, it's the first time they have won this award. They also picked up the inaugural award for best children and family film. \n\nWest Belfast rap group Kneecap won the Bafta for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.\nThe Irish-language film is based on a semi-fictionalised account of how the band was formed.\nThe film's English director, Rich Peppiatt, said on accepting the prize: \"Kneecap is more than a film, it's a movement,\" adding that everyone should have their language and culture respected.\nSuper/Man: The Christopher Reeve story, a film about the life of the Superman star who was paralysed in a horse riding accident 10  years before his death in 2004, won best documentary.

        "article_text": "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.\nBut, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.\nThis is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".\n\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.\nAfter a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.\nHer audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. \nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.\nShe rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \n\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.\nIt affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.\nOther audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.\nFive NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.\nAPD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.\nHer team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"\nNoise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.\nLisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \n\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.\n\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.\n\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.\nFor those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.\nA UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.\nAnd, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.\nProf Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"\nParticularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown. \nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.\nDr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \n\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"\nDr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. \nHe said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.\nSo-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.\nMicrophones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.\n\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.\n\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"\nTo improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\nWayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.\nHowever, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky. \n\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"\nSophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future. \n\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

        "article_text": "Pathfinder 1, bankrolled by a Google billionaire, is an attempt to revive the airship. A century after terrifying disasters, is a safe-enough bet?\nOn 24 October 2024, a brief post was shared on the social media network LinkedIn. In it Google co-founder Sergey Brin's airship company LTA Research finally announced Pathfinder 1's first if brief untethered flight at Nasa's Moffett Field in California, part of the space agency's Ames Research Center. \"This morning, Pathfinder 1 reached another milestone: untethered outdoor flight. This successful test marks another important step in our journey, and we are excited to build on this achievement through our rigorous testing program.\"\nAirships are hard to hide. Despite the secrecy, one YouTuber filmed it from the road and uploaded it to the video-sharing site.\u00a0\n\"Pathfinder 1 is a pretty amazing vehicle,\" says Alan Shrimpton, editor of the Airship Journal. \"It is the first fully rigid airship, certainly of that size, for a very long time, and there was a great expectation that it would fly shortly after it began its outdoor testing programme.\n\"But Alan Weston [founder and former CEO of LTA Research] always said the biggest fault with rigid airships was that people in the past rushed their development and they were not going to make that same mistake. They were going to check it and check it again \u2013 and they did.\"\nThe understated tone in LTA's post belies the historic achievements of Brin's company so far. This was the first flight of the first airship built by the Google cofounder's company, the first time a classic rigid airship of this size had flown since the 1930s, and the first of a new generation of airships. The last giant rigid airship Graf Zeppelin II flew for the final time on 20 August 1939, 12 days before World War Two started, and was scrapped the following year. Rigid airships have a complex metal framework that supports a huge envelope filled with enough hydrogen or helium to lift a sizeable number of passengers, or cargo such as disaster relief, for days at a time.\u00a0\nHydrogen-filled airships are also symbols of the Golden Age of the airship. The era between the world wars when the promoters of the technology beguiled the public with promises of scheduled commercial passenger services between destinations like Europe and North America, and North America and the Pacific, and in some cases delivered on these promises. The Graf Zeppelin flew \"the first regularly scheduled, nonstop, intercontinental airline service in the history of the world\" between Germany and South America, and was far faster than ocean liners that plied the route.\nBut the crash of the airship Hindenburg in 1937 \u2013 which killed 36 people including one person on the ground \u2013 showed the drawbacks of the flammable gas used as buoyancy. The airship faded into obscurity; just as conventional aircraft design surged ahead.\nEighty-six years later in\u00a0November 2023, Pathfinder 1 emerged for the first time from the historic Hangar Two at Moffett Field to begin its outdoor flight-testing programme. But the largest aircraft in the world stayed stubbornly tethered to the ground to the frustration of many aviation enthusiasts. Its expected first flight just didn't happen.\nBut thanks to the Google co-founder's deep pockets, LTA Research appears to\u00a0 have the freedom to wait-to-get-it-right that others have not always had.\nThey have used this freedom to, for example, find better materials than lightweight aluminum alloys like duralumin to construct the giant frame of a rigid airship from, and cotton-composite materials and even cow guts to make the envelope out of, and gain a much better understanding of aerodynamics involved in flying very large airships. And it seems like they have \u00a0been able to cautiously flight test their creation, without the over confidence and pressure from investors that have been a problem in the past.\n\"People said that they could not do it and that it was impossible,\" says Janne Hietala, CEO of Kelluu Airships, whose 10 autonomous drones, each of which can be transported in a 12m (40ft) sea container, are currently \"the world's largest\" fleet of airships. \"This is a brilliant, very bold attempt to do the hard work, the engineering that is required, to mass-manufacture big airships. I don't think they will build hundreds of those because of the difficulties in mass-manufacturing airships of that size, but it's still possible.\"\nPathfinder 1 is not a historical replica. It is a proof-of-concept airship designed to see if a rigid design can be updated with new materials.\u00a0\nIn particular, LTA Research wants to solve the thorny problem of how to mass produce aircraft of this size. It wants to build production models in Goodyear Airdock in Akron, Iowa where the great US rigid airships of the 1930s were built.\n\"I've been down to Moffett Field to see Pathfinder 1 twice, and it is really an amazing thing to see in person,\" says John Geoghegan, author of When Giants Ruled the Sky. \"It's very impressive to be able to see the learning they have made from the past even from the outside.\"\u00a0\nThe fact that the giant rigid airship does not have tail fins in the traditional cross shape, but at an angle, is an example of such learning, because airships float up and down on a mooring mast and the bottom tail fin used to get damaged. Likewise, the airship's engines are no longer inline but staggered along its length to reduce the wind, drag and vibration that they used to cause. Like many other new designs, it uses helium as a lifting gas to prevent the infernos that doomed the Golden Age of the airship.\nHelium is less flammable than hydrogen, but there is a trade-off for this increased safety. It generates less lift than hydrogen, and it is in short supply. This makes it very expensive to fill the envelope of an airship with.\n\"There's a lot of baggage around airships, and a lot of people who have pre-set ideas about them, and so these guys are being incredibly careful and extremely cautious about the information they release,\" Geoghegan adds. \"They do not want to do anything to contribute any more negative publicity. For the public always remember the airship disasters and not the successful flights.\"\nPathfinder 1's first untethered flight also has significance for the wider lighter-than-air community, which has for a long time had little more than glossy CGI graphics of large airships to show investors. That it has occurred at a time when high-profile airship companies such as Flying Whales \"appear to be struggling to\u2026 build a flagship production facility\" is a good morale boost for the sector, says Shrimpton.\n\"Investors tell so many people going out to try to get funding for their lighter-than-air projects that yes, it's interesting, I can see the benefits of it, but show me one that is flying today\u2026 now they can.\"\n\"It is fantastic that LTA Research is making so much progress using modern technology to solve these problems,\" says Diana Little, co-founder of airship startup Anum\u00e1 Aerospace. \"It reminds people about the capabilities of lighter-than-air flight.\n\"Aviation is an industry desperately looking for a decarbonisation solution and airships are part of that solution,\" Little adds.\nThe first flight of Pathfinder 1 has been at least 12 years in the making. Brin's interest in airships seems to have begun in 2012 around the same time as a modern semi-rigid Zeppelin NT (New Technology) airship began tourist flights from Moffett Field.\nThe following year he founded LTA Research Ltd and in 2017 his airship company began to lease space at Moffett Field and research began at the Akron Airdock. There they built a 12-engine, 50ft-long (15m) electric \"baby airship\" to test their technology.\nNo one had built aircraft like these giant rigid airships for decades. So, it took time for the engineers to learn how to do this, particularly with a focus on safety and not repeating the mistakes of the past. In the 1930s, the materials used to create the such rigid airship's framework and envelope which were simply not strong enough to deal with the stresses of flight.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe use of computerised controls, new and much stronger lightweight materials like carbon fibre and titanium to construct the complex skeleton of the rigid airship are just some of the ways the giant rigid airship has been brought into the 21st Century. So too are the use of flame-retardant synthetic materials for the envelope of the airship, sensors to monitor the helium and engines that can be rotated to provide vectored thrust.\nThe knowledge and skills of the great engineers of the past had to be relearned by LTA \u2013 together with the latest research and technology \u2013 in order to design the airship and work out how to mass produce even larger craft in the future. Rather than expect their engineers to work at the top of unsteady 85ft-high (26m) ladders to build these ships like they did in the 1930s, LTA have designed a massive cradle-like structure that allows the workers to stay on the ground while the giant ships are slowly rotated in front of them. To do this they needed to find the skilled workers who were willing to join a risky project that may one day make aviation history, and are continuing to seek them today.\nIn 2017 work started at Moffett Field on LTA's smallest airship Pathfinder 1, and planning began in Akron on the Pathfinder 3, its successor which is planned to be one-third-larger. (There is no Pathfinder 2.)\nBut a fully-fledged return of large airships is not yet a given. \"I am crossing my fingers,\" says Shrimpton, \"but if Pathfinder 1 suffered a failure in flight everybody would point to it and say, 'See once again, a large airship crashes \u2013 it is not safe,' which would provide an almost insurmountable hurdle for the whole passenger/cargo-carrying airship industry.\"\nThe same applies to other airship companies, such as Flying Whales, whose airship has not even been built yet. \"They need to get over that same hurdle and prove to the public that they have a vehicle that is safe, like LTA Research is doing.\"\nGeoghegan is more sanguine about it. \"Interest in airships is cyclical,\" he says. \"Every 10 or 15 years a company comes along that is working in the airship category and a couple more sprout up. Some get prototypes flying. But none of them ever pan out.\n\"So, there is a lot of skittishness among the investor community about building these things. It is in part about the technology, is it robust enough to work. Then, second, what is the business application? Is there a market that exists that would financially support airships on this scale?\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The giant hangar poised for an aviation revolution\n\u2022 The huge shed built for an Arctic airship\n\u2022 How airships could return to our crowded skies\n\"We keep hearing the same things trotted out. One is for tourism. One is for disaster relief. One is that it will be a green, non-polluting alternative to conventional aircraft, and the fourth one is specialised cargo.\n\"But I remain to be convinced that there's an economic case for these things.\"\nThe engineering challenges that LTA faces certainly remain significant.\n\"In the end, for LTA Research it is proof that their design worked, and a milestone for their staff, who worked tirelessly for three or four years to bring the design to fruition,\" says Shrimpton. But Pathfinder could have much wider implications if it successfully takes to the skies. \"It is really important. It is something the whole airship industry needs \u2013 to be seen in the sky.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Just over a year ago, Chloe Cheung was sitting her A-levels. Now she's on a Chinese government list of wanted dissidents.\nThe choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($100,000; \u00a3105,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad.\n\"I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school,\" Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. \"But I've ended up with a bounty!\"\nChloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago.\nIn 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels.\nHer protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the caf\u00e9 in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest.\nHong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her \u2013 in which she is aged 11.\n\"It freaked me out at first,\" she says, but then she fired back a public response.\n\"I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them.\"\nChloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997.\n\"Politics were never in my life before\u2026 so I went to the first protest with curiosity,\" she said.\nShe saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck.\n\"I was so shocked,\" she says. \"That moment actually changed how I looked at the world.\"\nGrowing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms \u2013 she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about \"what we like and don't like\" and  \"could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like\".\nBut the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge.\n\"I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],\" she says. But when things started to get \"really crazy\",  she browbeat her parents into coming with her.\nAt the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the \"raw experience\", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV.\nAfter months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020. Suddenly, most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies \u2013 were gone.\nSymbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail.\nIn response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown.\nAt first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around.\nUnable to afford international student fees of more than \u00a320,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO.\nWhen China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians. Chloe, still finishing her A-levels at the time, thought was she too small-fry to ever be a target.\nHer inclusion underlines Beijing's determination to pursue activists overseas.\nThe bounty puts a target on her back and encourages third parties to report on her actions in the UK, she says.\nChina has been the leading country over the past decade trying to silence exiled dissidents around the world, according to a report this week. \nAnother Hong Kong dissident who reported being assaulted in London blamed the attacks on Chinese government-linked actors.\nAnd last May, British police charged three men with gathering intelligence for Hong Kong and breaking into a home. One of the men was soon after found dead in unclear circumstances.\n\"They're only interested in Hong Kongers because they want to scare off others,\" Chloe says.\nShe says many of those who've moved over in recent years stay quiet, partly because they still have family in Hong Kong.\n\"Most of the BNO visa holders told me this because they don't want to take risks,\" she says. \"It's sad but we can't blame them.\"\nOn the day her arrest warrant was announced, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would not tolerate \"any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas\". He added the government was committed to supporting Hong Kongers in the UK.\nBut more needs to be done, says Chloe, who's spent the first weeks of this year lobbying Westminster.\nIn the past fortnight she has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Lunar New Year event at Downing Street, and shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who later tweeted: \"We must not give an inch to any transnational repression in the UK.\" \nBut she worries whether the UK's recent overtures to China could mean fewer protections for Hong Kongers.\n\"We just don't know what will happen to us, and whether the British government will protect us if they really want to protect their trade relationship with China.\"\nDoes she feel scared on the streets in London? It's not as bad as what activists back home face, she says. \n\"When I think of what [they] face\u2026 it's actually not that big a deal that I got a bounty overseas.\"\nBounty targets",

Somebody has worked hard to get it good,\" she said.\n\"I think if they just add a little more honesty when they are visiting these places, I think that is definitely needed.\"\nAshley French, an owner of the restaurants French Village and Orto in Belfast, said that influencers are a \"mixed bag\".\n\"It depends who it is really; there are ones who are genuine\u2026 then you have others who are potentially just wanting an invite to the opening of an envelope,\" he said.\nMr French said that while his restaurants will often be visited by influencers, he doesn't invite them or offer them payment or a discounted meal.\n\"Our feeling is that we would rather look after the paying public\".\nHe said that people are more likely to decide to eat at his restaurants based on word of mouth than social media.\nJohnny Mooney and Ben Kane, the content creators behind @foodandcraic, told BBC News NI that they \"definitely\" don't consider themselves food critics.\nMr Kane said they make videos purely \"to talk highly about places that we enjoy\".\n\"If we don't enjoy the experience, we don't post it,\" Mr Mooney added. \n\"Our content allows you to visually see what you're getting... so the opinion you'll form from our content will probably be more well-rounded than from written [content],\" he said.\nMs Jackson said branded is \"very important\" to help influencers \"stay afloat\".\nBut she added that she won't recommend something that she didn't enjoy in paid-for reviews.\nEd Senior, a compliance executive at the Advertising Standards Agency, told BBC News NI that the \"whole point\" of influencer marketing is that people can \"produce advertising in a style that they know their followers connect with because it's the same as their editorial content\".\n\"For us that's why it's exceptionally important that actually when it is advertising that it's absolutely clear that it's disclosed as such,\" he added.\nHe said that if a brand asks a creator to make content and pays them either with money or with a free or discounted meal, then it should be classified as advertising. \nHe said that once something is disclosed as advertising, it also needs to meet certain regulations, including whether it is \"accurate and fair\".\nAlongside work educating creators, Mr Senior said that \"targeted enforcement action, when necessary against those [creators] who are established, helps to bring about compliance from the sector as a whole\".",

        "article_text": "As White Lotus season three is released, executive producer Mark Kamine explains the behind-the-scenes wrangling and key challenges when choosing a filming location.\nIt's being called the \"White Lotus effect\": the way that major TV shows influence the way we travel, thanks to the hit TV show that's back on 16 February 2025.\nThe black comedy-drama, written by Mike White, is in a new location for a third season, following the guests and staff of fictional five-star resort, the White Lotus. The dark drama satirises the excesses of the rich, set against the struggles of the staff, in a glamorous setting.\u00a0\nIt's thrilling, pacey stuff with beautiful people, gripping action and a tense setup that tells you from episode one, that although this looks like paradise, something terrible is going to happen. In the first season, a coffin is unloaded from a plane; while in the second, a body is discovered floating in the sea by a guest. Season three's trailer is peppered with shots of guns and whispers of body bags amid the palm trees and luxury spa treatments.\nDespite the gory details and the lampooning of the rich, everyone wants to stay at the White Lotus. When it was announced mid 2024 that Thailand would be the location for the TV show's third season, global interest in travel to the country soared, with booking platforms reporting immediate increases in searches, and airlines including Finnair adding extra weekly flights to Phuket. Hotels.com reported a 40% spike in booking interest for the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui, one of the filming locations.\u00a0\nThe expectations come with a precedent: the Sicilian hotel, the Four Seasons San Domenico Palace in Taormina, Sicily, where season two was filmed, reported it was booked out for six months when it reopened after filming and continues to attract guests wanting a slice of the White Lotus lifestyle. The original White Lotus, the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, Hawaii, said it saw a 425% uptick year on year in website visits and 386% increase in availability checks.\nThe White Lotus isn't the first drama to have an outsized effect on the travel industry \u2013 the impact of films like Lord of the Rings and The Sound of Music on tourism has been well documented, as has the much-criticised Emily in Paris. But what's interesting right now, in the digital age, is how quickly news about a streamed TV show setting can have an impact.\n\"Back in 2015, research showed that around one in five people coming to Britain were coming because of something they'd seen on TV,\" said screen tourism specialist Seren Welch. \"Fast forward to now, and the latest Visit Britain research shows that nine in 10 visitors to the UK are influenced by what they have seen in film and TV. It's unheard of.\"\u00a0\nThis rise is down to the prevalence of streaming platforms: as Welch notes, 10 years ago, we didn't have Disney+ and Netflix was a lesser phenomenon. Today, streaming algorithms are powerful drivers of our behaviour far beyond the screen, with the opportunity to binge-watch everything anywhere leading viewers to be ever more immersed.\n\"I've heard a British Airways exec say that when they see a spike in traffic to a destination, they look at what's peaking on Netflix to explain it,\" Welch said.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen it comes to planning a location for a TV show like The White Lotus, Mark Kamine knows a thing or two. Kamine, one of The White Lotus's executive producers, started his career as a location scout working on all six seasons of The Sopranos, along with film credits on Hollywood films including Ted, American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook.\nHis new book On Locations: Lessons Learned From my Life on Set with the Sopranos and in the Film Industry details the behind-the-scenes wrangling inherent in location work, from negotiating with strip club owners keen to do under-the-table deals, to pacifying home owners who have just found out you've staged a mafia killing in their house. It's a lively read, running through the behind-the-scenes production level details about how to make one destination stand in for another on the tightest of tight budgets.\nWhile many of Kamine's previous film and TV productions have had financial issues constraining filming locations, when it came to The White Lotus, the wild success of the first seasons meant that when deciding the location for season three, there was plenty of choice.\u00a0\n\"Mike White had the idea for something around Eastern philosophy,\" Kamine explained. \"We were looking for what was practical and eye-catching, and to start with, Korea, Philippines, Japan, Bali and Sri Lanka were in the mix, as well as Thailand.\"\u00a0\nFurther discussion and research narrowed the choice to Japan and Thailand, with White and Kamine and others making research trips to see what would work best. (White typically stays in the resort to write and research the show ahead of production.)\nKamine notes in his book that the key challenges faced by location scouts centre on budgets: productions often end up being shot in dupe locations, where, for example, Prague might stand in for New Jersey, because even when subsidised, US locations can't compete with European, Asian or African crew and material costs. But for a sure-fire hit like The White Lotus, which had a reported $38.5m budget for season two and drew in 4.1 million US viewers for its finale, Karmine and his team chose the option that reflected the story they wanted to tell best, rather than make a financial compromise.\n\"Mike said that he feels like we've cracked the code,\" Kamine admitted, \"in that we've figured out how to stay in these luxury locations and create great TV. What a life.\"\nThe new series is filmed in the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui, with the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok, Anantara Mai Khao Phuket Villas and Anantara Bophut Koh Samui Resort also featured \u2013 along with a little creative licence.\u00a0\n\"Anyone who has been to the Four Seasons in Sicily that we used in the show will know that the beach isn't where it seems to be,\" said Kamine. \"Some scenes in season three are shot at one hotel, and some aspects are filmed elsewhere. The common spaces need to have real impact, that's a driver here. Overall, the main thing is that it looks beautiful.\"\u00a0\nThe White Lotus team are aware of the impact the filming has on future bookings and the local tourism scene. Kamine says he keeps in touch with the hotel managers from the previous series and is aware of the debate around overtourism, noting that these popular five-star locations already have existing tourism infrastructure and have been developed to handle a certain number of visitors.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0White Lotus 3 Thailand filming locations revealed\n\u2022\u00a0The White Lotus season three review\n\u2022\u00a0'Set-jetting': How on-screen locations are becoming travel destinations\nHowever, given that films shot in Thailand have driven a surge of tourism in the past \u2013\u00a0the extreme popularity of The Beach caused Maya Bay to close, for instance \u2013\u00a0it's somewhat surprising to find that Thailand has no plan in place to mitigate a potential tourism surge from the show. A spokesperson from Tourism Thailand noted that the country is still trying to build back its tourism industry following Covid, and that since the show airs in Thailand's shoulder season, it is most likely to boost tourism numbers in these quieter months when there is more capacity than in peak season.\nThe White Lotus isn't the only streaming show boosting holiday bookings. As set-jetting continues to be a popular motif in the travel industry, new series including Yellowstone prequel 1923, set in Montana, are expected to drive more tourism. It's not without its problems: in 2023, The Washington Post reported that Yellowstone has driven tourism to the region but has brought with it misconceptions: it does rain, it can be cold, and not everyone is as well dressed as the show would have you believe. That's showbusiness.\nSeason two of Wednesday, also releasing this year, is a good case in point: the show is set in a fictional town in Vermont but season one was shot in Romania and season two filmed in Ireland. The final season of Stranger Things will air later this year as well, set in the town of Hawkins, Indiana but filmed in Jackson, Georgia. It's a known filming location \u2013 The Walking Dead and The Vampire Diaries were also shot there \u2013 and the local tourism authority already has information on how to follow the shows around town. Tellingly, it notes that \"the upside down is NOT included\".\nAs for The White Lotus, now that season three is out, thoughts are turning to season four. Kamine wouldn't confirm or deny any location currently under discussion for the next series but did let slip that one thing is important: going back perhaps to his Soprano days, it needs to be somewhere where it's easy to dump a body.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "After fleeing conflict in South Sudan, James Lokidichi hopes to race over 1500m or 5,000m at the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games\nA scar on the right side of James Lokidichi's head serves as a permanent reminder of the conflict he fled when he was a child, carrying his younger brother with him.\nYet pain remains buried deeper inside as, holding back tears, he recounts the day in 2011 that family members were killed by armed men and he was forced from his home in what is now South Sudan.\n\"They shot my dad and my uncle in front of me,\" the 23-year-old told BBC Sport Africa.\n\"They burnt the house and I got burnt too while I was crying for my dad and uncle. They shot my mum in the hand. She ran away and left us.\n\"I grabbed my brother when my mum ran away. They [the fighters] said 'Leave these boys'.\"\nThe pair have not seen their mother since.\nThe brothers eventually found their way to neighbouring Kenya, and Lokidichi is now one of almost 300,000 residents in the Kakuma Refugee Camp., external\nAfter his childhood trauma, he believes sport can be a stepping stone to a better life and is chasing a place in the Refugee Olympic Team (ROT).\nThe middle-distance runner was among over 100 attendees at trials at the Lornah Kiplagat Sports Academy on the outskirts of Iten last week, when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was scouting talented runners, judokas and taekwondo athletes to support via scholarships.\nLokidichi, inspired by Kenyan marathon great Eliud Kipchoge, hopes to provide motivation for fellow residents in the refugee camp in the north-west of the country.\n\"When we get successful, we will go assist those who remained behind. We will advise others in the camp,\" he said.\n\"We will demonstrate to them there is help and hope for the future. We keep on fighting together as a team.\"\nLaurence Namukiza, originally from DR Congo, wants to represent the Refugee Olympic Team in Senegal next year and also aspires to become a pilot\nThe ROT made their inaugural appearance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in 2016.\nCameroon-born Cindy Ngamba became the team's first medal winner when she took bronze in the women's middleweight boxing at Paris 2024.\nA refugee squad is now being assembled for the Dakar 2026 Youth Olympics - the first major IOC event to be staged on African soil.\nTeenager Laurence Namukiza hopes to secure a place among that group, and her three taekwondo victories at the trials could help her achieve that aim.\nThe 15-year-old is a student at a school in Kakuma that was established by and named after Hollywood actor Angelina Jolie, a United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) goodwill ambassador.\nThe hardship of life in the camp - where monthly handouts to residents were reduced from 1,500 Kenyan shillings ($11.60, \u00a39.20) to 950 Ksh ($7.40, \u00a35.80) per month - compelled Namukiza to take up the discipline when it was introduced to her school in the middle of last year.\n\"I promised myself I will perform well so that I am able to assist my family,\" she said.\n\"You will find a family of 16 but the food distributed is for five people.\n\"Getting work is difficult if you do not have a formal education and certificates. My mum [is] suffering to feed us.\n\"When I am successful, I will get them out of Kakuma to a better place.\"\nNamukiza won all three of her matches in the girls' 54kg category with calculated attacks\nNamukiza was still a baby when her family were forced to leave their home in Uvira, DR Congo, in 2010.\nThe fourth-born in a family of nine children, taekwondo has instilled the values of discipline and resilience.\nIt has also helped her challenge gender stereotypes and provided self-defence skills.\n\"I remember people telling me 'Why are you taking up this sport?

It was applauded as a historic milestone in global climate action.\nBarely a year later, however, there are fears that the global commitment may be losing momentum, as the growth of clean energy transition is slowing down while burning of fossil fuels continues to rise.\nAnd now there is US President Donald Trump's \"national energy emergency\", embracing fossil fuels and ditching clean energy policies  \u2013 that has also begun to influence some countries and energy companies already.\nIn response to Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" slogan aimed at ramping up fossil fuel extraction, and the US notifying the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Indonesia, for instance, has hinted that it may follow suit.\n\"If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?\" asked Hashim Djojohadikusumo, special envoy for climate change and energy of Indonesia, as reported by the country's government-run news agency Antara. \nIndonesia has remained in the list of top 10 carbon-emitting countries for years now.\n\"Indonesia produces three tons of carbon [per person a year] while the US produces 13 tons,\" he asked at the ESG Sustainable Forum 2025 in Jakarta on 31 January.\n\"Yet we are the ones being told to close our power plants... So, where is the sense of justice here?\" \nNithi Nesadurai, director with Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the signals from her region were concerning.\nShe said the \"richest country and the largest oil producer in the world\" increasing its production gives other states \"an easy excuse to increase their own - which they are already doing\".\nIn South Africa, Africa's biggest economy and a major carbon emitter, a $8.5bn foreign-aided transition project from the coal sector was already moving at a snail's pace, and now there are fears that it may get derailed further.\nWikus Kruger, director of Power Futures Lab at the University of Cape Town, said there was a \"possibility\" that decommissioning of old coal-fired power stations would be \"further delayed\".\nHowever he said that while there was some \"walk back\" from transition to renewables, there was still growth in the clean energy sector that was expected to continue.\nArgentina withdrew its negotiators from the COP29 climate meeting in Baku last November, days after Trump won the US presidency. It has since followed Trump's lead in signalling it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement of 2015 - which underpins global efforts to combat climate change.\n\"We now expect our oil and gas production to go up,\"  Enrique Viale, president of the Argentine Association of Environmental Lawyers, told the BBC.\n\"President Milei has hinted that he intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and has said environmentalism is part of the woke agenda.\"\nMeanwhile, energy giant Equinor has just announced it is halving investment in renewable energy over the next two years while increasing oil and gas production,  and another oil major, BP, is expected to make a similar announcement soon.\nTrump has not just said \"drill, baby, drill\" but also: \"We will export American energy all over the world.\"\nPotential foreign buyers are already lining up.\nIndia and the US have agreed to significantly increase the supply of American oil and gas to the Indian market.\nAt the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit on 14 February, the two countries issued a joint statement that \"reaffirmed\" the US would be \"a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India\".\nA few days after Trump's inauguration, South Korea, the world's third largest liquified natural gas importer, has hinted its intention to buy more American oil and gas aimed at reducing a trade surplus with the US and improving energy security, international media have reported from Seoul.\nOfficials with Japan's largest power generator, JERA, have told Reuters they too want to increase purchases of liquified natural gas from the US to diversify supply, as it currently imports half of it from the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"There is certainly a threat that if the US seeks to either flood markets with cheap fossil fuels, or bully countries into buying more of its fossil fuels, or both, the global energy transition might be slowed,\" said Lorne Stockman, research director with Oil Change International, a research and advocacy organisation for transition to clean energy.\nScientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.\n\"The economics of energy supply are a key driver of decarbonisation,\" said David Brown, director of energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy think-tank.\n\"The resource base of US energy supports the role of natural gas and liquids production. By contrast, import-dependent economies such as China, India, and those in Southeast Asia have a dramatic economic incentive to decarbonise sources of energy.\"\nGlobal energy transition investment surpassed $2tn for the first time last year but studies have also shown that the growth of clean energy transition has markedly slowed in recent years, while many major banks continue to finance fossil fuels.",

        "article_text": "With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms.\nAll the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.\nThe bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; \u00a34m) for those found to have killed one.\nGoing back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.\nIt was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died.\n\"Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,\" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC.\nBut for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them.\n\"I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,\" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC.\nAnother farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard.\n\"We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,\" she told the BBC.\nAlso known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nThey are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather.\nStanding at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates.\nBut with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home.\n\"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.\nIn the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.\nThis decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.\n\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,\" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC.\nAround Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn. \nConservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara.\nDozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda.\n\"One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,\" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC.\nMr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes.\nFarmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides.\n\"I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible.\n\"It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,\" he told the BBC.\nSarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles.\nCranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment.\n\"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,\" Ms Kugonza told BBC.\nTheir exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.\nBut crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.\n\"It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,\" said Mr Muheebwa.\nThey attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it.\nScientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days.\nAny destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns.\nTheir monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck.\n\"Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,\" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said.\nThis is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes.\nAnd in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands.\nPresident Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation.\nThe ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected.\nNature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained \"very low\".\nFor Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law.\n\"We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes,\" he said.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

With his bid, Musk was floating a price, according to Cornell University senior lecturer Lutz Finger, who is also the founder and CEO of AI startup R2Decide.\n\"By Musk putting a price tag on the non-profit part, he makes the split way more expensive for Altman to do,\" Mr Finger told the BBC. \"It's very simple.\"\nMr Musk justified his actions by saying he wants to return OpenAI - which he co-founded - to its non-profit roots and original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity.\nOthers, though, suggest he has somewhat less noble motives linked to his own AI company xAI and chatbot Grok, which have received a lacklustre response from the public.\n\"Musk has missed the AI train, somewhat. He's behind, and he has made several attempts to catch up,\" Mr Finger said.\nNow, Mr Finger says, Mr Musk is trying to kneecap his most formidable competitor.\nAn already-tense relationship appeared to worsen further last week with Mr Altman taunting Mr Musk's offer on X, and Mr Musk retorting by calling his onetime partner a \"swindler\".\nMr Altman then hit back in an interview with Bloomberg, opining that Mr Musk is not \"a happy person\" and saying his decisions are made from a \"position of insecurity\".\nThe tit-for-tat is also playing out in court, where US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is considering Mr Musk's request for an injunction that would block OpenAI from its planned conversion.\nHe claims that he will be irreparably harmed without her intervention.\n\"It is plausible that what Mr Musk is saying is true.

This did not work and it was Merino's arrival and accomplished finishing with both goals in the 2-0 win, that has given Arteta very palatable food for thought and kept the Gunners firmly in the title hunt.\nWilliam Saliba offered himself up as a potential striker solution after Kai Havertz suffered a season-ending hamstring injury on Arsenal's sunshine break to Dubai, but this was not an option given his high-class quality in defence.\nArteta suggested another defender, Riccardo Calafiori, might be in the frame and the Italian has shown an eye for a goal - but Merino has made his case in Arsenal's state of emergency, scoring twice in a game for the first time since 2016.\nIt was a tactical switch that had a touch of desperation as well as improvisation, but Arteta and Merino must take the credit as Arsenal extended their unbeaten run to 15 games in the Premier League - 10 wins and five draws. It is their best run since going 16 games unbeaten between December 2010 and April 2011 under Arsene Wenger.\nA delighted Arteta said: \"Mikel has a sense of danger and great timing in the box. We were composed, scored two brilliant goals and could have scored one or two more.\"\nHe added: \"He has got a goal threat. He can smell danger. He can anticipate the action. He's got really good timing to arrive in certain areas and execute.\n\"We are going to have various contexts and we are prepared. We have to have the pictures in our heads for these scenarios. We have to see where the game is and what is demanded. In this game we believed it was him. The hardest thing then is to deliver and he did.\n\"I think the game started to suit him more because Leicester started to defend much deeper. We had more momentum, more sequences, more set-pieces as well in that period. And we believed that he could impact the game. We were lucky that he did it.\"\nMerino's late double keeps Arsenal title pursuit on track at Leicester\nSaturday's Premier League action and reaction\nThis video can not be played\nWithout a doubt Arsenal's bright spark - Shearer on Nwaneri\nThe 6ft 2in Merino's height and stature make him an obvious threat and so it proved. He stole in to head home powerfully from Ethan Nwaneri's right-wing cross with nine minutes left, before finishing with confidence after 87 minutes to wrap up the win that leaves Arsenal four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool having played a game more.\nThe player himself played down the notion he might figure more as a striker, but on this evidence Arteta may give him no say in the matter as he makes his plans without Havertz and Gabriel Jesus until next season.\nMerino said when asked about starting as a striker: \"I don't think so to be honest. It is certainly the first time I have scored two coming off the bench as a striker.\"\nHe told BBC Match Of The Day: \"It was big news for me this morning when one of the assistants told me this was an option. It's the first time in my career that I've played in this position, but the good thing is that the way this team plays, everyone knows what to do.\n\"Mikel told me to use my strengths in the box and I was in the right place at the right time. I've not trained there once but I know what everyone has to do on the pitch. Tactically, we are a rich team and I just tried to emulate all the guys who are out injured.\"\nIf Merino, justifiably, grabbed the headlines, it was 17-year-old Nwaneri who was Arsenal's overall inspiration with a superb performance of skill, confidence, pace and maturity.\nNwaneri delivered the inviting cross for Merino's opener, having previously hit the woodwork twice in Arsenal's only serious moments of threat before those late goals.\nArteta was lavish in his praise of Nwaneri, as well as his fellow teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, who ensured Arsenal stayed on level terms by applying a vital touch to Jordan Ayew's cross with Bobby de Cordova-Reid waiting to tap in a simple finish at the far post with the scoreline goalless.\nHe said: \"Physically they are built in a really special way already. Emotionally and mentally, how composed they are, and how they make decisions on the pitch are really impressive, so let them go.\"\nArsenal's nerves and anxiety were mounting until Merino stepped into the breach, the lack of a serious central threat obvious as every attempt floundered near goal with Leicester City holding firm.\nIn among that pre-Merino mediocrity, it was a dismal day for Sterling, who struggled to do a thing right and looked short of confidence and the old pace before Arteta decided he had seen enough.\nSterling looked crestfallen as he walked off, another opportunity missed for the 30-year-old former England forward to show he can still be a going concern at this level as he continues to struggle at Arsenal after being marginalised by Chelsea.\nNo such problems for Merino, who has not had a full effect in midfield since his Arsenal arrival but may now have the chance to do so further forward as Arteta looks to solve his most pressing problem.\nAnd there was a touch of belated romance about Merino's heroics and Arsenal's win as the Spain midfielder said: \"I forgot to give my wife something for Valentine's Day so this goes to her.

Her actions afterwards were even more important to women's football and the fight against racism.\nShaw netted twice in the first half as City beat Liverpool 4-0 to end a run of successive home defeats in the Women's Super League and keep in touch with the top three and Champions League qualification.\nIt was the Jamaican's first start since suffering a leg injury on 8 December, and during her return to fitness, City had lost three league games and fallen out of WSL title contention.\nShaw's goals, both excellently taken finishes which showed off a mix of power and finesse of which she is uniquely capable in the WSL, demonstrated just how much her side have missed her.\nBut what truly caught the eye was her celebration after the opener. She stood with her right fist raised and her head bowed - the Black Power salute.\nShaw double as Man City hit four past Liverpool\nShaw misses League Cup semi-final after abuse\nThis is an anti-racism gesture and most famous in sporting contexts for being enacted originally by American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics in protest against discrimination in their home country.\nShaw has been the victim of racist abuse recently, following City's last home league game \u2013 a 4-3 league defeat to Arsenal on 2 February.\nSo bad was the online abuse that she made herself unavailable to face the Gunners a few days later when they met again in the League Cup semi-finals, before returning and scoring off the bench in the Women's FA Cup win over Leicester.\nAnd this was another notable moment for Shaw, given an immense cheer by the home fans when her name was announced before kick-off and then a standing ovation when she was subbed on the hour mark with the game won.\nThis video can not be played\nWSL highlights: Man City 4-0 Liverpool\nShaw declined to address the celebration directly when speaking to Sky Sports after the game, simply saying it was \"good to get back on the scoresheet after a difficult couple of days\".\nWhile admitting he had not seen the celebration himself, City manager Gareth Taylor said it carried an important meaning.\n\"It's powerful,\" he added. \"She's a proud black woman and, where she is from, means a lot to her. We will always support her, and the reaction of the crowd meant a lot to her.\"\nShaw has attempted to lift herself above her detractors by not sharing any of the abuse she received so as not to give the abusers publicity. But the fact she felt unable to face Arsenal in a crucial League Cup tie showed the effect it had on the 28-year-old.\nAgainst Liverpool, Shaw felt ready to do her talking on the pitch \u2013 and did so in style.\n\"The way I saw it was a brilliant level of self-awareness by Shaw to take herself out of the equation [by not playing against Arsenal],\" former Manchester City defender Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports. \"If you're not in your performance space you might do something stupid.\n\"We don't know how Bunny feels, but we have to respect it and she proved her point tonight.\"\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page\nKhadija Shaw scored for the first time in the WSL in 2025 with two first-half goals against Liverpool\nShaw is one of the most high profile black female footballers in the world, and in the WSL there is no active striker who can touch her.\nShe has scored 11 league goals this season, three more than second-highest scorer Alessia Russo, despite playing two matches fewer.\nCity's player of the year in each of the last two seasons, Shaw has scored 88 goals in just 102 appearances for the club.\nShe is loved and respected at City, with the stadium announcer emphasising she was \"our number 21\" following both goals for the fourth-placed side.\n\"It was incredible,\" team-mate Lauren Hemp told Sky Sports. \"Bunny has been through a lot recently so it's great for her and it's great for us to see her back scoring goals like she always has done.\"\nIt is in games like this one against Liverpool where her quality shines brightest.

It's a difficult one.\"\nSinner was cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent panel after testing positive for the banned substance clostebol in March.\nWada had been seeking a ban of up to two years, having launched an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) following the 2024 decision by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) not to suspend Sinner.\nHowever, it reached a deal after accepting the player was inadvertently contaminated by a banned substance and \"did not intend to cheat\".\nWorld number 766 Broady said he was a \"little bit upset at the verdict\", adding that \"it doesn't seem like there's much being lost from this ban\".\n\"It does appear to be favouritism towards the better players on the tour,\" Broady added.\n\"I wouldn't say that he's done it on purpose, but if that had happened to another player, would we be treated the same way? Would we be afforded the same sort of dignity?\"\nJannik Sinner has been world number one since June 2024\nBroady is the latest player to question Sinner's ability to navigate the system by employing a high-powered legal team.\n\"This is how the system is supposed to work, but obviously he has a multi-million pound lawyer team to exploit that and to make the system work correctly, whereas the rest of us don't,\" Broady said.\n\"In tennis, we're all sort of self-employed and a lot of us don't make millions of pounds a year to be able to fight this sort of stuff. \n\"I would like to see, I don't know if it's even possible, the ATP to provide legal teams for everybody, good legal teams, that everybody has to use, be that Jannik, be that Tara Moore when she was banned or Mikael Ymer when he got banned.\n\"Everybody has the same legal team - money shouldn't come into it.\"\nBritain's Moore was suspended under anti-doping rules in June 2022 but had that ban overturned in December 2023.\nSweden's Ymer was banned for 18 months because of an anti-doping rule violation.\n\"I don't like how the finances have maybe affected the outcome of this compared to other cases,\" Broady added.\nDaniil Medvedev, who won the US Open in 2021, said it's a \"bad sign\" if other players are not afforded the chance to have strong legal representation.\nThe Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) has launched a new scheme to help players facing allegations of doping or corruption to access pro bono legal support in an attempt to ensure access to \"world-class legal expertise regardless of a player's financial standing and personal resources\".\nNovak Djokovic believes now is the time to make changes to an \"unfair\" anti-doping system.\n\"A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers,\" Djokovic said at the Qatar Open in Doha.\n\"Right now it's a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn't work [for] anti-doping, it's obvious.\n\"The problem is that right now there is a lack of trust generally from the tennis players, both male and female, towards Wada and ITIA, and the whole process.\n\"I hope that in the next period of the near future that the governing bodies are going to come together, of our tours and the tennis ecosystem, and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes.\n\"It's inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair.\"\nLive scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "\"When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste',\" says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. \"It makes me so proud,\" she says.\nRakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired.\n\"Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me,\" she says.\nWhen Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete.\n\"I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'\" she recalls.\nHer teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to.\nFor a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her.\nA middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury.\nThere was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners.\nHowever, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. \"I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country,\" he says.\nHe invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities.\nWhen they are running \"it's the small things that matter\", says Rahul. \"When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort.\"\nCompetition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete.\nOver time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now \"I believe in my guide runner more than myself\", says Rakshitha.\nThey won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags.\nRakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024.\nThey missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze.\nSimran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone.\nBut in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running.\nBut the search proved challenging. \"It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do,\" she explains.\nSimran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events.\n\"They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy',\" he says. \"But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult.\" Every movement has to be synchronised.\nSimran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met.\nTheir first race, the 100m, ended in disaster.\n\"Neither of us knew the rules properly,\" says Simran. Abhay \"thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely\". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her.\nBut by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category.\nRiding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal.\nBut Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too.\nAlthough guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path.\n\"All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities,\" says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name.\nBoth Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with.\nDespite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. \"I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal,\" she says, hoping that next time she will win gold.\nRakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. \"She must win a medal,\" he says. \"There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them.\"\nThe BBC Indian Sportswoman Of The Year (ISWOTY) Award is back with its fifth edition to celebrate and honour the remarkable achievements of women athletes in India. Find out about the nominees - the winner will be announced on 17 February.",

        "article_text": "Zeeshan Ali has been a drag artist for 10 years and has taken his show all over India.\nCentral to his performance is a collection of around 45 wigs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an alter of identity, helping me transition from my everyday self into exaggerated, glamorous or whimsical characters. The right wig makes me feel more authentic and empowers me to command the stage,\" says Ali, who is based in Mumbai.\nBut getting that look right wasn't easy in the early days.\n\"When I started my career the accessibility of the wigs was extremely difficult in India. Most of them were to be sourced from abroad or I used to make wigs sourced from whatever was available to me like wool, fabric,\" he says.\nBut things are different now.\n\u201cThe trend is changing. Wigs are no longer just meant for drag or movie artists, but many straight women wear wigs to look different. It's no longer just a hair accessory but a style statement.\u201d\nIndian hair has always been in demand for wig-making. The nation is the world's biggest exporter of human hair, supplying 85% of global demand. \nKolachi Venkatesh, based in Avadi, Chennai, has been collecting hair for 20 years. He started at the bottom of the industry as a picker - collecting hair from households and rescuing it from the rubbish. \n\u201cMy parents were hair pickers and then I started doing the same,\" he says.\nHair collected by pickers from homes, salons and barbershops is called non-Remy hair. \nIt requires more processing than Remy hair, which is carefully shaved straight from the scalp. Nevertheless, it has value.\n\"It\u2019s just thrown away but it's gold,\" says Mr Venkatesh.\nThose pickers typically sell hair to local traders like Mr Venkatesh for between 10 cents and $1 (\u00a30.80) per kilogram, depending on the quality and length of the hair.\nShorter or damaged hair fetches less, while longer strands bring higher prices.\nFor the individual picker, there's not much money in it.\n\u201cA diligent collector might gather 1\u20135 kilograms of hair in a day, earning anywhere from 59 cents to $6 per day. This income level is often below minimum wage standards, particularly in rural areas,\u201d says Mr Venkatesh, who has 50 pickers working for him.\n\u201cWhile our work contributes to a billion-dollar global market our earnings remain meagre. Intermediaries control prices.\u201d \nMost of the Indian hair collected by traders like Mr Venkatesh is exported to China where it is made into wigs.\n\u201cChina has a huge wigmaking industry which is worth five to six billion dollars,\" says Benjamin Cherian from Plexconcil, the hair industry body that promotes the Indian industry and liaises with the government. \nIf India wants a slice of the lucrative wig market, he says, then it has a lot of catching up to do.\n\"When we look at China there are hundreds of factories spread across the country which add value to the hair industry, whereas in India the value addition still needs to be picked up,\u201d Mr Cherian says.\nHe says the government needs to help promote investment in the hair industry.\n\"It needs automated sorting systems, sophisticated hair treatment procedures for the hair collected, innovative production techniques for manufacturing of wigs which will make India stand out.\u201d\nInstead of exporting hair for hundreds of dollars, India should be selling wigs worth thousands of dollars says Mr Cherian.\n\u201cWe have started working on it but it\u2019s a long way to go. We need to have research and training centres,\" he says.\nOne Indian business trying to make inroads is Delhi-based Diva Divine Hair, co-founded by Krishan Jalani in 2019.\nIt is currently managed by chief executive and co-founder Nidhi Tiwari.\nThe idea was to create high-quality hair extensions and wigs that would appeal to a broader range of customers.\n\"There is a growing need for these solutions due to rising issues of hair loss and thinning among women in India,\" says Ms Tiwari.\nThe company has been helped by a shift in attitude. \n\"Once considered a niche or taboo topic, wigs and extensions are now openly discussed, thanks to evolving social norms and a shift toward acceptance,\" she says.\nWigs have also seen a lot of development making them more attractive and comfortable.\n\"Technologies such as 3D-printed wigs and digital colour-matching tools offer highly personalised options. Lightweight, breathable wig caps and improved adhesives have given customers to wear it for long time without discomfort,\" says Ms Tiwari.\nAt the top end of the hair market is Temple or Remy hair.\nMuch of the supply comes from Hindu temples in the south of the country where hair is shaved off in an act of veneration and faith.\nRaj Hair International is one of the biggest traders in the Temple hair business. \nCraftsmen at the company's Chennai factory sort and grade the hair according to colour, texture and length.\n\"Remy hair has aligned cuticles, hair flows uniformly in one direction, which leads to less tangling and a silkier texture. This is high-value hair,\" says George Cherion, the company's chief executive.\nThe firm tries to waste as little of the hair as possible. To help with that it developed a machine to untangle the hair. It's allowed them to work faster with fewer staff. \n\"Our mission is to constantly upgrade the technology,\" says Mr Cherion.\nBusiness is booming. \n\"Indian human is in demand globally due to its high quality, natural look, and thinness. The demand is skyrocketing,\" he says. \nBack in Mumbai Zeeshan Ali wants to see more Indian wigs on the market.\nAs well as making them more affordable, he has a design suggestion: \"A wig that can create a wow factor.\"",

        "article_text": "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.\nBut, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.\nThis is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".\n\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.\nAfter a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.\nHer audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. \nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.\nShe rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \n\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.\nIt affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.\nOther audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.\nFive NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.\nAPD is more common in neurodivergent people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.\nHer team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"\nNoise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.\nLisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \n\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.\n\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.\n\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.\nFor those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.\nA UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.\nAnd, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.\nProf Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"\nParticularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown. \nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.\nDr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \n\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"\nDr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. \nHe said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.\nSo-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.\nMicrophones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.\n\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.\n\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"\nTo improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\nWayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.\nHowever, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky. \n\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"\nSophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future. \n\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

        "article_text": "Robert Pattinson stars as multiple clones in the South Korean film-maker's big-budget follow up to Parasite \u2013 and while the star himself is entertaining, the film as a whole is a mess.\nNo best picture winner at the Oscars has been as exciting in recent years as Bong Joon Ho's Parasite \u2013 and not just because it was the first ever victor not in the English language. A scabrous takedown of the complacency of the rich, it was subversive in the way few awards players truly are, while its celebration within the gilded denizens of Hollywood added an extra layer of irony. \nFor fans of the South Korean film-maker, the good news is that despite his added commercial stock, his long-awaited follow-up is no less mischievous: a large-scale sci-fi filled with Hollywood stars and big themes it may be, but it mostly eschews the grandiose self-importance typical of such an endeavour. The bad news \u2013 and possibly an explanation for its delays in release \u2013 is that it doesn't really know what approach it wants to take instead.\u00a0All in all, it must be considered a serious disappointment from the director.\nAt least Robert Pattinson fans will be happy to get multiple (well, mostly two) versions of the actor for the price of one. He plays Mickey Barnes, a down-on-his-luck guy in a dystopian near-future, where floods of citizens are desperate to leave Earth, who signs up to a space colony program as an \"expendable\" \u2013 that is, a guinea pig worker who can be deployed in various perilous experiments for the benefit of humanity, only to be \"reprinted\" every time he inevitably dies, as a new cloned version of himself. Which is all well and good, until version number 17 of him unexpectedly survives after falling down an ice shaft on the planet Niflheim \u2013 and finds Mickey number 18 already installed in his living quarters. The question is: how do two versions of the same person learn to get along \u2013 or not?\nThe \"reprinting\" or human cloning premise is certainly one that should have plenty of narrative potential. It could be a rich source of philosophical inquiry, given what it raises about the nature of the self, death, and more besides. It could also, of course, be the basis for some decent satire, casting as it does its \"expendables\" scheme as the logical endpoint for a society that desires to exploit people without consequences. Yet on the former front, the film seems peculiarly uninterested in dealing with the questions it throws up, while in the latter respect, the comedy is so broad as to be completely toothless.\nMore like this:\n \u202210 of the best films to watch this February \n \u2022 Six ways the Berlin Film Festival will make waves\n \u2022 Why 'category fraud' is causing Oscars anger\nThe colony is run by Mark Ruffalo as a veneer-toothed, bouffant-haired, callous showman \u2013 and it's a groaningly obvious performance, from start to finish; just as tiresome is Toni Collette as his equally despotic wife, flashing a Cheshire Cat-sized grin of insincerity throughout. The brilliance of Parasite lay in how it took apart the superficial \"niceness\" of its privileged characters: here, however, they are so obviously and uninterestingly awful \u2013 characterisations worthy of a bad Saturday Night Live skit \u2013 that the effect is to defang the story of any genuine bite. That might be forgivable if the film was at least funny \u2013 but again and again lines and scenes strain for comic effect, but fail to deliver the goods.\nMickey 17\nDirector: Bong Joon Ho\nCast: Robert Pattinson, Naomi Ackie, Mark Ruffalo, Toni Collette\nRun-time: 2hr 17m\nSome of the actors fare better with the material: as Mickey's lover Nasha, Naomi Ackie is enjoyably sweary and makes the most of a rousing anti-authoritarian speech, while Pattinson has fun with the antagonism between Mickey 17, a nebbish type with a touch of Steve Buscemi, and the surly, more rebellious Mickey 18. But then that, too, becomes sidelined as the pair put their animosity aside and join forces for an epic action climax, involving them meeting the planet's native cockroach race the Creepers \u2013 think Dune's gapingly-mouthed Sandworms with legs. Suddenly, Bong does indeed go for a conventional blockbuster earnestness he has hitherto rejected \u2013 and fails to make that fit too;\u00a0like its hero, this is a film with a major identity crisis. \nWith a reported budget of $150m, it would certainly be a surprise if this curio can find the kind of audience it needs to succeed. In these risk-averse times, it's good to see an expensive studio film that is at least deeply idiosyncratic \u2013 but you have to hope such a folly doesn't make the money men even more cautious in future. \n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday. \nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

That might be forgivable if the film was at least funny \u2013 but again and again lines and scenes strain for comic effect, but fail to deliver the goods.Mickey 17Director: Bong Joon HoCast: Robert Pattinson, Naomi Ackie, Mark Ruffalo, Toni ColletteRun-time: 2hr 17mSome of the actors fare better with the material: as Mickey's lover Nasha, Naomi Ackie is enjoyably sweary and makes the most of a rousing anti-authoritarian speech, while Pattinson has fun with the antagonism between Mickey 17, a nebbish type with a touch of Steve Buscemi, and the surly, more rebellious Mickey 18. For fans of the South Korean film-maker, the good news is that despite his added commercial stock, his long-awaited follow-up is no less mischievous: a large-scale sci-fi filled with Hollywood stars and big themes it may be, but it mostly eschews the grandiose self-importance typical of such an endeavour. Which is all well and good, until version number 17 of him unexpectedly survives after falling down an ice shaft on the planet Niflheim \u2013 and finds Mickey number 18 already installed in his living quarters.",

        "article_text": "The UN climate summit in the United Arab Emirates in 2023 ended with a call to \"transition away from fossil fuels\". It was applauded as a historic milestone in global climate action.\nBarely a year later, however, there are fears that the global commitment may be losing momentum, as the growth of clean energy transition is slowing down while burning of fossil fuels continues to rise.\nAnd now there is US President Donald Trump's \"national energy emergency\", embracing fossil fuels and ditching clean energy policies  \u2013 that has also begun to influence some countries and energy companies already.\nIn response to Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" slogan aimed at ramping up fossil fuel extraction, and the US notifying the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Indonesia, for instance, has hinted that it may follow suit.\n\"If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?\" asked Hashim Djojohadikusumo, special envoy for climate change and energy of Indonesia, as reported by the country's government-run news agency Antara. \nIndonesia has remained in the list of top 10 carbon-emitting countries for years now.\n\"Indonesia produces three tons of carbon [per person a year] while the US produces 13 tons,\" he asked at the ESG Sustainable Forum 2025 in Jakarta on 31 January.\n\"Yet we are the ones being told to close our power plants... So, where is the sense of justice here?\" \nNithi Nesadurai, director with Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the signals from her region were concerning.\nShe said the \"richest country and the largest oil producer in the world\" increasing its production gives other states \"an easy excuse to increase their own - which they are already doing\".\nIn South Africa, Africa's biggest economy and a major carbon emitter, a $8.5bn foreign-aided transition project from the coal sector was already moving at a snail's pace, and now there are fears that it may get derailed further.\nWikus Kruger, director of Power Futures Lab at the University of Cape Town, said there was a \"possibility\" that decommissioning of old coal-fired power stations would be \"further delayed\".\nHowever he said that while there was some \"walk back\" from transition to renewables, there was still growth in the clean energy sector that was expected to continue.\nArgentina withdrew its negotiators from the COP29 climate meeting in Baku last November, days after Trump won the US presidency. It has since followed Trump's lead in signalling it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement of 2015 - which underpins global efforts to combat climate change.\n\"We now expect our oil and gas production to go up,\"  Enrique Viale, president of the Argentine Association of Environmental Lawyers, told the BBC.\n\"President Milei has hinted that he intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and has said environmentalism is part of the woke agenda.\"\nMeanwhile, energy giant Equinor has just announced it is halving investment in renewable energy over the next two years while increasing oil and gas production,  and another oil major, BP, is expected to make a similar announcement soon.\nTrump has not just said \"drill, baby, drill\" but also: \"We will export American energy all over the world.\"\nPotential foreign buyers are already lining up.\nIndia and the US have agreed to significantly increase the supply of American oil and gas to the Indian market.\nAt the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit on 14 February, the two countries issued a joint statement that \"reaffirmed\" the US would be \"a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India\".\nA few days after Trump's inauguration, South Korea, the world's third largest liquified natural gas importer, has hinted its intention to buy more American oil and gas aimed at reducing a trade surplus with the US and improving energy security, international media have reported from Seoul.\nOfficials with Japan's largest power generator, JERA, have told Reuters they too want to increase purchases of liquified natural gas from the US to diversify supply, as it currently imports half of it from the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"There is certainly a threat that if the US seeks to either flood markets with cheap fossil fuels, or bully countries into buying more of its fossil fuels, or both, the global energy transition might be slowed,\" said Lorne Stockman, research director with Oil Change International, a research and advocacy organisation for transition to clean energy.\nScientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.\n\"The economics of energy supply are a key driver of decarbonisation,\" said David Brown, director of energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy think-tank.\n\"The resource base of US energy supports the role of natural gas and liquids production. By contrast, import-dependent economies such as China, India, and those in Southeast Asia have a dramatic economic incentive to decarbonise sources of energy.\"\nGlobal energy transition investment surpassed $2tn for the first time last year but studies have also shown that the growth of clean energy transition has markedly slowed in recent years, while many major banks continue to finance fossil fuels.",

He is also due to meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in coming days for talks on the war in Ukraine - a meeting that neither Ukraine nor other European countries have been invited to.\nHis visit comes after a shipment of American-made heavy bombs arrived in Israel overnight.\nIsrael's Defence Minister Israel Katz said his country had received a delivery of MK-84 bombs from the US late on Saturday, after Trump overturned a block on exporting the munitions placed by his predecessor, Joe Biden.\nBiden initially shipped thousands of MK-84s to Israel after Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, but later declined to clear the bombs for export out of concern for their impact on Gaza. The powerful 2,000-pound bombs have a wide blast radius and can rip through concrete and metal, destroying entire buildings.\nKatz said the shipment represented a \"significant asset\" for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and served as evidence of the \"strong alliance between Israel and the United States\".\nMeanwhile, Hamas said an Israeli air strike had killed three police officers near Rafah in southern Gaza on Sunday, which it called a \"serious violation\" of the ceasefire.\nIsrael said it had struck \"several armed individuals\" in southern Gaza.\nThe ceasefire came into force on 19 January and requires a complete pause in fighting for the first 42-day phase. \nFears had been high this week that the fragile ceasefire agreement could collapse after a dispute over a planned hostage release, which was nearly aborted but ultimately went ahead on Saturday.\nNetanyahu's office confirmed on Sunday that an Israeli negotiating team would travel to Cairo on Monday to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire.",

We have to score goals. This is the idea.\"\nGuardiola is determined City will not leave the Bernabeu wondering or with regrets, saying: \"We must play with courage. We must be ourselves. It will need incredible courage and we must play to win.\n\"We could still lose, but we have to show that courage and be ourselves. We have to play so well, especially after the result we took away in the first leg.\"\nOpta statistics rate City's chances of advancing at a more optimistic 19.8%, but those percentages must be viewed through the prism of Real's history in this tournament and the muscle memory that kicks in for the 15-time winners when it matters.\nGuardiola's record with City against Real is chequered, though it started with victory in the last 16 in 2020, the two legs being played six months apart because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe most bitter moment came two years later when City led by two goals on aggregate in the 90th minute of the semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu, only for Rodrygo to score twice within seconds, Karim Benzema's injury-time penalty sending Real on to eventual victory over Liverpool in the final in Paris.\nWhen Guardiola, as Manchester City manager, claimed his third Champions League crown in 2023, after winning with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Real were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the Spanish champions then prevailing on penalties last season.\nHe said: \"I have some incredible memories here - sometimes good ones, sometimes not so good. \n\"We know at this stage, and in this stadium, the pressure is there - but you get that in Milan, in Barcelona, at Anfield. You have to suffer at these places, but you have to reduce those moments.\"\nReal's remarkable win against City in 2022 is the sort of sporting lightning strike Guardiola will seek to turn back on them, but he must do it with a fading team that has lost its domestic supremacy after winning a historic four successive Premier Leagues, and now faces the prospect of going out of the Champions League before the last 16 for the first time in 12 years.\nCarlo Ancelotti (left) and Pep Guardiola will be meeting in the Champions League for the 10th time\nThe wily Ancelotti was not taking Guardiola's bait about percentages when he spoke in Madrid on Tuesday, saying: \"He doesn't really think that. We don't think we have a 99% chance. We have a small advantage - and we have to take advantage of that.\"\nGuardiola responded: \"For the first time he didn't believe me. I always say what I think, and this time you don't believe me.\"\nStatistics pile up like giant obstacles in front of City's route to the last 16, explaining why Real are overwhelming favourites after two goals in a late surge gave them victory at Etihad Stadium.\nIt was the 40th time Real have won the first leg of a European knockout-stage tie away from home, progressing on 37 of the previous 39 occasions.\nCity's defeat, meanwhile, was the fifth time they have lost the first leg of a Champions League knockout-stage tie, going on to be eliminated on the previous four occasions.\nFor Ancelotti, this tournament's greatest coach with five wins, he will be meeting Guardiola in the Champions League for the 10th time, on eight occasions with Real against City. The Italian has won four of their nine meetings, never losing at home, winning two games and drawing two.\nOf more recent significance is that to unseat the holders, City will have to alter poor form in the competition after losing their past three away games to Sporting, Juventus and Paris St-Germain.\nGuardiola's spirits will be lifted by Saturday's 4-0 win over Newcastle United which included a hat-trick inside 14 first-half minutes for new Egyptian signing Omar Marmoush, while Erling Haaland demonstrated his quality with both goals in the first-leg defeat, his first against Real Madrid.\nHaaland has been prolific in the Champions League, scoring 49 goals in 48 games. If he scores at the Bernabeu, he will become the fastest player to 50 goals in appearances and age, at 24 years and 213 days.\nIt could even be a Champions League farewell to Manchester City for modern greats of the club such as Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and goalkeeper Ederson, while others such as Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic are also in their 30s.\nGuardiola would not be drawn as he said: \"I would like to answer this but it will be at the end of the season. We still have a lot to play for, to qualify for the Champions League next season, we are still there in the Champions League this season. We have the FA Cup and the Club World Cup.\"\nSilva added: \"If you had told me at the start of the season that we would be in this position in the Champions League and the Premier League I wouldn't have believed you. We deserve to be in this complicated situation because of where we finished.\n\"We have to believe. We still believe things can go our way, but this season is certainly a lesson for the future.\"\nFor Manchester City, that future is now - in the forbidding, unforgiving surroundings of the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nAnd if Guardiola can overcome those \"1%\" odds in this footballing cathedral, it will rank alongside the best results of his career.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

Fairness in tennis does not exist.\"\nBritish player Liam Broady posted: \"Didn't realise you could reach a settlement regarding a doping ban\u2026 Interesting. Back in time for French Open I guess?\"\nFormer French Open doubles champion Feliciano Lopez defended Sinner, responding to Wawrinka on X: \"It's very clear he hasn't done anything to enhance his performance, that's proven. \n\"He's taking full responsibility for the mistakes of others. A longer suspension would have made the sport cleaner? I don't think so.\"\nWorld number one Sinner banned for three months \nWhat happens next for Sinner after doping case?\nAre there different approaches to tennis doping cases? \nThe Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) has criticised the apparent inconsistencies between recent doping cases.\nLast month it launched a new scheme offering players facing allegations of doping or corruption access to pro bono legal support.\nThe scheme was co-founded by former British doubles player Tara Moore, who served a two-year absence because of a doping ban which was later overturned.\nReacting to the news of Sinner's ban, Moore posted on X: \"Can someone explain how a negotiation was possible?\"\nA PTPA statement read: \"The 'system' is not a system. It's a club. Supposed case-by-case discretion is, in fact, merely cover for tailored deals, unfair treatment, and inconsistent rulings.\n\"It's not just the different results for different players. It's the lack of transparency. The lack of process. The lack of consistency...\n\"This bias is unacceptable for all athletes and shows a deep disrespect for every sport and its fans.\"\nFormer Wimbledon champion Simona Halep has previously accused the  International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) of double standards - a claim it has strenuously denied.\nHalep was given a four-year ban for two separate doping offences in 2022 which was later reduced to nine months.\nHalep was critical when it was announced world number two Swiatek would serve a one-month doping ban in November, posting on Instagram at the time: \"I stand and ask myself, why is there such a big difference in treatment and judgment?\n\"I can't find and I don't think there can be a logical answer. It can only be bad will from the ITIA, the organisation that has done absolutely everything to destroy me despite the evidence.\"\nSinner's lawyer Jamie Singer said the Italian's team should bear responsibility for mistakes that led to his failed drugs tests.\nThe ITIA found Sinner was inadvertently contaminated with the banned substance clostebol by his physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi during a massage.\nHe said: \"Wada has confirmed the facts determined by the Independent Tribunal. It is clear that Jannik had no intent, no knowledge, and gained no competitive advantage. Regrettably, errors made by members of his team led to this situation.\"\nWada said it had entered into a settlement agreement with Sinner under provision 10.8.2 in its code.\nA spokesperson said: \"This provision was introduced to the code in 2021. Since then it has been used dozens of times for cases with exceptional circumstances such as this one. \n\"Given there are many thousands of cases, it is not used that often and is the exception rather than the rule but there has been plenty of precedent for this.\n\"Ultimately in this case three months represents a fair outcome under the specific circumstances.\"\nThe ATP, which runs men's tennis, said the case was an \"important reminder of players' responsibility to carefully manage the products and treatments they or their entourages use\".\nItalian Tennis and Padel Federation president Angelo Binaghi said Sinner would be welcomed with open arms at the Italian Open, which begins in Rome three days after his ban ends.\n\"This is the first time that a shameful injustice makes us happy because our first thought is for the boy who sees the end of a nightmare,\" Binaghi said.\nLive scores, results and order of play\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "US black nationalist leader Malcolm X was assassinated on 21 February 1965, at the age of 39. The BBC reported on the reaction in his adopted home of Harlem, New York, as thousands of people queued to pay their last respects.\nAt a time when black civil rights leaders were preaching peaceful integration, Malcolm X's uncompromising vision of black separatism inspired many people, while terrifying others. He was murdered in February 1965, and a reporter for the BBC's Panorama, Michael Charlton, stated at his funeral that he \"spoke a vengeful message, as forthright and chilled as the winter morning they buried him\". Amid tight security, the many thousands of people who had filed past his body were searched by police as a precaution against bombings. \"To these people, he preached that if the white man didn't answer for the black man's frustration, he must answer for his fury,\" added Charlton.\nHe was internationally famous for his incendiary rhetoric, yet he had been developing a new, more moderate worldview. Asked what the death of Malcolm X meant to him by Panorama, one clearly upset man who was in the queue said: \"It's a blow to every black person in the United States of America.\" A young man described him as a hero, saying: \"He stood out among all black people. He showed the white man where it was at.\" This interviewee was one of several people who feared that more violence would follow. \"Whoever did it, Muslims or whoever did it, there's going to be a whole lot of hurt,\" he predicted. One young woman said: \"I don't believe it. Why would they kill another black man?\" Another woman had no doubt who was responsible: \"The white power structure in America is behind it. They quickly capitalised on it by saying that one of his own kind did it, but they put it up to be done. They know they had more to gain by getting Malcolm X out of the way than they had to let him live.\"\nMalcolm X was shot dead on stage at a New York ballroom as he prepared to deliver a speech to his Organization of Afro-American Unity. His wife and children were in the audience. Three men convicted of his murder were all members of the Nation of Islam, the political and religious body that, a year earlier, Malcolm X had left amid acrimony. One of the men was caught while attempting to flee, and confessed to the murder, but the other two convictions resulted in a long-running miscarriage of justice campaign. In 2021, a New York state judge agreed, and their convictions were quashed. Both men were later fully exonerated after New York's attorney general found prosecutors had withheld evidence that, in all likelihood, would have cleared them of blame for the murder.\nStill a controversial figure 60 years after his death, Malcolm\u00a0X remains to some the ultimate symbol of rage and resistance in the face of oppression. Born Malcolm Little in 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska, he was the son of a Baptist preacher. When\u00a0Malcolm\u00a0was six years old, his father was killed in what many believe was a deliberate racist attack by white supremacists, although nobody knows for sure if this was the case. The shock of his father being killed led his mother to have a mental breakdown, and Malcolm and his seven siblings were shipped out to foster homes. He fell into a life of crime, and in 1946 he was jailed for burglary. While in prison, he discovered a love of learning and self-improvement. There, he encountered the ideas of the Nation of Islam, a political and religious body that argued that equality for black Americans could only be achieved through black and white people living in separate states.\u00a0\nUpon his release from prison in 1952, he formally changed his name to Malcolm X. It was a firm rejection of the surname that had been given to his family by the people who, generations earlier, had enslaved them. He toured the US, spreading the Nation of Islam's message, and discovered that he had the power and charisma to inspire people with his words. Public speaking was a skill he had learnt, having entered prison as a middle-school dropout who, he admitted, \"didn't know a verb from a house\". He was not afraid to use shock tactics to get his message across, condemning white people as the \"white devil\" for the historic oppression of black people.\u00a0When US President John F Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, he said it was \"chickens coming home to roost\".\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nWhile Malcolm X attracted many followers, he also made a lot of enemies. In March 1964 he announced that he was leaving the Nation of Islam, having become disillusioned with its leadership. That same month, he witnessed a debate in Washington DC about the Civil Rights Bill, and he finally met Martin Luther King, Jr, a civil rights leader whose belief in nonviolent protest was often seen as being in stark contrast with Malcolm X's more confrontational philosophy.\u00a0\nTo deepen his Muslim faith, he went on the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. He wrote about how he witnessed \"pilgrims of all colours from all parts of this Earth displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood like I've never seen before\". He also toured several countries in Africa, where he made the decision to form a new secular group that sought to reconnect African Americans with their heritage. Upon his return to the US, he renounced the teachings of the Nation of Islam. Around that time, Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz began receiving death threats over the phone, and their home was firebombed.\u00a0\nDespite apparent threats coming from many directions, he continued making his electrifying public appearances. In June 1964, he officially launched his Organization of Afro-American Unity, telling the gathered audience: \"We want freedom by any means necessary. We want justice by any means necessary. We want equality by any means necessary.\" The venue was the Audubon Ballroom in New York's Washington Heights neighbourhood; eight months later he was murdered on that same stage.\nAs mourners continued to file past Malcolm X's body in a Harlem funeral home, Charlton asked several prominent people about what sort of leader he might have become. Malcolm X had become a regular visitor to the United Nations headquarters in New York, according to Daniel Watts, the editor of black nationalist magazine The Liberator. Watts said that he had been highlighting discrimination against black people in the US to members of the Afro-Asian bloc. \"I think for the first time in the history of the struggle here in this country, we had a molecule of hope \u2013 hope in the sense in knowing that we had a heritage, we had roots, we had a motherland to which we could look for,\" he said.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Martin Luther King, Jr, a misunderstood icon of US history\n\u2022\u00a0The day Nelson Mandela walked out of prison a free man\n\u2022\u00a0Nina Simone on how racial injustice fuelled her songs\nJames Farmer, director of the Congress of Racial Equality, told Panorama that while Malcolm X had not been a part of the civil rights movement, his \"more extreme stance\" had boosted its position. He said: \"The public saw very clearly that unless they did what the civil rights movement demanded, they might get Malcolm X. In fact, Malcolm said just that to me once after a debate we had. He said, 'You know you ought to stop pushing us around like this.' I asked why. He said, 'Because we help you. We make a lot of noise, people look at us and scream bloody murder, and then turn to you.'\" Farmer said that Malcolm X had been successful in giving younger black people a sense of identity. \"It has been very important because a person cannot have a sense of destiny for the future unless he believes he is somebody first.\"\nFarmer also said that Malcolm X had been trying to broaden his appeal since his split with the Nation of Islam. \"I feel that his position was in a state of flux, and that he was moving closer toward an integrationist and desegregationist position. He was over at my house just six weeks before he died, and there I asked him if his views had changed on racial issues and he indicated it was true, he was giving up black racism. Now he was prepared, he told me, to accept a man on the basis of his deeds rather than his genes. This was a switch.\"\nPoet Maya Angelou was a friend of Malcolm X who had reconnected with him during his Africa trip when he visited Ghana, where she was living at the time. Speaking in 1992, she told the BBC: \"He came to Ghana and said, 'I have found blue-eyed men who I'm able to call brother, so my prior statement that all whites were devils is erroneous.' It takes an incredible amount of courage to be able to say, 'Say everybody, you remember what I said yesterday? I've found out that's wrong.' And that's what he was able to do. That was amazing.\"\nCharlton concluded his Panorama report on Malcolm X's funeral by observing that he \"died too soon after his adoption of more moderate views for us to know what wider appeal he may have attracted\". He said the \"most arresting epitaph\" he heard that week came from a black person who said, \"I don't know how many followers he had, but he had a hell of a lot of well-wishers.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards that year.\nIn the federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nHe is accused of kidnapping, drugging and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes by using firearms or threatening them with violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, multiple women have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour shortly afterwards, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, and has previously labelled them as \"sickening\" \u2013 suggesting they were \"made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement issued at the start of February - in response to a claim from a lawyer that he would face more than 10 more civil lawsuits - Diddy's own lawyer restated that his client was innocent. \nIn a statement to the BBC in response to the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said:  \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of \"transportation to engage in prostitution\". His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release in the run-up to the trial, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, and describe a culture of widespread violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the request for bail, arguing that Mr Combs was a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses ahead of the sex trafficking trial. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nUS District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled his trial will begin on 5 May.\nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public.\nAll of Mr Combs' court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but not livestreamed.\nMost federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom.\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge. \nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of the sex trafficking charge.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nThe timing is right - Thomas set to retire at the end of the season\nLife as a cyclist is relentless, so after nearly 20 years of looking forward, eyes fixed on the road ahead, Geraint Thomas has not had much time to reflect on the past.\nThings are different now, though. This season will be Thomas' last of a sparkling career that has seen him win two Olympic gold medals, three World Championship titles, numerous road races and the sport's greatest prize of all, the Tour de France.\nA sport this gruelling does not allow its competitors the indulgence of turning an entire season into a glorified lap of honour but, as the end comes into view, Thomas is more contemplative than usual.\n\"Since I was a kid I dreamt of riding the Tour and being part of the Olympics and winning was obviously a dream as well, but to achieve that was just nuts,\" he tells BBC Breakfast.\n\"I think now the decision is official, you do start to reflect because when you're in it, it's just one thing after the next, year after year, so you don't really appreciate it. I guess at the time you enjoy it but I don't think you sit back and reflect and think, so there will be a bit of that this year.\"\nThis has been something of a long goodbye for Thomas, who indicated he would retire at the end of this year when he signed his most recent Ineos Grenadiers contract in 2023.\nFar from winding down, however, the Welshman has been reinvigorated in the twilight of his career, with last year's third place at the Giro d'Italia securing a Grand Tour podium finish for a third successive season.\nGeraint Thomas: A career in pictures\nThomas savours his moment with history in Rome\nThomas signs new contract with Ineos Grenadiers\nThis summer, the 38-year-old will concentrate on the Tour de France, where he will play a supporting role for the team and \"maybe try to win a stage but just enjoy the race\" that he won in 2018.\n\"Beijing was massive, my first Olympics and winning gold there,\" says Thomas. \"But the Tour's what changed my life, being recognised all over the place.\n\"I was in Alcatraz and some dude recognised me. I think that's when you know it went up a level.\n\"The yellow jersey is iconic. You go anywhere in the world and people will know the yellow jersey, how it signifies cycling and its history. So to be a part of that history and to win it, I just pinch myself.\"\nConsidering how competitive Thomas remains at the highest level, you would be forgiven for wondering why he is retiring.\n\"This is my 19th year as a professional and I didn't want to do one year too many and be the grumpy guy in the team,\" he explains.\n\"I'm still really enjoying it, I still feel competitive and the last year has been good, but I think the timing's right. With my family, I'm looking forward to moving back to Cardiff.\n\"There's stuff I think I'll miss, the racing, being here in Monaco, but it will be nice just to be around more and to take on a new challenge.\"\nGeraint Thomas: Over the Finish Line\nCycling superstar Geraint Thomas talks about deciding to retire, his extraordinary achievements, and life in elite sport. \nThomas has not yet decided what that new challenge will be, but he will have plenty of choice.\nThere is a chance he could stay with Ineos Grenadiers in a new capacity, while there will be no shortage of offers to work in the media.\n\"Having options is always good,\" Thomas says. \"I need a purpose. Since I was about 17 or 18, I've always been working towards a goal.\n\"To not be working towards anything would be nice for maybe a month, then I'll just go crazy, so I'll definitely have to have some goals.\n\"I want to do an Ironman. I only run two or three times a year, so that's something that needs a bit of work! It's about challenging myself in different ways.\"\nA future as a triathlete can wait. Once he retires, what Thomas is most looking forward to is spending more time with family and friends, particularly his wife Sara and five-year-old son Macs.\n\"That's the main thing, just being around more and not missing events - birthdays, weddings, parties or whatever,\" he adds. \"I'm looking forward to that side of things.\"\nRetirement is also bound to bring with it myriad offers to appear on reality TV programmes, although Thomas has been warned off Strictly Come Dancing.\n\"I reckon the fitness would be the only thing I've got. I wouldn't back myself. Although my parents-in-law tell me 'please don't do it, you'll make a fool of yourself' and that makes me want to do it,\" he laughs.\n\"That would be the biggest challenge of my life for sure. Maybe I've got the hips for it.\"\nHaving completed the 2013 Tour de France despite breaking his pelvis during the opening stage of the three-week race, Thomas has proved that he is ready to test that particular area of his anatomy.\nIn fact, there are few parts of Thomas' body that have not been bloodied or bruised at some point over the course of his career, and his physical fortitude has earned him the respect of his peers as well as cycling followers around the world.\nOnce he has navigated his final Tour de France and one last summer on the road, Thomas plans to bring the curtain down on his career at the Tour of Britain in September.\nThe route has not yet been finalised but the closing stage could be held in Cardiff, the city where Thomas was born and bred and where he will return to live after retiring.\n\"It would be epic if that happens. I haven't really thought about it much, but when I do start thinking about it, it's going to be emotional. Maybe I'll shed a tear or two,\" Thomas says.\n\"It would be some way to finish, whether it's Cardiff or wherever, the Tour of Britain as the final race. It's full circle, isn't it? Finishing my career back home.\"",

They include figurines, tusks, sculptures of Benin's rulers, and an ivory mask. They were made during between the 15th and 19th Centuries.\nA transfer of agreement is due to be signed on Wednesday.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMan City's Egyptian Prince - Lineker on Marmoush\nThere is not much Erling Haaland has failed to do when it comes to scoring goals since he joined Manchester City.\nFifty-two overall in his first season, including 36 in the Premier League, the most anyone has scored in a single campaign.\nThirty-eight in his second, despite being injured for almost two months, and 27 so far this term.\nThat incredible haul has secured the Norwegian two Golden Boots and an incredible 11 hat-tricks. \nYet none of those trebles came quicker than the 13 minutes and 54 seconds Omar Marmoush took to get his first City hat-trick in the 4-0 win over Newcastle.\nAfter four games without scoring since his \u00a359m winter transfer window move from German side Eintracht Frankfurt, it was an impressive and well-timed surge in form given City go to Real Madrid for their crucial Champions League play-off second leg on Wednesday with a one-goal deficit to overcome after a 3-2 loss at home. \nIt was also the first time any City player other than Haaland had scored three times in a game since Phil Foden did it at Brentford just over a year ago.\nAnd that is the point.\nOne of the notable features of the terrible mid-season run of one win in 13 games, which wrecked any chance City had of extending their record run of four successive titles - and was mainly responsible for them ending up having to face Real Madrid so early in the Champions League - was the fact hardly anyone picked up the slack when Haaland's form dipped.\nJosko Gvardiol, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva all scored two goals in that time. But other than Haaland, who got four, no-one scored more.\nMarmoush hits quickfire treble as Man City thrash Newcastle\nOmar Marmoush had scored 20 goals in all competitions for Eintracht Frankfurt this term, when he joined Manchester City\nIt is that issue Guardiola was trying to address when he called contacts in Germany to check up on Marmoush after sporting director Txiki Begiristain had put the Egyptian's name forward as a part of City's overall \u00a3180m January transfer window spend.\n\"When Txiki came to me I said, because of the season we had, the more players you bring the better,\" said Guardiola.\n\"I called some contacts in Germany because I have friends there. I asked a few things and there was a high opinion in many things; behaviour, in training sessions, goals.\n\"He's young and comes here to make his career. That is why the club decides. They always have the last word.\"\nMarmoush had already demanded attention through the 20 goals he scored for Eintracht in the first half of this season.\nAt 26, City were buying someone approaching the prime of their career.\nOn the evidence of his performance against Newcastle, Marmoush drives forward with purpose when the ball is at his feet, is quick and can find space. \nEvidently he presents a danger opposition defences cannot ignore \u2013 and Newcastle could not contain.\nThat, in turn, may take some of the focus away from Haaland.\n\"Everything about his game was impressive,\" former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day. \n\"Already he has a good understanding with Haaland. Newcastle couldn't live with him.\"\n\"We knew with the dynamic he would be good,\" added Guardiola. \"In Germany he made good numbers and he had three chances last week against [Leyton] Orient but didn't score.\n\"He likes to attack the space. It is simple. When you play well, everybody adapts quick. Hopefully he can handle the biggest compliments because they will come now.\"\nIt was one of those rare occasions when Haaland didn't score and contributed a single assist, for James McAtee, six minutes from time.\nYet his industry was notable, leading from the front in a performance befitting his status as captain for the first time.\nNormally, Guardiola stays out of the captaincy issue, preferring to let the players decide on the leadership group.\nHowever, with club skipper Kyle Walker now at AC Milan, others who have done the job previously, Kevin de Bruyne and Bernardo, on the bench and Ilkay Gundogan overlooked for the role since his return from Barcelona in the summer, Guardiola stepped in to make sure Haaland - who last month signed a new deal that runs to 2034 - took the role.\n\"When Kyle left, Kevin became the first but I nominated Erling, not them,\" said the City boss.\n\"When a player is going to be here 10 years, sooner or later, you need to take the responsibility. He did it for the first time.\"\nGuardiola also played down the injury Haaland appeared to suffer in the final minutes.\nThe Norway international initially sat down and flexed his leg before the physios came on. It was immediately decided to take him off.\nHowever, Haaland watched the remainder of the game from the bench and went back on to the pitch to shake hands with opposition players after the final whistle.\n\"When he went down, everyone was scared,\" added Guardiola.\n\"But he got up and walked away smiling as always. I didn't speak with him but the doctors didn't come with bad news.

They keep goats - primarily to make cheese and occasionally for meat - as well as chickens, grow their own vegetables and manage the site's woodland.\nThe building runs off hydropower and a tiny wind turbine and is heated by a log burner. \nThey host weekly Welsh language classes, run workshops, open days and volunteer weeks to demonstrate their way of life.\nMany in the community have jobs away from the farm, they eat communally five times a week and, before the community's families left ahead of the eviction notice, the children were home-schooled.\nWill and the other members each pay rent as well as their contribution to \"food club\", bills, and a savings pot for expenses such as building repairs. \nWith no-one in charge, decisions are made collaboratively and their shared values include inclusivity, gratitude and valuing learning and culture. \nDoes living in this way come with the occasional conflict?\n\"There absolutely are difficulties at times,\" admitted Will.\n\"Occasionally conflicts happen... but there are far fewer than there are beautiful times.\"\nHe said the community tried to take blame out of conflict.\n\"A conflict for me is when we find a glitch in the way in which we're working, no-one's at fault,\" he said.\nHe said \"detangling\" conflicts when there was no-one in charge was \"very deep and intense work and often very painful, but by the end of it we find ourselves stronger, more beautiful, able to act with each other in a more beautiful way\".\nRosie Gilam, who grew up in nearby Cardigan, is Will's partner and spends about three days a week with him at Brithdir Mawr.\nShe has been visiting the community since she was a child and previously lived in communities in Cornwall. \n\"A major wonderful thing about being human is to accept others for what they are, understand they've got their own needs which might not intersect completely with your needs, and to come to a place where you're accepting of your differences and find a way to work together,\" she said.\n\"I think that is so needed on the planet at the moment.\" \nLike Will, she insisted \"nobody's to blame\" for the community's current predicament. \nShe said the situation was an example of \"broken systems\" which meant \"tenants don't have rights, a family can be turfed out of its home with little notice, and that people generally don't have affordable access to land\". \nShe hopes media attention on Brithdir Mawr will start a conversation about land rights and be \"one step towards systemic change\". \n\"So for example, there might be community right to buy, which means that a community like this in the future would have the right to buy an asset,\" she said.  \nAndromeda Gervasio, who is from Portugal, moved to the UK 12 years ago, and moved to Brithdir Mawr last summer after feeling burnt out with city life, \"craving a different lifestyle\" and being drawn to \"intentional community\".\n\"The water is the purest water I've ever drank, and the food is the best food I've ever eaten,\" they said.\n\"People are here not just because, there's a bigger purpose of really living together and sharing the work that it is to live and to live in a place like this... it's pretty incredible.\"\nThey said they cherished being accepted in the countryside. \n\"Being a queer person in the rural landscape has always been something that I was generally scared about... and then actually discovering it and feeling incredibly safe here, I've been so grateful... and I think that I owe lots to Brithdir in that regard,\" they said.\nLike the rest of their community, Andromeda insisted they did not feel animosity towards the new owner. \n\"We're not up against a particular person but a system and a normalised way of going about things,\" they said.\n\"Just because someone has the legal backing to do something, it doesn't necessarily make it okay or how the world should be.\n\"We have a history of things that were within legal bounds not corresponding to what is morally OK to do... [denying] women's rights, slavery and queer witch hunts were all legal at some point.\"\nFor now, what will happen next for the community is uncertain.  \n\"Essentially I feel really, really sad about it,\" said Rosie. \nShe lives in hope of all parties sitting down together and looking for a solution \"with an open heart\". \nWill is confident a resolution can be found.\n\"I don't know exactly what that would look like and that's OK,\" he said. \n\"This complexity and this difficulty feels very difficult, feels gnarly and unpleasant, but also I truly believe that something very special is happening.\n\"I look forward to this process continuing and resolving in a way that works for everyone in the near future.\"",

I thought I just did enough but no excuses,\" said Catterall.\nBarboza Jr extended his unbeaten record to 32 pro wins \nEurope's largest indoor arena \u2013 with a capacity of 23,500 - was around a third full as a boisterous crowd repeatedly chanted 'Chorley' to welcome Lancastrian Catterall to the ring.\nQuite fittingly, he made his entrance to the song 'I just can't wait to be king' from the Lion King.\nCatterall, who started boxing aged 11 and turned pro in 2012, is a reserved family man, yet there has been a swagger and spring in his step throughout fight week. \nBarboza, though, had won all 31 of his pro fights and arrived in the UK full of confidence on the back of a career-best win over Jose Ramirez in November.\nNeither fighter was willing to overcommit early on and Catterall edged the first two rounds with the cleaner work. The Californian responded well, cutting off the ring and landing jabs and good body shots.\nA terrific counter-puncher, southpaw Catterall's approach, while appreciated by purists, does not always lend to the most entertaining of styles.\nHe landed a great two-punch combination in the sixth round, before his rival returned the favour with a flush right.\nCatterall was warned for a low blow in the seventh and, as the round drew to a close, his legs dipped after a right from Barboza.\nThe Catterall faithful turned the volume up a notch when the American hit the canvas in the 11th. He instantly shot up to his feet and protested a slip, with replays showing he fell over Catterall's trailing leg as a jab landed.\nBarboza and Catterall both celebrated at the final bell as pundits and ringside reporters shrugged their shoulders and compared contrasting scorecards with the decision too close to call.\nA frustrated Catterall was consoled by trainer Jamie Moore\n\nThe loss was disappointing for Catterall, who was enjoying a golden period in his career. In the past 15 months, he had beaten former champions Taylor, Jorge Linares and Regis Prograis.\nBut he came up against an undefeated foe who was motivated by his own pursuit for world honours.\n\"I want to see him go and fight for the world title, hopefully he beats Teofimo,\" added Catterall. \"It's straight back to the gym for me.\"\nCatterall missed out on becoming England's first male undisputed champion in the four-belt era when he lost to Taylor three years ago in Glasgow. Most ringside observers felt he should have been awarded the decision against the Scot.\nIf he does not ever win a world title, that loss \u2013 and the injustice of it \u2013 may unfortunately be what 'El Gato' will be most remembered for.\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Barboza, though, had won all 31 of his pro fights and arrived in the UK full of confidence on the back of a career-best win over Jose Ramirez in November.Neither fighter was willing to overcommit early on and Catterall edged the first two rounds with the cleaner work. I thought I just did enough but no excuses,\" said Catterall.Decision too close to call in cagey affairImage source, Matchroom BoxingImage caption, Barboza Jr extended his unbeaten record to 32 pro wins Europe's largest indoor arena \u2013 with a capacity of 23,500 - was around a third full as a boisterous crowd repeatedly chanted 'Chorley' to welcome Lancastrian Catterall to the ring.Quite fittingly, he made his entrance to the song 'I just can't wait to be king' from the Lion King.Catterall, who started boxing aged 11 and turned pro in 2012, is a reserved family man, yet there has been a swagger and spring in his step throughout fight week.",

        "article_text": "Whether it's the echo of beeping tills in a supermarket or the hissing of a coffee machine in your local caf\u00e9, the brain is constantly working to decode hundreds of noises each day.\nBut, for some, those background noises can become so overwhelming that they distract them from recognising voices or alerts.\nThis is the reality for Sophie, a 25-year-old administration assistant from London, who is used to being told she doesn't listen, zones out, or is \"a bit ditsy\".\n\"Even though I can hear that there are noises going on, I can't listen to where the noise is coming from. I know it's the person's voice, I just can't really compute it quick enough,\" she said.\nAfter a hearing test came back normal, Sophie met a private audiologist for further testing. She was eventually diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD), a neurological condition where the brain finds it difficult to understand sounds and spoken words.\nHer audiologist and others in England are now calling for more research into whether the condition is linked to overuse of noise-cancelling headphones. \nHaving grown up on a peaceful farm in the countryside, it wasn't until a few years ago when Sophie started university in London that she noticed a change in her hearing - specifically trouble identifying where a sound was coming from.\nShe rarely attended her university lectures in person, instead opting to watch them online and with subtitles. \n\"All the words sounded like gibberish when I was in the actual lecture, and I was trying to hear,\" she said.\nIt affected her social life too and Sophie would leave bars and restaurants early because of the \"overwhelming noise\".\nThe cause of Sophie's APD diagnosis is unknown, but her audiologist believes the overuse of noise-cancelling headphones, which Sophie wears for up to five hours a day, could have a part to play.\nOther audiologists agree, saying more research is needed into the potential effects of their prolonged use.\nFive NHS audiology departments have told the BBC that there has been an increase in the number of young people referred to them from GPs with hearing issues - only to find their hearing is normal when tested and it is their ability to process sound that is struggling.\nAPD is more common in neurodiverse people, those who have suffered from a brain injury or had a middle-ear infection as a child. However, more patients with APD are presenting outside of those categories, leaving audiologists to question if external factors, such as noise-cancelling headphones, are contributing.\nRenee Almeida, an adult audiology clinical lead at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, says it is important to hear a diversity of sounds so the brain can decide what is important to focus on.\nHer team has seen an increase in the amount of young people referred for hearing services in the last year. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. We can see that listening skills are suffering.\"\nNoise-cancelling headphones do have their benefits, particularly for long-term ear health where their soundproofing feature can prevent high frequency and loud noise from reaching and damaging the ear - even while listening to music.\nLisa Barber, technology editor at Which?, said the devices had \"exploded in popularity\" in recent years. But the level of transparency can vary from model to model. \n\"Some simply offer passive noise cancelling, where the acoustic seal between the headphones and your ears reduces nearby noise,\" she said. Others have a transparency mode that allows you to hear partial background noise.\nBut Claire Benton, vice-president of the British Academy of Audiology, suggests that by blocking everyday sounds such as cars beeping, there is a possibility the brain can \"forget\" to filter out the noise.\n\"You have almost created this false environment by wearing those headphones of only listening to what you want to listen to. You are not having to work at it,\" she said.\n\"Those more complex, high-level listening skills in your brain only really finish developing towards your late teens. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.\nFor those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.\nA UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.\nAnd, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.\nProf Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD. \"It is a costly service because it is not just an audiogram, the test can take up to two hours and it requires additional assessments. In adults I also refer them for a cognitive assessment and in children I may also need to speak to an educational psychologist.\"\nParticularly after the pandemic, behaviours and engagement with visuals and audio has changed. This comes in part due to new products and technology, as well as increased anxiety in noisy environments after the lockdown. \nIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. One YouGov survey showed that 61% of 18-24 year olds prefer to watch TV with the subtitles on.\nDr Angela Alexander, audiologist and owner of APD Support, a private organisation, is among the audiologists calling for more research into the impact of noise-cancelling headphones on auditory processing, particularly in children. \n\"What does the future look like if we don't investigate this link? There are a lot of well-meaning parents and teachers who think the answer to children having problems with noise is to wear ear plugs or having noise-cancelling headphones on.\"\nDr Amjad Mahmood, the head of audiology at Great Ormond Street Hospital supported the call for more research. \nHe said there had been a \"significant increase in demand\" for assessments at the hospital's large APD clinic for under-16s. \"especially with difficulties noticed at school\".\nTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.\nSo-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. But training can vary and includes practice with auditory discrimination too, such as how to distinguish separate sounds in words like seventy and seventeen, and free and three.\nMicrophones and low-gain hearing aids can also be provided to help the patient in certain situations, such as a meeting or classroom work, but adults outside the education system are not entitled to these products on the NHS.\n\"Right now I can hear there is a fan above my head but my brain is telling me that is not something I need to worry about,\" says Dr Alexander, describing what is called auditory scene analysis.\n\"It's the way we identify threats in our environment, so it makes sense to me that there would be an increase in anxiety if a person's brain no longer has those inputs helping tell them what is a concern and what is not.\"\nTo improve this, Dr Alexander suggests reducing headphone use time and using the transparency mode which can amplify the background noise as well as wearing headphones that don't completely occlude or block the ears.\nWayne Wilson, an associate professor in the school of health and rehabilitation sciences at The University of Queensland, says more research needs to be done on the possible link.\nHowever, he points out that doing controlled research with so many variables could prove tricky. \n\"The devil is in the detail as the answer probably depends on which sounds, which scenes, which noise, which noise cancellation, what period of noise cancellation, what age of child, etc.\"\nSophie is set to start treatment for her APD in the next few months, and feels excited for the future. \n\"If me and my boyfriend go out to a bar, sometimes we will leave early because of the noise. It's nice to know maybe after this treatment, I will be able to go to busier places and handle it a bit better.\"",

Getty ImagesGreat Ormond Street Hospital for Children have seen an increase in demand for assessments of children struggling to hear certain words in noisy environmentsIt is now common to see people walking outside wearing their noise-cancelling headphones and watching videos online with subtitles, despite perfectly hearing the sound. She said: \"There is a difference between hearing and listening. 'Having a hearing dog is like winning the lottery'Could solar-powered headphones be the next must-have?Study finds 18m people in the UK have hearing lossTreatment for APD can make a significant positive difference, with some patients able to make a full recovery.So-called \"word in noise\" training exercises on mobile apps have become a popular way of practising pulling speech from background noise. So, if you have only been wearing noise-cancelling headphones and been in this false world for your late teens then you are slightly delaying your ability to process speech and noise,\" Benton suggests.For those experiencing difficulties with sound processing in England, APD care in the NHS is limited.A UK-wide survey from 2024, distributed by the BAA and ENT UK, the professional body representing ear, nose and throat surgery, found that only 4% of audiologists consider themselves to be well-informed on APD.And, for those who are 16 years and over, the Royal National ENT and Eastman Hospital is the only NHS provider in England offering a full APD assessment and the waiting list is nine months long.Prof Doris-Eva Bamiou, who carries out the assessments there, says this is partially down to the time it takes to diagnose APD.",

        "article_text": "A new advisory body created by US President Donald Trump and led by the world's richest man has been tasked with cutting US government jobs and other spending.\nElon Musk is leading this effort to drastically reduce the federal workforce and weed out what he sees as taxpayers' money being wasted.\nBut his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) has encountered legal obstacles, allegations of conflicts of interest, and fears that it will wreak serious damage.\nExplaining his actions to reporters in the Oval Office, Musk defended his plans and denied the assertion of rival Democrats that he embodied a \"hostile takeover\" of government.\nPolling suggests cutting government spending has widespread support.\nDespite its full name, Doge is not an official government department, which would have had to be established by an act of Congress.\nInstead it came into being through one of Trump's presidential executive orders, and operates as an advisory body with at least four employees dedicated to each government agency.\nPart of Doge's mission, says the order, relates to IT upgrades aimed at boosting efficiency. It must finish its work by July 2026.\nMany of Doge's staff appear to be young people with tech backgrounds. \nYes. Musk initially said he would perform his role as an outside volunteer but the White House later said he was operating as an unpaid special government employee.\nThat designation is officially defined as those working for the government for 130 days or less in a year.\nTo some supporters of this new body, Doge's outsider status - as well as its somewhat vague mandate - will increase its effectiveness.\n\"They're a little more untethered to the bureaucracy itself and to the systems that slow processes down around here,\" Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told the BBC. \"I think the lack of parameters is part of what will make them effective.\"\nIts mission, says Musk, is to save taxpayers' money and reduce US national debt, which stands at $36tn (\u00a328.9tn).\nInitially he said he hoped to save as much as $2tn a year, but later tempered this estimate.\nMusk has said he wants to end the \"tyranny of the bureaucracy\", what he describes as a fourth branch of government working against Trump's agenda. Critics of his work see a simpler ideological motivation at play.\n\"They are not going to go into agencies that are doing things they like. They are going into agencies they disagree with,\" Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Republican director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), told Reuters news agency.\nIt is unclear how much money Doge has managed to save so far, although its X account gives regular, celebratory updates on what they say has been cut. Among its headline-making actions are:\n\nDoge enjoys broad popular support, a poll by the BBC's US partner CBS News has suggested. \nThis indicated that a majority of Americans - especially Republican voters - supported its work, even if they disagreed over how much influence Musk should have personally.\nThe size of the permanent workforce currently exceeds two million and one of the largest increases was in 2023, partly due to major investment by the Biden administration in infrastructure projects.\nDavid Ditch, a senior analyst at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a conservative think tank, says Doge's work is needed. \n\"They're shining a very bright spotlight on various parts of the federal government and they asking, whether it's the American public, whether it's moderate members of the Republican caucus - is this how you want America's tax dollars to be used?\"\nPolitical opponents and government watchdogs accuse Doge of acting without transparency and spreading misinformation about government spending - and accuse Musk of overstepping his authority as an unelected official.\nCritics highlight Musk's potential conflicts of interest, given the billions in contracts his businesses hold with the US government. Trump and Musk deny that any issues will arise.\nMultiple groups including unions and state attorneys general have sued Doge and the wider Trump administration over their plans, and Democrats accuse them of tampering with funding approved by Congress that is outside the president's scope. The White House denies that the work has broken any laws.\nSeveral times, the courts have stepped in to halt the cost-cutting moves, at least once blocking Doge directly when a judge stopping the agency from accessing personal data held within US Treasury records. \nThey have scored some small victories, though. A federal judge in Washington DC ruled that Doge's work can proceed while the litigation plays out.  \nWhen speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Musk said he expected to be scrutinised for his work, but insisted that Americans had voted for \"common sense\" government reform.\nBut pundits question whether he can enact his bold pledges.\nElaine Kamark, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, told the BBC that efforts to streamline government spending \"can be done\", highlighting her own work for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.\nBut she labelled Musk's idea of slashing a third of government spending \"ridiculous\", since so much of the budget was mandatory, including popular programmes like Social Security and Medicare.\nWith additional reporting by Jessica Parker and Cai Pigliucci",

The scanner will be used to survey a trial route multiple times over a period of several months using laser technology to read the road surface and look for tiny changes as cracks widen in the cold and wet winter weather.Tracking small changes over time could help the team to identify the early warning signs of deterioration, meaning future potholes could be fixed before they form, the council said.Mr Bibby added: \"We know that our residents care about roads and pavements in the county, and the changeable weather we've had over the last few months, including excessive rainfall and long periods of colder weather, all contribute to potholes appearing and a decline in road surfaces. \"He said fixing potholes would remain a challenge, but he hoped the new AI technology could help identify issues at an early stage. The council said it was proposing an increase of \u00a36m in next year's budget for the maintenance of its highways. \"The dimensions, location, and severity level of defects are displayed on a remote screen in near real time, helping highways engineers to plan road resurfacing programmes and pothole fixes more effectively, the council said.",

        "article_text": "Sir Keir Starmer has said any Ukraine peace deal would require a \"US backstop\" to deter Russia from attacking its neighbour again. \nSpeaking after a hastily convened meeting with European leaders in Paris, he said a \"US security guarantee was the only way to effectively deter Russia\", and vowed to discuss the \"key elements\" of a peace deal with US President Donald Trump in Washington next week. \nThe prime minister repeated that he would consider deploying UK troops to Ukraine in the event of a lasting peace agreement. \nBut Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a key Nato ally, said for his part, discussing sending troops to Ukraine at present was \"completely premature\".\nSir Keir said Europe would \"have to do more\" to defend the continent in the face of the \"generational\" security challenge Russia posed.\nHe avoided explaining exactly what he meant by a \"backstop\" - but his allies suggest this could involve air support, logistics and intelligence capabilities.\nThe talks at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace were held to discuss concerns over the Trump administration's decision to initiate peace talks with Russia - due to start in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday - alone. \nSir Keir was joined by the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, as well as the president of the European Council and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Kyiv did not know about talks in Saudi Arabia and would not recognise any agreement made without its involvement.\nUS officials have suggested European nations would be consulted on peace talks with Russia, but not directly involved in them.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron posted on X in the early hours of Tuesday that he had \"just spoken\" with Trump and Zelensky.\n\"We will work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians. This is the key,\" he said, adding that he \"will continue these discussions in the coming days\".\nPrior to the meeting, the European leaders had also expressed concern after US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was \"unrealistic\" to expect Ukraine would return to its borders before 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. \nHegseth downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato - something Sir Keir had said it was on an \"irreversible\" path towards.\nHe also said Europe would have to be primarily responsible for guaranteeing its own security going forward.\nSir Keir said the US was \"not going to leave Nato\" but that it was \"time to take responsibility for our security, our continent\".\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said transatlantic relations were in a \"new stage\",  and that the meeting had confirmed the time had come for \"a much greater ability for Europe to defend itself\".\nSir Keir has indicated any troop contributions from the UK would be part of a multinational force to police the border between Ukrainian-held and Russian-held territory.\nBut experts say to do so effectively would be a massive undertaking that would require a large increase in defence spending.\nLiberal Democrats leader Ed Davey called on Sir Keir to recall Parliament to discuss plans to defend Ukraine.\nParliament is currently in recess and is due to reconvene on 24 February.\nSir Keir's spokesperson said Parliament would be consulted \"as appropriate\" but this was \"getting ahead of discussions\" with other world leaders.\nMalcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the Royal United Services Institute, said that, unlike UN peacekeeping forces there to observe, if the force being proposed was intended to deter Russian attacks, it would be a \"whole different matter altogether\".\n\"You need credible, well-armed forces - and you not only need frontline forces, you need back-up forces, and air forces, and so on,\" he told the BBC. \"That's a much bigger ask.\"\nGeneral Sir Adrian Bradshaw, a former Nato commander, said: \"This cannot be a token force, it cannot be something that observes bad behaviour and stands on the sideline.\"\nThe former head of the British Army, Lord Dannatt, previously estimated such a force would need around 100,000 troops - with the UK contributing about two-fifths.\n\"We just haven't got that number available,\" he said on Saturday, adding that getting the military into shape to perform this role would come at a considerable cost.\nThe UK currently spends around 2.3% of its total economic output on defence. The government has committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5%, but has not said when this will be achieved.\nSir Keir earlier told reporters that the government would set out a path to meeting the 2.5% commitment once it finishes its strategic defence review.\n\"Part of my message to our European allies is that we've all got to step up on both capability and on spending and funding,\" he said. \n\"That includes the UK, which is why I've made that commitment to spend more.\"\nSome European figures have signalled their agreement with this. \nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Europe had to \"step up\" defence spending and support for Ukraine, as \"Russia is threatening all of Europe now, unfortunately\", while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a \"surge\" in defence spending.\nNo 10 confirmed Sir Keir's trip to Washington earlier on Monday, after a minister said the UK could serve as a \"bridge\" between the US and Europe.\nThe BBC understands the PM offered to host a follow-up meeting of European leaders following the Washington trip. \nPoland's Tusk has already indicated his nation would not send troops into Ukraine, but would continue to support it with military, financial and humanitarian aid.\nUK government sources argue it is \"no surprise\" there was a difference of opinion between leaders, and that not every nation is willing to show their hand quite yet.\nBritish diplomats do not believe every nation would need to commit to contributing troops - but some would. And whatever Europe's eventual role, US involvement would still be required.\nProf Chalmers said: \"Having significant numbers of Nato troops on Ukrainian soil after a ceasefire would be a failure for Russia, so it's hard for me at this point to see Russia accepting such a presence as a part of the deal.\"\nFighting on the ground in Ukraine continued over the weekend, with at least three civilians killed in Russian strikes on Sunday, according to local authorities.\nSeveral areas of Ukraine are under an emergency blackout following attacks on energy infrastructure, while Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted and destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones on Sunday night.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments. \nIt'll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",

        "article_text": "The BBC looks into the psychology behind travel souvenirs: why we buy them, their impact on local communities and the planet, and how we can shop more thoughtfully.\nOn a recent backpacking trip through the Himalayas, my bruises became the truest souvenirs. Three months later, many of the contusions remain \u2013 stubborn scars with no intention of fading. More personal than anything I could have bought, they carry a backstory only I can tell, and I know exactly where they came from, with no hidden costs to the planet or people. Perhaps that's why, over time, my desire for typical souvenirs has faded. I now value experiences over objects \u2013 looking for meaning in what I bring back rather than just another trinket.\nBut maybe that's just me. Two out of three Americans bring back a souvenir from their travels, with US sales topping $21bn\u00a0(\u00a316.7bn) in 2022. The souvenir industry has drawn criticism for its reliance on mass production and cultural appropriation. Still, it remains to be an often-overlooked side of tourism's impact. Frequent flyers face scrutiny, but trinket collectors rarely do. Innovative ways to preserve memories remain largely unrealised. And when a friend hands me a fridge magnet stamped with their latest destination, I cringe. What does it really mean to take home a piece of a place, and at what cost?\nHumans have always had a penchant for collecting things. The Romans brought home spices, animal skins and rare artefacts to commemorate their travels and conquests. In the 18th Century, iconic locations like the Rome's Colosseum and Stonehenge in England were plundered by souvenir-seekers.\nWith the rise of industralisation and capitalism, a lot changed: the world became more connected, tourism boomed and profits took centre stage. But the human need to remember stayed. \"Looking at a souvenir can bring back happy emotions as the brain links it to positive experiences,\" said Vaishnavi Madarkal, a psychologist and therapist based in India. \"This connection can happen with anything \u2013 [whether it's] an object, music or a smell.\"\nThe word \"souvenir\" comes from French, meaning \"memory\" or \"remembrance\". But the allure of souvenirs goes beyond memories. According to Madarkal, often it's the dopamine rush of retail therapy or cultural gift-giving norms. Take Japan's omiyage tradition, where travellers bring back small edible gifts for friends, family and co-workers. I, too, have picked up presents like saffron and piment\u00f3n in Spain or seaweed chips in Thailand, wanting to share my travels with loved ones.\nFor many, souvenirs go beyond tangible reminders and material gifts \u2013 they satisfy a deeper need to say, \"I was there!\" \"At the core of our actions is a desire to feel heard, seen and validated,\" explains Madarkal. \"The same holds for why we may buy souvenirs.\"\nTHOUGHTFUL TRAVEL\nWant to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\nBut how does this fit into a world already overwhelmed by excess? \"The era of innocent tourism \u2013 where it was seen as a benign and universally positive force \u2013 ended around 2015,\" says Justin Francis, co-founder of Responsible Travel, a UK-based travel agency specialising in ethical tourism. \"In Europe and America, protests against overtourism are growing. People are realising their vacations can leave lasting impacts on others' homes.\"\nYet, while travellers today are more aware of their impact, souvenirs have been somewhat left behind. With 25 years in the travel industry, Francis offers a macro perspective. \"Though we haven't fully shifted yet, things have changed,\" he said. \"I've often witnessed travellers examine products, and ask, 'Where did this come from?'\"\nIn a world flooded with mass-produced items and fake markets, this question is crucial. A 2022 report by the Australian Government's Productivity Commission found that up to 75% of souvenirs marketed as \"Indigenous\" in Australia were counterfeit, with boomerangs and didgeridoos traced to Indonesia. Meanwhile, more than 70% of Thailand's popular elephant pants are made overseas. The battle of pashmina shawl artisans against cheaper, mass-produced alternatives is also well known.\n\"In the Leh market [in Kashmir, India], about 95% of fabrics sold as pashmina aren't genuine,\" says Sonam Angmo, co-founder of Lena Ladakh Pashmina, a slow textile brand focused on preserving the pashmina legacy while supporting local artisans. \"[The fake fabric] is mass-produced in places like Ludhiana and Punjab then brought to Ladakh by outsiders.\"\nA genuine pashmina shawl can cost upwards of 30,000 rupees (\u00a3280) due to the effort of raising goats in harsh climates and handcrafting the shawls. But for many travellers, this price is out of reach. As a result, some shops sell imitation shawls for 3,000-5,000 rupees (\u00a327.4-\u00a345.7), with most customers simply seeking a pashmina \"bought in Ladakh\" and giving little regard to its origins.\nThe high cost of genuine pashmina has driven demand for counterfeits, with the profitability of fake or \"semi-pashmina\" ensuring a steady supply. Angmo aptly calls this a \"vicious cycle\" that impacts local communities dependent on tourism. Frustrated by the difficulty of selling authentic items, some artisans resort to purchasing fake fabrics or working with mechanised looms. \"It's how they feed their families,\" Angmo explains. This may create a dilemma for shoppers: while purchasing counterfeit goods might seem to support local retailers, the true cost is often borne by artisans who rely on time-honoured craftsmanship.\nOne thing is clear: the desire to immortalise our travels isn't going anywhere. What's more, many communities, like those around busy tourist sites like Angkor Wat in Cambodia or Petra in Jordan, have thrived by turning souvenirs into a source of livelihood. Perhaps it's not about avoiding souvenirs entirely, but about making responsible choices.\nIt used to be easier to spot genuine local souvenirs. In places like Fez, Morocco, travellers could expect every leather good in the medina's souks to come from the city's iconic tanneries. But today's knockoffs are so sophisticated that even experts may struggle to distinguish them.\nBesides, most souvenirs are small, portable and affordable \u2013 qualities that make them appealing. This explains why many of the world's most popular souvenirs fit this mould. Meanwhile, sellers are more aware of consumer mindfulness, often marketing items as \"handcrafted\" or \"recycled\", though the truth can be far from the label. When so many forces are at play, even the best intentions to be mindful and responsible can become difficult to uphold.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 The new museum trend helping us regain our lost attention\n\u2022\u00a0 How will air pollution change where and when we travel?\n\u2022\u00a0 What makes a tourist attraction?\nSo, how can you buy souvenirs that are ethical, sustainable and meaningful? Sonam and Francis both agree: ask questions. \"Be curious\u2026 it's not just about buying or choosing carefully, it's about rejecting and explaining why,\" said Francis. \"You could say, 'This sculpture is beautiful, but I'm concerned about its environmental impact.'\"\nSrishti Tehri, a mindful traveller and content creator, emphasises being patient when souvenir hunting. She loves magnets for their daily visibility, but not just any magnet. \"I try to find the most interesting ones and put them on my wall of fame \u2013 my fridge,\" she says. \"I go the extra mile for unique designs or to support an artist. The generic ones are mostly ugly and feel like a scam.\" I agree. My rule: if every shop carries the same design, it's likely mass-produced.\nAnother way to ethically shop is to support reputable cooperatives and fair-trade markets. For instance, Women in Hebron features embroidered products and handicrafts by Palestinian women. Bangkok's Artist House, a centuries-old Thai wooden home, sells live portraits and wooden Muay Thai figurines and even offers opportunities to create your own souvenir.\nMany countries now certify authentic local goods, too. In India, genuine pashmina shawls bear GI (Geographical Indication) tags; Australia uses the black-and-red Indigenous Art Code logo; and the S\u00e1mi Doudji label in Nordic countries guarantees items are made by S\u00e1mi artisans.\nIntentions also matter. I no longer buy souvenirs on every trip \u2013 for myself or others. When I do, I ensure they're meaningful. Sometimes, I even ask friends what they want instead of guessing. Tehri echoes this: \"I never buy the same thing for everyone. My love language shifts \u2013 some prefer something utilitarian; others love collectables.\"\nA good souvenir doesn't always have to be bought or tangible. When you think beyond \"souvenirs\" and more about what sparks memories, the possibilities get exciting. Maybe it's a letter sent from your destination, a well-kept travel journal, or even something salvaged \u2013 like beer caps or ticket stubs. Some travellers capture the sounds of their adventures while others take home tattoos. Join a cooking class, and you can take home a souvenir that keeps giving \u2013 new culinary skills.\nUltimately, there's no universal rule for what makes a \"responsible\" souvenir; it's a personal decision we each make. But next time you're grabbing a quick airport trinket or ticking off your gift list, pause and reflect.\n\"We live in a world of faceless transactions,\" says Francis. \"If you think back to the Silk Road, trade was personal. You met the seller, exchanged something of value and that made the trade meaningful.\" Souvenirs, he believes, offer a chance to reclaim that intimacy. By buying directly from the maker, witnessing their craft and cutting out middlemen, you experience what Francis calls \"the purest form of commerce\".\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

Another contentious topic has been \"category fraud\" \u2013 that is, the phenomenon of actors being nominated in categories where many believe they don't really belong. \"Absolute category fraud\" said one X user, of Kieran Culkin's best supporting actor nod for A Real Pain. \"It's time to stop the category fraud madness,\" said another, referring to both Culkin and Zoe Salda\u00f1a's supporting actress nomination for Emilia P\u00e9rez. And there are many more posts like these. Kyle Wilson said in a piece for The Ringer in November that this was poised to be \"the fraudiest awards season in Oscar history\".\nStill, we shouldn't get carried away. No one is accusing anyone else of committing actual fraud. The practice they're talking about is simply a long-established way of boosting actors' chances of winning an Academy Award (or a Bafta or a Golden Globe), by placing one co-lead in a lead acting category and the other into the supporting, rather than have them compete against each other. Nate Jones in Vulture has called it an \"understandable bit of gamesmanship\". But Michael Schulman, the author of Oscar Wars: A History of Hollywood in Gold, Sweat and Tears, tells the BBC that \"category fraud is particularly egregious this year\".\nThe films being criticised are the aforementioned Emilia P\u00e9rez and A Real Pain, plus Wicked, all of which are on the shortlist for Best picture. All three films are dominated by pairs of actors of the same gender who have almost equal amounts to do, rather than playing lead roles and supporting roles. For instance, when Wicked was a Broadway show, the actresses playing Elphaba and Galinda, Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, were both nominated for the Tony award for Best actress in a musical, so it would seem logical that the actresses playing Elphaba and Galinda in the big-screen adaptation, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, should both be in the running for best actress prizes. But that's not what has happened. At the Oscars and the Baftas, Erivo has been nominated as a lead actress, and Grande as a supporting actress.\nSome say the categories occupied by the two stars of Emilia P\u00e9rez are even more questionable. The film divides its time between characters played by Salda\u00f1a and Karla Sofia Gasc\u00f3n \u2013 and according to Matthew Stewart, who has crunched the numbers for Screen Time Central, Salda\u00f1a is on screen and/or on the soundtrack for 57 minutes and 50 seconds, or 43.69% of the film, which is slightly more than Gasc\u00f3n's 52 minutes and 21 seconds, or 39.54%. And yet it is Gasc\u00f3n who has been nominated for a lead actress Oscar and Bafta, and Salda\u00f1a who is on the \"supporting\" shortlist.\nBut the alleged \"category fraud\" that is really getting film journalists and social-media commentators hot under the collar pertains to Culkin in A Real Pain. Stewart has calculated that the film's writer/director, Jesse Eisenberg has more screen time (62 minutes and 29 seconds) than Culkin does (58 minutes and six seconds), but the film is obviously about the relationship between two cousins who are almost always on screen together. They are as much co-leads as Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon were in Thelma & Louise \u2013 and yet while Davis and Sarandon were both shortlisted for best actress Oscars in 1992, Culkin has been nominated as best supporting actor at the Oscars and the Baftas alike. Last year, Culkin took home the Golden Globe for Best performance by a male actor in a television series \u2013 drama for his portrayal of Succession's Roman Roy \u2013 he was up against his onscreen brother Jeremy Strong in the same category.\n\"There are no official rules delineating a lead versus supporting performance, and Academy members can vote however they want,\" says Schulman. \"In practice, though, the actors and the studios choose how to position the cast, through 'For Your Consideration' ads and the like. The positioning is often strategic, so that two co-stars aren't splitting the vote, or so a semi-lead can cannonball into the supporting race.\" It's worth recalling that neither Davis nor Sarandon won an Oscar for Thelma & Louise, so the fact that they were up against each other may indeed have split the vote. In contrast, Salda\u00f1a and Grande have been put into different categories from their co-stars, and they are the current top two favourites to win the best supporting actress prize. Meanwhile, Culkin \u2013 \"a semi-lead\", to use Schulman's phrase \u2013 is a dead cert to win an Academy Award for best supporting actor. If he had been on the leading actor list, up against Adrien Brody, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Ralph Fiennes, his chances of taking home a statuette would have been a lot smaller. The BBC contacted both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and Bafta regarding the issue of \"category fraud\", as well representatives of the three films in question, Emilia P\u00e9rez, A Real Pain and Wicked, but all of them are yet to respond.\nSome commentators see \"category fraud\" as out-and-out cheating: the equivalent of entering a Great Dane in a contest to find the world's biggest Chihuahua. But is it really so insidious? Charles Gant, the awards editor of Screen International, admits that he has \"sympathy\" for studios that push actors towards one category or another. \"Why wouldn't Universal, Netflix and Searchlight Pictures try to split their actors into leading and supporting categories,\" he asks. \"Anybody would.\" He also notes that Ampas in the US and Bafta in the UK: \"are not obliged to play ball\"\u00a0\u2013 just because a studio advertises someone as a leading or supporting performer doesn't mean that voters have to agree.\nThe most bizarre instance of voters going their own way came in 2021, when Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield were co-leads in Judas and the Black Messiah. Stanfield was marketed as the lead, and Kaluuya as a supporting actor, and yet, somehow, both men ended up being Oscar-nominated for best supporting actor. In this instance, the two competing nominations didn't split the vote, and Kaluuya won the Academy Award \u2013 but who exactly either performer was meant to be supporting was never explained.\nThe trouble stems from how difficult it is to say what constitutes a \"supporting\" role. \"The word 'supporting' often feels inadequate\u00a0to define a performance,\" says Rich Cline, the chair of the London Film Critics' Circle, \"so it's used\u00a0across a very wide range, from ensemble casts to people who are onscreen throughout a film, like Ariana Grande in Wicked, to someone who comes on briefly and delivers a devastating moment, like Isabella Rossellini in Conclave.\"\nSome journalists argue that timings should be involved \u2013 eg, an actor should have to appear in more than half of a film to be its lead, and less than half of a film to be a supporting player. Others maintain that the distinction between categories depends on more subtle and artistic factors, such as which character evolves the most during the narrative, and whose perspective is prioritised. \"Grande, Salda\u00f1a and Culkin are all in movies that centre on a pair of characters who share more or less equal screen time,\" says Schulman, \"but the protagonists of their films \u2013 the ones who go through the pivotal emotional journey \u2013 are played by Erivo, Gasc\u00f3n, and Eisenberg. Can you really decide who a story is about by using a stopwatch?\"\nCline, too, has come around to the view that A Real Pain is \"told specifically through the perspective of Eisenberg's character\", and so it is legitimate to count Culkin as a supporting actor. He feels the same about Salda\u00f1a's Rita and Gasc\u00f3n's Emilia in Emilia P\u00e9rez. \"Personally, while I was watching the film, I felt that it was Rita's story, with Salda\u00f1a giving the lead performance. Then Netflix quickly\u00a0defined the title role as the lead role in all of their marketing. I can see that, too, as Emilia's journey is so momentous,\u00a0driving the entire narrative, including Rita's arc. So in my voting this season, I have gone along\u00a0with those categories.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The real-life history behind The Brutalist\n\u2022 The most political Oscar nominations ever\n\u2022 Why Emilia P\u00e9rez has caused upset\nConsidering what a subjective business this is, you could just ignore \"category fraud\" and declare that all's fair in love and the Oscars. But, as Schulman says, putting Salda\u00f1a, Grande and Culkin in the supporting categories comes \"at the expense of actors like Isabella Rossellini [in Conclave] and Yura Borisov [in Anora], who have what I think of as exemplary supporting roles: they're on screen for a limited time but make an indelible mark\". As excellent as Rossellini and Borisov are, how are actors with genuine supporting roles meant to compete with those who can show off their skills through the whole of a film? It definitely feels as if the supposedly-supporting-but-actually-lead-actors have an unfair advantage. Just think of Viola Davis, who won the Best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Fences in 2017, beating competitors with much less screen time including Naomie Harris (Moonlight) and Michelle Williams (Manchester by the Sea). \"Was Davis really a supporting character?\" asks Schulman. \"Arguably, but she won the Lead actress Tony Award for playing the same role on Broadway.\"\nAnother eyebrow-raising example is Mahershala Ali's best supporting actor Oscar in 2019, when he was really Viggo Mortensen's co-lead in Green Book (Mortensen was nominated for best actor). And in 2016, Rooney Mara was Cate Blanchett's co-lead in Carol (and she had more screen time), while Alicia Vikander was Eddie Redmayne's co-lead in The Danish Girl \u2013 but both Mara and Vikander were nominated for best supporting actress, and Vikander won the Oscar.\nWeirder still are the examples where it's not just a case of co-leads being separated into discrete categories, but lead and supporting actors swapping places. It's Emma Stone's character who goes on the most significant journey in The Favourite, but she and Rachel Weisz were both classed as supporting actors \u2013 neither won \u2013 leaving the way clear for Olivia Colman to win the Oscar for Lead actress in 2019. And spare a thought for Al Pacino, the star of The Godfather. In 1973, Pacino's Hollywood career was just getting started, while Marlon Brando, in a smaller role, was an icon making a thrilling comeback, so Brando was unjustly placed in the lead actor category, and Pacino had to make do with a supporting actor nod, alongside two of his colleagues from the same film, James Caan and Robert Duvall. With the vote split between the three younger men, it was hardly surprising that none of them won \u2013 Joel Grey nabbed the Best supporting actor Oscar for Cabaret. Brando, on the other hand, won Best actor, and Pacino had to wait another 20 years before he finally got his own Oscar for Scent of a Woman.\nThere are even cases when studios play around with categories in order to stop actors and actresses competing with themselves. In 2009, Kate Winslet had leading roles in two films from different studios, Revolutionary Road and The Reader \u2013 but was suggested in \"For Your Consideration\" ads as a leading actress for the former, and a supporting actress for the latter. However as Gant notes, while\u00a0the Golden Globes played ball and \"nominated her as supporting actress in a drama for The Reader, and leading actress in a drama for Revolutionary Road \u2013 handing her both prizes on the night \u2013 gratifyingly, Bafta and Oscar rebelled. Both said that she had a lead role in The Reader, and nominated her as such. She won leading actress for The Reader at both events\".\nIs \"category fraud\" a slight against under-appreciated character actors giving incontrovertibly supporting performances or just a harmless sign of how arbitrary the Oscars can be? Your answer may depend on how much of a fan you are of the nominees in question. One common theme on social media is that Culkin's nomination may be in the wrong category, but that he's so terrific in A Real Pain that it's hard to begrudge him his inevitable Oscar. Others take a harder line: \"Guy Pearce I'm so sorry that category fraud is about to rob you of your Oscar,\" said one X user, referring to Pearce's best supporting actor nomination for The Brutalist. As for the performers who are up against Grande, Salda\u00f1a and Culkin, they're sure to smile and applaud the winners on Oscar night, but, deep down, they may wish that the Academy had issued voters with stopwatches, after all.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

It's incredible.\"\nMoloney said he particularly enjoyed filming at the beaches in the west of the island.\nHe said: \"I loved filming in the gorgeous St Brelade's Bay, where we lucked out with some lovely August weather and we could swim at lunchtime and have ice cream.\n\"We had another great day on Gorey pier, and in the Driftwood Caf\u00e9 on Archirondel Beach, I loved that place.\"\nThe government, which committed \u00a31.2m to the reboot, said it hoped the series would boost tourism in the island.\nMoloney added: \"I think fans of the original series will love seeing Jersey back on their screens.\"\nZo\u00eb Wanamaker, who plays Charlie Hungerford, said she could \"see why people love it in Jersey\".\nShe said: \"The buildings are gorgeous, and I found out that a lot of them were constructed in the same way as Devon was built on hills in the 1800s. \n\"I also got to visit St Brelade's Bay Hotel, which is right next to another stunning beach - it was a busy summer's day when we were there, and I loved seeing so many families spending time in the sun.\"\nWanamaker said she had \"many friends\" who had featured in the original and that the new series was \"an emotional, challenging ride\".\nWriter Tom Whithouse said Jersey and Bergerac were \"utterly indivisible\".\n\"If you were setting it anywhere else it would have to be a different show. What is interesting about it is that it's a fascinating, strange, incredibly beautiful and very welcoming island,\" he said.\nWhithouse said he hoped fans would enjoy the remake.\nHe said: \"We've taken the fundamental elements from the original show - the rich John Nettles version of the character had a complexity and a darkness to him.\n\"He was always in the tradition of the maverick cop who found himself at odds with the system around him and found that frustrating, because underneath there was a pure drive to do his job and do it well.\"\nExecutive producer Clare Alan said in August that Jersey was \"a character within the series\".\nDirector Colm McCarthy said keeping the show based in Jersey made sense: \"Jersey, both as a location and a character in the story are a big part of what gives Bergerac its distinctive feel.\n\"It's very near to France, so it has this different feel to anywhere else in the UK, it's got a luxurious quality to it.\n\"But also, people come with their own baggage about the ideas of Jersey... all of those different facets give it a place, a feeling that is familiar because it's still British to a British television audience.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X and Facebook.

        "article_text": "UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time.\nUK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban.\nThe MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications.\nAsked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question.\nThe Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK.\nThe rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present.\nThe inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence.\nBBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units.\nThe MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials.\nThe confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge.\nDocuments disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed.\nMike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were \"extremely concerning\".\n\"There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,\" Martin said.\n\"If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,\" he added.\nJohnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard \"horrific\" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces.\nMercer said it was \"very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry\".\nThe MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as \"credible\" evidence of service with the Triples units.\nThe government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD.\nMany are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country.\n\"Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,\" said a former Triples officer. \"The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,\" he said.\nThe officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces \"like brothers\" and felt \"betrayed\" by the widespread rejections.\n\"If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,\" he said.\nThe MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope.\nThe legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan.\n\"Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,\" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn.\n\"As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at.\"\nLawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections.\nIn court filings, they criticised the \"total inadequacy\" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an \"an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation\" of the process.\nNew evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship.\nThe MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role \"evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior\".\nBut officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014.\n\"Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,\" said former officer who served with UKSF.\n\"We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,\" he said.\nThe Ministry of Defence has previously told the BBC: \"There has been no evidence to suggest that any part of the MoD has sought to prevent former members of the Afghan specialist units from giving evidence to the inquiry.\"\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?\nGet in touch using SecureDrop, a highly anonymous and secure way of whistleblowing to the BBC which uses the TOR network.\nOr by using the Signal messaging app, an end-to-end encrypted message service designed to protect your data.\nSignal: 0044 7714 956 936\nPlease note that the SecureDrop link will only work in a Tor browser.

At the state-government level, Texas, Virginia and New York, have already introduced such rules for their employees.DeepSeek's \"large language model\" (LLM) has reasoning capabilities that are comparable to US models such as OpenAI's o1, but reportedly requires a fraction of the cost to train and run.That has raised questions about the billions of dollars being invested into AI infrastructure in the US and elsewhere.International BusinessArtificial intelligence",

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola suggested Manchester City have a \"1%\" chance of qualifying\nPep Guardiola strode into the Bernabeu Stadium's palatial surroundings knowing Manchester City must overturn the odds - and logic - in a special place that usually reserves its miracles for Real Madrid.\nHe has known every emotion in this legendary arena on a Champions League journey that has brought him here with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.\nAnd on Wednesday, Guardiola will once more appear alongside his friend and great adversary, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti, beneath those towering stands knowing victory will rank among his finest achievements.\nGuardiola rates City's chances of overturning a 3-2 deficit from the first leg of this play-off to reach the last 16 as \"1%\".\nAnd, to gauge the opinions of locals in a city that has held more Champions League victory parades than any other, they feel Guardiola is erring on the side of optimism.\nGuardiola was in measured mood when he appeared in front of the media at the Bernabeu, an environment that represented enemy territory during his time as  player and coach with Barcelona - and his message was crystal clear.\n\"We have to make it almost the perfect game,\" he said. \"We have to attack. We have to score goals. This is the idea.\"\nGuardiola is determined City will not leave the Bernabeu wondering or with regrets, saying: \"We must play with courage. We must be ourselves. It will need incredible courage and we must play to win.\n\"We could still lose, but we have to show that courage and be ourselves. We have to play so well, especially after the result we took away in the first leg.\"\nOpta statistics rate City's chances of advancing at a more optimistic 19.8%, but those percentages must be viewed through the prism of Real's history in this tournament and the muscle memory that kicks in for the 15-time winners when it matters.\nGuardiola's record with City against Real is chequered, though it started with victory in the last 16 in 2020, the two legs being played six months apart because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe most bitter moment came two years later when City led by two goals on aggregate in the 90th minute of the semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu, only for Rodrygo to score twice within seconds, Karim Benzema's injury-time penalty sending Real on to eventual victory over Liverpool in the final in Paris.\nWhen Guardiola, as Manchester City manager, claimed his third Champions League crown in 2023, after winning with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Real were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the Spanish champions then prevailing on penalties last season.\nHe said: \"I have some incredible memories here - sometimes good ones, sometimes not so good. \n\"We know at this stage, and in this stadium, the pressure is there - but you get that in Milan, in Barcelona, at Anfield. You have to suffer at these places, but you have to reduce those moments.\"\nReal's remarkable win against City in 2022 is the sort of sporting lightning strike Guardiola will seek to turn back on them, but he must do it with a fading team that has lost its domestic supremacy after winning a historic four successive Premier Leagues, and now faces the prospect of going out of the Champions League before the last 16 for the first time in 12 years.\nCarlo Ancelotti (left) and Pep Guardiola will be meeting in the Champions League for the 10th time\nThe wily Ancelotti was not taking Guardiola's bait about percentages when he spoke in Madrid on Tuesday, saying: \"He doesn't really think that. We don't think we have a 99% chance. We have a small advantage - and we have to take advantage of that.\"\nGuardiola responded: \"For the first time he didn't believe me. I always say what I think, and this time you don't believe me.\"\nStatistics pile up like giant obstacles in front of City's route to the last 16, explaining why Real are overwhelming favourites after two goals in a late surge gave them victory at Etihad Stadium.\nIt was the 40th time Real have won the first leg of a European knockout-stage tie away from home, progressing on 37 of the previous 39 occasions.\nCity's defeat, meanwhile, was the fifth time they have lost the first leg of a Champions League knockout-stage tie, going on to be eliminated on the previous four occasions.\nFor Ancelotti, this tournament's greatest coach with five wins, he will be meeting Guardiola in the Champions League for the 10th time, on eight occasions with Real against City. The Italian has won four of their nine meetings, never losing at home, winning two games and drawing two.\nOf more recent significance is that to unseat the holders, City will have to alter poor form in the competition after losing their past three away games to Sporting, Juventus and Paris St-Germain.\nGuardiola's spirits will be lifted by Saturday's 4-0 win over Newcastle United which included a hat-trick inside 14 first-half minutes for new Egyptian signing Omar Marmoush, while Erling Haaland demonstrated his quality with both goals in the first-leg defeat, his first against Real Madrid.\nHaaland has been prolific in the Champions League, scoring 49 goals in 48 games. If he scores at the Bernabeu, he will become the fastest player to 50 goals in appearances and age, at 24 years and 213 days.\nIt could even be a Champions League farewell to Manchester City for modern greats of the club such as Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and goalkeeper Ederson, while others such as Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic are also in their 30s.\nGuardiola would not be drawn as he said: \"I would like to answer this but it will be at the end of the season. We still have a lot to play for, to qualify for the Champions League next season, we are still there in the Champions League this season. We have the FA Cup and the Club World Cup.\"\nSilva added: \"If you had told me at the start of the season that we would be in this position in the Champions League and the Premier League I wouldn't have believed you. We deserve to be in this complicated situation because of where we finished.\n\"We have to believe. We still believe things can go our way, but this season is certainly a lesson for the future.\"\nFor Manchester City, that future is now - in the forbidding, unforgiving surroundings of the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nAnd if Guardiola can overcome those \"1%\" odds in this footballing cathedral, it will rank alongside the best results of his career.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

It was close to being Ederson because of a goalkeeper getting an assist, but I think Flekken was the better goalkeeper on the day.\nJan Paul van Hecke (Brighton): I watched the Brighton game in person when they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup last Saturday, and it was the same level of performance when they played the same opposition on Friday. When you look at Brighton, they are a pass, pass, pass team. He's the one who looks up and is a bit brave. He's not afraid to give the ball away.\nGabriel (Arsenal) and John Stones (Manchester City): Both needed to have big performances for their teams in terms of keeping on with what they're trying to do. Arsenal are trying to win the league and Man City are trying to close the gap and stop this awful run, but with Stones back in the last couple of games they have looked miles better. Gabriel is now getting marked ridiculously closely from set pieces but is still able to get away and cause trouble, but defensively he was very good as well.\nMikel Merino (Arsenal): Merino shouldn't really get in my team of the week, but to come on and have the impact he had on that game at Leicester was absolutely massive. So I'm kind of breaking my own rule and giving a sub a place in my team.\nRyan Christie (Bournemouth): Southampton are poor but he was excellent against them - the energy and ability for the cross for the assist, and then the goal was a lovely touch and he whipped it into the far corner.\nKaoru Mitoma (Brighton): He is in it for one of the best touches I think I've ever seen. That is it, I don't care if there are other wingers that fans want to put in, that touch alone gets you in team of the week. It was an unbelievable touch and then to have the calmness to finish was excellent.\nYankuba Minteh (Brighton): He got two goals, was excellent, and was a thorn in the side of Chelsea all day. Newcastle obviously didn't want to get rid of him and you can see why. His potential with his pace and power is frightening.\nOmar Marmoush (Manchester City): I have said since he joined Man City he would be a good player, and we're starting to see now that he's going to be an exceptional player for Man City. He has what Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva have in terms of their link-up play. He is so quick and can glide past people. He can also finish. Three goals in 14 minutes gets you in team of the week.\nChris Wood (Nottingham Forest): Big Chris Wood just continues to score. He scores goals when he has no right to score.\nBeto (Everton): He had half a good season at Udinese, which is obviously why Everton bought him, but he struggled to get involved under Sean Dyche. Since David Moyes has been in, he has been excellent. He has been a whole different player. Another goal, fitter, stronger, braver.\nAnge Postecoglou (Tottenham): It was a huge game for him against Manchester United, and they had to win it.\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola suggested Manchester City have a \"1%\" chance of qualifying\nPep Guardiola strode into the Bernabeu Stadium's palatial surroundings knowing Manchester City must overturn the odds - and logic - in a special place that usually reserves its miracles for Real Madrid.\nHe has known every emotion in this legendary arena on a Champions League journey that has brought him here with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.\nAnd on Wednesday, Guardiola will once more appear alongside his friend and great adversary, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti, beneath those towering stands knowing victory will rank among his finest achievements.\nGuardiola rates City's chances of overturning a 3-2 deficit from the first leg of this play-off to reach the last 16 as \"1%\".\nAnd, to gauge the opinions of locals in a city that has held more Champions League victory parades than any other, they feel Guardiola is erring on the side of optimism.\nGuardiola was in measured mood when he appeared in front of the media at the Bernabeu, an environment that represented enemy territory during his time as  player and coach with Barcelona - and his message was crystal clear.\n\"We have to make it almost the perfect game,\" he said. \"We have to attack. We have to score goals. This is the idea.\"\nGuardiola is determined City will not leave the Bernabeu wondering or with regrets, saying: \"We must play with courage. We must be ourselves. It will need incredible courage and we must play to win.\n\"We could still lose, but we have to show that courage and be ourselves. We have to play so well, especially after the result we took away in the first leg.\"\nOpta statistics rate City's chances of advancing at a more optimistic 19.8%, but those percentages must be viewed through the prism of Real's history in this tournament and the muscle memory that kicks in for the 15-time winners when it matters.\nGuardiola's record with City against Real is chequered, though it started with victory in the last 16 in 2020, the two legs being played six months apart because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe most bitter moment came two years later when City led by two goals on aggregate in the 90th minute of the semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu, only for Rodrygo to score twice within seconds, Karim Benzema's injury-time penalty sending Real on to eventual victory over Liverpool in the final in Paris.\nWhen Guardiola, as Manchester City manager, claimed his third Champions League crown in 2023, after winning with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Real were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the Spanish champions then prevailing on penalties last season.\nHe said: \"I have some incredible memories here - sometimes good ones, sometimes not so good. \n\"We know at this stage, and in this stadium, the pressure is there - but you get that in Milan, in Barcelona, at Anfield. You have to suffer at these places, but you have to reduce those moments.\"\nReal's remarkable win against City in 2022 is the sort of sporting lightning strike Guardiola will seek to turn back on them, but he must do it with a fading team that has lost its domestic supremacy after winning a historic four successive Premier Leagues, and now faces the prospect of going out of the Champions League before the last 16 for the first time in 12 years.\nCarlo Ancelotti (left) and Pep Guardiola will be meeting in the Champions League for the 10th time\nThe wily Ancelotti was not taking Guardiola's bait about percentages when he spoke in Madrid on Tuesday, saying: \"He doesn't really think that. We don't think we have a 99% chance. We have a small advantage - and we have to take advantage of that.\"\nGuardiola responded: \"For the first time he didn't believe me. I always say what I think, and this time you don't believe me.\"\nStatistics pile up like giant obstacles in front of City's route to the last 16, explaining why Real are overwhelming favourites after two goals in a late surge gave them victory at Etihad Stadium.\nIt was the 40th time Real have won the first leg of a European knockout-stage tie away from home, progressing on 37 of the previous 39 occasions.\nCity's defeat, meanwhile, was the fifth time they have lost the first leg of a Champions League knockout-stage tie, going on to be eliminated on the previous four occasions.\nFor Ancelotti, this tournament's greatest coach with five wins, he will be meeting Guardiola in the Champions League for the 10th time, on eight occasions with Real against City. The Italian has won four of their nine meetings, never losing at home, winning two games and drawing two.\nOf more recent significance is that to unseat the holders, City will have to alter poor form in the competition after losing their past three away games to Sporting, Juventus and Paris St-Germain.\nGuardiola's spirits will be lifted by Saturday's 4-0 win over Newcastle United which included a hat-trick inside 14 first-half minutes for new Egyptian signing Omar Marmoush, while Erling Haaland demonstrated his quality with both goals in the first-leg defeat, his first against Real Madrid.\nHaaland has been prolific in the Champions League, scoring 49 goals in 48 games. If he scores at the Bernabeu, he will become the fastest player to 50 goals in appearances and age, at 24 years and 213 days.\nIt could even be a Champions League farewell to Manchester City for modern greats of the club such as Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and goalkeeper Ederson, while others such as Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic are also in their 30s.\nGuardiola would not be drawn as he said: \"I would like to answer this but it will be at the end of the season. We still have a lot to play for, to qualify for the Champions League next season, we are still there in the Champions League this season. We have the FA Cup and the Club World Cup.\"\nSilva added: \"If you had told me at the start of the season that we would be in this position in the Champions League and the Premier League I wouldn't have believed you. We deserve to be in this complicated situation because of where we finished.\n\"We have to believe. We still believe things can go our way, but this season is certainly a lesson for the future.\"\nFor Manchester City, that future is now - in the forbidding, unforgiving surroundings of the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nAnd if Guardiola can overcome those \"1%\" odds in this footballing cathedral, it will rank alongside the best results of his career.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The BBC looks into the psychology behind travel souvenirs: why we buy them, their impact on local communities and the planet, and how we can shop more thoughtfully.\nOn a recent backpacking trip through the Himalayas, my bruises became the truest souvenirs. Three months later, many of the contusions remain \u2013 stubborn scars with no intention of fading. More personal than anything I could have bought, they carry a backstory only I can tell, and I know exactly where they came from, with no hidden costs to the planet or people. Perhaps that's why, over time, my desire for typical souvenirs has faded. I now value experiences over objects \u2013 looking for meaning in what I bring back rather than just another trinket.\nBut maybe that's just me. Two out of three Americans bring back a souvenir from their travels, with US sales topping $21bn\u00a0(\u00a316.7bn) in 2022. The souvenir industry has drawn criticism for its reliance on mass production and cultural appropriation. Still, it remains to be an often-overlooked side of tourism's impact. Frequent flyers face scrutiny, but trinket collectors rarely do. Innovative ways to preserve memories remain largely unrealised. And when a friend hands me a fridge magnet stamped with their latest destination, I cringe. What does it really mean to take home a piece of a place, and at what cost?\nHumans have always had a penchant for collecting things. The Romans brought home spices, animal skins and rare artefacts to commemorate their travels and conquests. In the 18th Century, iconic locations like the Rome's Colosseum and Stonehenge in England were plundered by souvenir-seekers.\nWith the rise of industralisation and capitalism, a lot changed: the world became more connected, tourism boomed and profits took centre stage. But the human need to remember stayed. \"Looking at a souvenir can bring back happy emotions as the brain links it to positive experiences,\" said Vaishnavi Madarkal, a psychologist and therapist based in India. \"This connection can happen with anything \u2013 [whether it's] an object, music or a smell.\"\nThe word \"souvenir\" comes from French, meaning \"memory\" or \"remembrance\". But the allure of souvenirs goes beyond memories. According to Madarkal, often it's the dopamine rush of retail therapy or cultural gift-giving norms. Take Japan's omiyage tradition, where travellers bring back small edible gifts for friends, family and co-workers. I, too, have picked up presents like saffron and piment\u00f3n in Spain or seaweed chips in Thailand, wanting to share my travels with loved ones.\nFor many, souvenirs go beyond tangible reminders and material gifts \u2013 they satisfy a deeper need to say, \"I was there!\" \"At the core of our actions is a desire to feel heard, seen and validated,\" explains Madarkal. \"The same holds for why we may buy souvenirs.\"\nTHOUGHTFUL TRAVEL\nWant to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\nBut how does this fit into a world already overwhelmed by excess? \"The era of innocent tourism \u2013 where it was seen as a benign and universally positive force \u2013 ended around 2015,\" says Justin Francis, co-founder of Responsible Travel, a UK-based travel agency specialising in ethical tourism. \"In Europe and America, protests against overtourism are growing. People are realising their vacations can leave lasting impacts on others' homes.\"\nYet, while travellers today are more aware of their impact, souvenirs have been somewhat left behind. With 25 years in the travel industry, Francis offers a macro perspective. \"Though we haven't fully shifted yet, things have changed,\" he said. \"I've often witnessed travellers examine products, and ask, 'Where did this come from?'\"\nIn a world flooded with mass-produced items and fake markets, this question is crucial. A 2022 report by the Australian Government's Productivity Commission found that up to 75% of souvenirs marketed as \"Indigenous\" in Australia were counterfeit, with boomerangs and didgeridoos traced to Indonesia. Meanwhile, more than 70% of Thailand's popular elephant pants are made overseas. The battle of pashmina shawl artisans against cheaper, mass-produced alternatives is also well known.\n\"In the Leh market [in Kashmir, India], about 95% of fabrics sold as pashmina aren't genuine,\" says Sonam Angmo, co-founder of Lena Ladakh Pashmina, a slow textile brand focused on preserving the pashmina legacy while supporting local artisans. \"[The fake fabric] is mass-produced in places like Ludhiana and Punjab then brought to Ladakh by outsiders.\"\nA genuine pashmina shawl can cost upwards of 30,000 rupees (\u00a3280) due to the effort of raising goats in harsh climates and handcrafting the shawls. But for many travellers, this price is out of reach. As a result, some shops sell imitation shawls for 3,000-5,000 rupees (\u00a327.4-\u00a345.7), with most customers simply seeking a pashmina \"bought in Ladakh\" and giving little regard to its origins.\nThe high cost of genuine pashmina has driven demand for counterfeits, with the profitability of fake or \"semi-pashmina\" ensuring a steady supply. Angmo aptly calls this a \"vicious cycle\" that impacts local communities dependent on tourism. Frustrated by the difficulty of selling authentic items, some artisans resort to purchasing fake fabrics or working with mechanised looms. \"It's how they feed their families,\" Angmo explains. This may create a dilemma for shoppers: while purchasing counterfeit goods might seem to support local retailers, the true cost is often borne by artisans who rely on time-honoured craftsmanship.\nOne thing is clear: the desire to immortalise our travels isn't going anywhere. What's more, many communities, like those around busy tourist sites like Angkor Wat in Cambodia or Petra in Jordan, have thrived by turning souvenirs into a source of livelihood. Perhaps it's not about avoiding souvenirs entirely, but about making responsible choices.\nIt used to be easier to spot genuine local souvenirs. In places like Fez, Morocco, travellers could expect every leather good in the medina's souks to come from the city's iconic tanneries. But today's knockoffs are so sophisticated that even experts may struggle to distinguish them.\nBesides, most souvenirs are small, portable and affordable \u2013 qualities that make them appealing. This explains why many of the world's most popular souvenirs fit this mould. Meanwhile, sellers are more aware of consumer mindfulness, often marketing items as \"handcrafted\" or \"recycled\", though the truth can be far from the label. When so many forces are at play, even the best intentions to be mindful and responsible can become difficult to uphold.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 The new museum trend helping us regain our lost attention\n\u2022\u00a0 How will air pollution change where and when we travel?\n\u2022\u00a0 What makes a tourist attraction?\nSo, how can you buy souvenirs that are ethical, sustainable and meaningful? Sonam and Francis both agree: ask questions. \"Be curious\u2026 it's not just about buying or choosing carefully, it's about rejecting and explaining why,\" said Francis. \"You could say, 'This sculpture is beautiful, but I'm concerned about its environmental impact.'\"\nSrishti Tehri, a mindful traveller and content creator, emphasises being patient when souvenir hunting. She loves magnets for their daily visibility, but not just any magnet. \"I try to find the most interesting ones and put them on my wall of fame \u2013 my fridge,\" she says. \"I go the extra mile for unique designs or to support an artist. The generic ones are mostly ugly and feel like a scam.\" I agree. My rule: if every shop carries the same design, it's likely mass-produced.\nAnother way to ethically shop is to support reputable cooperatives and fair-trade markets. For instance, Women in Hebron features embroidered products and handicrafts by Palestinian women. Bangkok's Artist House, a centuries-old Thai wooden home, sells live portraits and wooden Muay Thai figurines and even offers opportunities to create your own souvenir.\nMany countries now certify authentic local goods, too. In India, genuine pashmina shawls bear GI (Geographical Indication) tags; Australia uses the black-and-red Indigenous Art Code logo; and the S\u00e1mi Doudji label in Nordic countries guarantees items are made by S\u00e1mi artisans.\nIntentions also matter. I no longer buy souvenirs on every trip \u2013 for myself or others. When I do, I ensure they're meaningful. Sometimes, I even ask friends what they want instead of guessing. Tehri echoes this: \"I never buy the same thing for everyone. My love language shifts \u2013 some prefer something utilitarian; others love collectables.\"\nA good souvenir doesn't always have to be bought or tangible. When you think beyond \"souvenirs\" and more about what sparks memories, the possibilities get exciting. Maybe it's a letter sent from your destination, a well-kept travel journal, or even something salvaged \u2013 like beer caps or ticket stubs. Some travellers capture the sounds of their adventures while others take home tattoos. Join a cooking class, and you can take home a souvenir that keeps giving \u2013 new culinary skills.\nUltimately, there's no universal rule for what makes a \"responsible\" souvenir; it's a personal decision we each make. But next time you're grabbing a quick airport trinket or ticking off your gift list, pause and reflect.\n\"We live in a world of faceless transactions,\" says Francis. \"If you think back to the Silk Road, trade was personal. You met the seller, exchanged something of value and that made the trade meaningful.\" Souvenirs, he believes, offer a chance to reclaim that intimacy. By buying directly from the maker, witnessing their craft and cutting out middlemen, you experience what Francis calls \"the purest form of commerce\".\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

Here are some of the highlights:\nWoman of the moment Sabrina Carpenter kicked off the show by performing a duet alongside Paul Simon of folk rock duo Simon and Garfunkel. The pair sang a rendition of the band's 1966 hit Homeward Bound.\nSimon first appeared on the comedy series back in 1976, singing the same song with The Beatles' George Harrison.\nEspresso singer Carpenter joked that neither she nor her parents had been born then.\nNirvana returned to the stage with surprise guest Post Malone - introduced by actor Adam Sandler. The actor reminisced about the original bandmates' last SNL performance with frontman Kurt Cobain shortly before his death.\nPost Malone joined Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear to play the band's iconic hit Smells Like Teen Spirit.\nIt came after the surviving members of the 90s rock band reunited for another special performance last month to raise money for the LA fires relief fund.\nSNL's jokes regularly centre around politics or news events, so it seemed unlikely that one of the most high-profile current celebrity showdowns - between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively - would be spared.\nThe It Ends With Us stars are currently embroiled in a bitter legal dispute, with a court date set for 2026.\nIn what appeared to be a reference to the drama, Lively's husband (who is also named in the complaint) Ryan Reynolds was part of a Q&A in which Tina Fey and Amy Poehler appeared on stage to take questions from the audience.\nAsked how he was doing, Reynolds replied \"Great!\" Then, seeming concerned, he asked: \"Why, what have you heard?\"\nUS actress Aubrey Plaza made one of her first public appearances since the death of her husband.\nDirector and screenwriter Jeff Baena died in January at the age of 47. The pair had been together for more than a decade and married in 2021.\nOn Sunday, Plaza popped up in the audience to introduce Miley Cyrus and Brittany Howard for a performance of Sinead O'Connor's Nothing Compares 2 U. \nShe paid tribute to Baena wearing a tie-dye shirt - it is unclear if it belonged to him but the couple wore tie-dye outfits for their wedding after the director got into the hobby during Covid.\nAn almost unrecognisable Meryl Streep made her SNL debut in a sketch hitting on Pedro Pascal and calling her character a \"bad girl\".\nShe also referenced her iconic film in which she played fierce fashion boss Miranda Priestly, joking: \"This devil wears nada.\"\nWhat would this special be without a face from the very first season of the show? It was fitting for Garrett Morris, an original cast member and the first black person on set of Saturday Night Live, to return to the studio.\nHe started the sketch declaring \"I am Garrett Morris\" to a big cheer, and joked that back when he joined the cast he had \"no idea ya'll that I would be required to do so many reunion shows\".\nDomingo was back. There was no surprise that arguably the most viral character of the last season would return for this special.\nPreviously, we saw him at the wedding of Kelsey and Matt, when her bridesmaids revealed in a musical ensemble that she had been having an affair with Domingo.\nOn the anniversary special, Domingo's brothers turned up at the couple's vow renewal. Santiago, aka musician Bad Bunny, and Reynaldo, played by Pedro Pascal, joined in when the groomsmen formed their own ensemble.\nIt was revealed, this time round, that Matt and Santiago had got to know one another.\nThe last time Kim Kardashian was on SNL, she made headlines for kissing comedian Pete Davidson on Aladdin's magic carpet - a kiss that was rumoured to be the start of their relationship.\nOn Sunday, Kardashian returned for an updated version of the singing Maharelle Sisters with former cast members Ana Gasteyer, Kristen Wiig and Scarlett Johansson - whose husband is the regular \"Weekend Update\" anchor Colin Jost.\nIntroduced by his rarely seen Anger Management co-star Jack Nicholson, actor Adam Sandler sang about the show's history. \nHe gave a long list of previous cast members, noting several who had died including veteran SNL-ers Chris Farley and Norm MacDonald along with Gilda Radner, Jan Hooks and Phil Hartman.\nTom Hanks, wearing a black suit and tie, aptly performed a spoof segment named \"In Memoriam\".\nHe introduced a tribute to \"SNL characters and sketches that have aged horribly\", describing the subsequent montage as \"unquestionably in poor taste\".\nHe pointed out to the audience in spite of that: \"You all laughed at them.

        "article_text": "US black nationalist leader Malcolm X was assassinated on 21 February 1965, at the age of 39. The BBC reported on the reaction in his adopted home of Harlem, New York, as thousands of people queued to pay their last respects.\nAt a time when black civil rights leaders were preaching peaceful integration, Malcolm X's uncompromising vision of black separatism inspired many people, while terrifying others. He was murdered in February 1965, and a reporter for the BBC's Panorama, Michael Charlton, stated at his funeral that he \"spoke a vengeful message, as forthright and chilled as the winter morning they buried him\". Amid tight security, the many thousands of people who had filed past his body were searched by police as a precaution against bombings. \"To these people, he preached that if the white man didn't answer for the black man's frustration, he must answer for his fury,\" added Charlton.\nHe was internationally famous for his incendiary rhetoric, yet he had been developing a new, more moderate worldview. Asked what the death of Malcolm X meant to him by Panorama, one clearly upset man who was in the queue said: \"It's a blow to every black person in the United States of America.\" A young man described him as a hero, saying: \"He stood out among all black people. He showed the white man where it was at.\" This interviewee was one of several people who feared that more violence would follow. \"Whoever did it, Muslims or whoever did it, there's going to be a whole lot of hurt,\" he predicted. One young woman said: \"I don't believe it. Why would they kill another black man?\" Another woman had no doubt who was responsible: \"The white power structure in America is behind it. They quickly capitalised on it by saying that one of his own kind did it, but they put it up to be done. They know they had more to gain by getting Malcolm X out of the way than they had to let him live.\"\nMalcolm X was shot dead on stage at a New York ballroom as he prepared to deliver a speech to his Organization of Afro-American Unity. His wife and children were in the audience. Three men convicted of his murder were all members of the Nation of Islam, the political and religious body that, a year earlier, Malcolm X had left amid acrimony. One of the men was caught while attempting to flee, and confessed to the murder, but the other two convictions resulted in a long-running miscarriage of justice campaign. In 2021, a New York state judge agreed, and their convictions were quashed. Both men were later fully exonerated after New York's attorney general found prosecutors had withheld evidence that, in all likelihood, would have cleared them of blame for the murder.\nStill a controversial figure 60 years after his death, Malcolm\u00a0X remains to some the ultimate symbol of rage and resistance in the face of oppression. Born Malcolm Little in 1925 in Omaha, Nebraska, he was the son of a Baptist preacher. When\u00a0Malcolm\u00a0was six years old, his father was killed in what many believe was a deliberate racist attack by white supremacists, although nobody knows for sure if this was the case. The shock of his father being killed led his mother to have a mental breakdown, and Malcolm and his seven siblings were shipped out to foster homes. He fell into a life of crime, and in 1946 he was jailed for burglary. While in prison, he discovered a love of learning and self-improvement. There, he encountered the ideas of the Nation of Islam, a political and religious body that argued that equality for black Americans could only be achieved through black and white people living in separate states.\u00a0\nUpon his release from prison in 1952, he formally changed his name to Malcolm X. It was a firm rejection of the surname that had been given to his family by the people who, generations earlier, had enslaved them. He toured the US, spreading the Nation of Islam's message, and discovered that he had the power and charisma to inspire people with his words. Public speaking was a skill he had learnt, having entered prison as a middle-school dropout who, he admitted, \"didn't know a verb from a house\". He was not afraid to use shock tactics to get his message across, condemning white people as the \"white devil\" for the historic oppression of black people.\u00a0When US President John F Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, he said it was \"chickens coming home to roost\".\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.

In March 1964 he announced that he was leaving the Nation of Islam, having become disillusioned with its leadership. That same month, he witnessed a debate in Washington DC about the Civil Rights Bill, and he finally met Martin Luther King, Jr, a civil rights leader whose belief in nonviolent protest was often seen as being in stark contrast with Malcolm X's more confrontational philosophy.\u00a0\nTo deepen his Muslim faith, he went on the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. He wrote about how he witnessed \"pilgrims of all colours from all parts of this Earth displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood like I've never seen before\". He also toured several countries in Africa, where he made the decision to form a new secular group that sought to reconnect African Americans with their heritage. Upon his return to the US, he renounced the teachings of the Nation of Islam. Around that time, Malcolm X's wife Betty Shabazz began receiving death threats over the phone, and their home was firebombed.\u00a0\nDespite apparent threats coming from many directions, he continued making his electrifying public appearances. In June 1964, he officially launched his Organization of Afro-American Unity, telling the gathered audience: \"We want freedom by any means necessary. We want justice by any means necessary. We want equality by any means necessary.\" The venue was the Audubon Ballroom in New York's Washington Heights neighbourhood; eight months later he was murdered on that same stage.\nAs mourners continued to file past Malcolm X's body in a Harlem funeral home, Charlton asked several prominent people about what sort of leader he might have become. Malcolm X had become a regular visitor to the United Nations headquarters in New York, according to Daniel Watts, the editor of black nationalist magazine The Liberator. Watts said that he had been highlighting discrimination against black people in the US to members of the Afro-Asian bloc. \"I think for the first time in the history of the struggle here in this country, we had a molecule of hope \u2013 hope in the sense in knowing that we had a heritage, we had roots, we had a motherland to which we could look for,\" he said.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Martin Luther King, Jr, a misunderstood icon of US history\n\u2022\u00a0The day Nelson Mandela walked out of prison a free man\n\u2022\u00a0Nina Simone on how racial injustice fuelled her songs\nJames Farmer, director of the Congress of Racial Equality, told Panorama that while Malcolm X had not been a part of the civil rights movement, his \"more extreme stance\" had boosted its position. He said: \"The public saw very clearly that unless they did what the civil rights movement demanded, they might get Malcolm X. In fact, Malcolm said just that to me once after a debate we had. He said, 'You know you ought to stop pushing us around like this.' I asked why. He said, 'Because we help you. We make a lot of noise, people look at us and scream bloody murder, and then turn to you.'\" Farmer said that Malcolm X had been successful in giving younger black people a sense of identity. \"It has been very important because a person cannot have a sense of destiny for the future unless he believes he is somebody first.\"\nFarmer also said that Malcolm X had been trying to broaden his appeal since his split with the Nation of Islam. \"I feel that his position was in a state of flux, and that he was moving closer toward an integrationist and desegregationist position. He was over at my house just six weeks before he died, and there I asked him if his views had changed on racial issues and he indicated it was true, he was giving up black racism. Now he was prepared, he told me, to accept a man on the basis of his deeds rather than his genes. This was a switch.\"\nPoet Maya Angelou was a friend of Malcolm X who had reconnected with him during his Africa trip when he visited Ghana, where she was living at the time. Speaking in 1992, she told the BBC: \"He came to Ghana and said, 'I have found blue-eyed men who I'm able to call brother, so my prior statement that all whites were devils is erroneous.' It takes an incredible amount of courage to be able to say, 'Say everybody, you remember what I said yesterday? I've found out that's wrong.' And that's what he was able to do. That was amazing.\"\nCharlton concluded his Panorama report on Malcolm X's funeral by observing that he \"died too soon after his adoption of more moderate views for us to know what wider appeal he may have attracted\". He said the \"most arresting epitaph\" he heard that week came from a black person who said, \"I don't know how many followers he had, but he had a hell of a lot of well-wishers.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

But other than Haaland, who got four, no-one scored more.\nMarmoush hits quickfire treble as Man City thrash Newcastle\nOmar Marmoush had scored 20 goals in all competitions for Eintracht Frankfurt this term, when he joined Manchester City\nIt is that issue Guardiola was trying to address when he called contacts in Germany to check up on Marmoush after sporting director Txiki Begiristain had put the Egyptian's name forward as a part of City's overall \u00a3180m January transfer window spend.\n\"When Txiki came to me I said, because of the season we had, the more players you bring the better,\" said Guardiola.\n\"I called some contacts in Germany because I have friends there. I asked a few things and there was a high opinion in many things; behaviour, in training sessions, goals.\n\"He's young and comes here to make his career. That is why the club decides. They always have the last word.\"\nMarmoush had already demanded attention through the 20 goals he scored for Eintracht in the first half of this season.\nAt 26, City were buying someone approaching the prime of their career.\nOn the evidence of his performance against Newcastle, Marmoush drives forward with purpose when the ball is at his feet, is quick and can find space. \nEvidently he presents a danger opposition defences cannot ignore \u2013 and Newcastle could not contain.\nThat, in turn, may take some of the focus away from Haaland.\n\"Everything about his game was impressive,\" former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day. \n\"Already he has a good understanding with Haaland. Newcastle couldn't live with him.\"\n\"We knew with the dynamic he would be good,\" added Guardiola. \"In Germany he made good numbers and he had three chances last week against [Leyton] Orient but didn't score.\n\"He likes to attack the space. It is simple. When you play well, everybody adapts quick. Hopefully he can handle the biggest compliments because they will come now.\"\nIt was one of those rare occasions when Haaland didn't score and contributed a single assist, for James McAtee, six minutes from time.\nYet his industry was notable, leading from the front in a performance befitting his status as captain for the first time.\nNormally, Guardiola stays out of the captaincy issue, preferring to let the players decide on the leadership group.\nHowever, with club skipper Kyle Walker now at AC Milan, others who have done the job previously, Kevin de Bruyne and Bernardo, on the bench and Ilkay Gundogan overlooked for the role since his return from Barcelona in the summer, Guardiola stepped in to make sure Haaland - who last month signed a new deal that runs to 2034 - took the role.\n\"When Kyle left, Kevin became the first but I nominated Erling, not them,\" said the City boss.\n\"When a player is going to be here 10 years, sooner or later, you need to take the responsibility. He did it for the first time.\"\nGuardiola also played down the injury Haaland appeared to suffer in the final minutes.\nThe Norway international initially sat down and flexed his leg before the physios came on. It was immediately decided to take him off.\nHowever, Haaland watched the remainder of the game from the bench and went back on to the pitch to shake hands with opposition players after the final whistle.\n\"When he went down, everyone was scared,\" added Guardiola.\n\"But he got up and walked away smiling as always.

        "article_text": "Pep Guardiola describes him as a 'mini-Rodri' but could Nico Gonzalez end up having a huge impact on what is left of Manchester City's season?\nThe \u00a350m midfielder's impressive display on his Premier League debut, Saturday's 4-0 win over top-four rivals Newcastle, brought the Rodri comparison from his beaming manager and impressed former City defender Micah Richards, who analysed Gonzalez for MOTD2.\n\"Gonzalez gave City the control they have been missing, with and without the ball,\" said Richards.\n\"That made a massive difference to the whole team, and he was a positive influence on the players around him too.\"\nNext up is an even tougher test, but could the 23-year-old Spaniard have a similar effect against Real Madrid on Wednesday, and help City turn around a Champions League play-off tie where they trail 3-2 after the first leg?\n\"The balance of the team looks much, much better already with Gonzalez in it,\" Richards added.\n\"City have got players who can score goals and hurt Real, but he brings some stability behind them, which they will need if they are to manage the game in Madrid.\n\"Do they have more chance of beating Real with him in the starting XI? Without a doubt.\"\nGonzalez made his Premier League debut against Newcastle. He may have been described as being a 'mini-Rodri' but at 6ft 2in he is only one inch shorter than his new City team-mate\nOne of the re-occurring themes of City's calamitous campaign is how often they have been cut open on the counter-attack since Rodri was injured in September.\nGuardiola has tried plenty of other players in the number six role, without replacing Rodri's calm authority in the heart of midfield, which was a hallmark of his team and helped them win trophy after trophy.\nAgainst Newcastle, it was different. City often stopped breakaways early, in the opposition half, with Gonzalez - a former Barcelona trainee who arrived at Etihad Stadium from Porto at the end of the January transfer window - seeing the threat early and expertly pouncing to snuff it out.\nThis video can not be played\nGonzales was 'our mini-Rodri' during big Man City win - Guardiola\n\"I saw a couple of situations against Newcastle where, in previous games, City would have been in big trouble,\" Richards explained.\n\"In the past, they were playing the ball forward to the edge of the opposition box, losing it, then someone in midfield would get turned and suddenly the defence was having to drop back rapidly from the halfway line because the opposition were running through unchallenged.\n\"That did not happen on Gonzalez's watch because he did not just stop counter-attacks when they happened, he anticipated the danger so they never happened in the first place.\n\"In one of the clips I picked out for MOTD2, he starts sprinting forward to pick up the second ball before the Newcastle defender on the edge of their area has even headed clear.\n\"Gonzalez is not just sitting deep, waiting, instead he gets up the pitch and into the right position to stop a group of Newcastle players getting on the ball and springing a break.\nCity play a high ball up to Phil Foden but it is about to be headed away, beyond Foden and Erling Haaland who is stood by the referee. Gonzalez (highlighted) has already started running to where he thinks the ball will go...\n... Gonzalez is right, and he collects the ball before three Newcastle players can react and quickly feeds it to Josko Gvardiol (number 24) to his left\n\"That was not the only time he made a difference defensively.\n\"There was another clip I chose from the Newcastle game which was a mirror image of how City conceded their second goal against Juventus in their Champions League defeat in Turin in December.\n\"A City attack had just broken down and Ilkay Gundogan, who was playing as the deepest midfielder, got pulled across to the right, leaving a big hole in the middle for Juve to drive through, with only the defence to deal with it.\nAgainst Juve, Gundogan was drawn over to cover behind Kyle Walker (number 2) who is the City player nearest the ball on the right...\n... but Juve quickly switched the ball into the space inside, and drove forward. Rico Lewis has come inside from the left, leaving space on his flank - where the cross for Juve's second goal comes from\n\"This time, however, Gonzalez leaves the runner to his left and he is not worried about him. Instead he reads the play and - bam! - he goes straight in for the challenge in the centre of the pitch to stop the counter. \n\"It's perfect midfield play, because he does not jump too early either. His timing is excellent, and he gets the ball back, with energy and purpose.\"\nAgainst Newcastle, Gonzalez leaves his man, who is running out to the right and switches his attention to the Newcastle players in the centre...\n... this time, when Newcastle play the ball inside, there is no gap for them to run through. Gonzalez reads the danger and is across to engage and win the ball back for City \nGonzalez was forced off injured on his City debut, last week's FA Cup win at Leyton Orient. He was hurt when he was caught on the ball, seconds before Jamie Donley's stunning long-range strike, which cannoned off the bar and went in via Stefan Ortega, put the home side ahead.\nOn Saturday, he lasted the full match, topping the ranking from both teams for most touches [114] and passes [103], with a 97% success rate.\nGonzalez attempted 103 passes against Newcastle, and completed 100 of them. He played 15 passes into the final third, more than any other player\nHis careful use of the ball helped give City the control of possession that Guardiola craves - they enjoyed 62% of it against the Magpies - but he was brave with his distribution too.\n\"There were times when Gonzalez took out three or four Newcastle players with one pass forward,\" Richards added. \"That's another thing City have been missing when they are starting attacks, or facing packed defences, someone who can break the lines from deep like that.\n\"Most of the time, though, you might have looked at his passing and think well he is actually not doing anything special. He was just in the right position, recycling the ball and keeping things moving.\n\"Again, though, that's exactly what City have needed this season, because there have been too many games where they have not starved the opposition of the ball the way they would in the past.\n\"I loved how Gonzalez has got the personality to come to the Premier League and play like this, straight away, against a team renowned for their physicality and intensity in midfield.\n\"As well as character, he also had the intelligence to know when to take a chance, and when to just hold on to the ball. Having someone with that kind of football IQ in your team is priceless.\"\nIt was striking to see exactly where Gonzalez got on the ball, with none of his touches taking place in the final third of the pitch.\nFor Richards, that was further evidence that he was constantly thinking about his role in the side, and also showed how he might think differently to Mateo Kovacic and Ilkay Gundogan, who have both filled in for Rodri as a defensive midfielder but had to wrestle with their attacking instincts.\n\"I think Gonzalez can get forward and into the box if he wants to,\" Richards added. \"Rodri always did that too - he scored nine goals last season.\n\"But on Saturday he wasn't worried about getting forward, he was just thinking about what was best for the team - looking at where the space was and filling the gaps at the right moments in midfield, whether City had the ball or not.\n\"That was great for his team-mates, because they knew they had him giving that protection behind them, and it particularly benefited Rico Lewis.\n\"Without Rodri alongside him, Rico has often seemed like he is stuck between a rock and a hard place. While his form has not been at the level we saw when he first broke into the team, he has found the role that Pep asks him to perform much more difficult this season.\n\"When City play with four at the back and Lewis is right-back, he is asked to come inside to create an overload in midfield.\nGraphic showing the average position of touches by each Manchester City player against Newcastle on Saturday. Nico Gonzales is number 14 and Rico Lewis is number 82\n\"Without Rodri, and before Gonzalez signed, Lewis was coming into midfield too early, and getting stuck in those central areas. Against Newcastle, however, he had Gonzalez behind him and it allowed him to get forward quicker, and give City more options out wide on the right.\n\"On top of that, Gonzalez helped Lewis defensively too, although City's dominance against Newcastle meant this was not as easy to spot.\n\"Lewis is still a defender, first and foremost, so when City have been losing the ball in the areas I spoke about earlier, he has to decide whether to get back in his right-back slot, or stay in midfield.\n\"It actually happened on the opposite flank for the Juventus goal I mentioned earlier, when he was at left-back but came across into midfield and left space out wide. With Rodri there, he does not have to come inside when attacks break down, and the same applies with Gonzalez in the team too.\n\"I loved the way Gonzalez seemed aware of exactly where to be at all times, and he also had the legs to get there quickly when he had to.\n\"That energy and physicality is something else City have lacked in their midfield, and it is another reason he looks like a gem of a player, who was the perfect signing for Pep.\n\"Going forward, he's going to be an important player alongside Rodri, not just instead of him. \n\"He definitely gives City more hope against Madrid, too. They are not the favourites, but of course they still have a chance of getting through.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'First time I've played this position' - Merino scores twice on striker debut\nArsenal's failed search for a striker was looming large in manager Mikel Arteta's rear view mirror - until he discovered the answer might have been sitting right behind him at Leicester City.\nThe Gunners looked every inch a team without a recognised main forward as they laboured and spluttered to break down Leicester City's game but limited resistance at King Power Stadium.\nIt was then, after 69 minutes and with Arsenal's title pursuit losing momentum, Arteta put Raheem Sterling out of his misery and turned to Merino, the Spain midfield man signed from Real Sociedad for \u00a332.6m last August.\nArsenal started with Leandro Trossard as a false nine. This did not work and it was Merino's arrival and accomplished finishing with both goals in the 2-0 win, that has given Arteta very palatable food for thought and kept the Gunners firmly in the title hunt.\nWilliam Saliba offered himself up as a potential striker solution after Kai Havertz suffered a season-ending hamstring injury on Arsenal's sunshine break to Dubai, but this was not an option given his high-class quality in defence.\nArteta suggested another defender, Riccardo Calafiori, might be in the frame and the Italian has shown an eye for a goal - but Merino has made his case in Arsenal's state of emergency, scoring twice in a game for the first time since 2016.\nIt was a tactical switch that had a touch of desperation as well as improvisation, but Arteta and Merino must take the credit as Arsenal extended their unbeaten run to 15 games in the Premier League - 10 wins and five draws. It is their best run since going 16 games unbeaten between December 2010 and April 2011 under Arsene Wenger.\nA delighted Arteta said: \"Mikel has a sense of danger and great timing in the box. We were composed, scored two brilliant goals and could have scored one or two more.\nHe added: \"He has got a goal threat. He can smell danger. He can anticipate the action. He's got really good timing to arrive in certain areas and execute.\n\"We are going to have various contexts and we are prepared. We have to have the pictures in our heads for these scenarios. We have to see where the game is and what is demanded. In this game we believed it was him. The hardest thing then is to deliver and he did.\n\"I think the game started to suit him more because Leicester started to defend much deeper. We had more momentum, more sequences, more set-pieces as well in that period. And we believed that he could impact the game. We were lucky that he did it.\"\nMerino's late double keeps Arsenal title pursuit on track at Leicester\nSaturday's Premier League action and reaction\nThis video can not be played\nArteta's game changing sub  'You have to try things'\nThe 6ft 2in Merino's height and stature make him an obvious threat and so it proved. He stole in to head home powerfully from Ethan Nwaneri's right-wing cross with nine minutes left, before finishing with confidence after 87 minutes to wrap up the win that leaves Arsenal four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool having played a game more.\nThe player himself played down the notion he might figure more as a striker, but on this evidence Arteta may give him no say in the matter as he makes his plans without Havertz and Gabriel Jesus until next season.\nMerino said when asked about starting as a striker: \"I don't think so to be honest. It is certainly the first time I have scored two coming off the bench as a striker.\"\nHe told BBC Match Of The Day: \"It was big news for me this morning when one of the assistants told me this was an option. It's the first time in my career that I've played in this position, but the good thing is that the way this team plays, everyone knows what to do.\n\"Mikel told me to use my strengths in the box and I was in the right place at the right time. I've not trained there once but I know what everyone has to do on the pitch. Tactically, we are a rich team and I just tried to emulate all the guys who are out injured.\"\nIf Merino, justifiably, grabbed the headlines, it was 17-year-old Nwaneri who was Arsenal's overall inspiration with a superb performance of skill, confidence, pace and maturity.\nNwaneri delivered the inviting cross for Merino's opener, having previously hit the woodwork twice in Arsenal's only serious moments of threat before those late goals.\nArteta was lavish in his praise of Nwaneri, as well as his fellow teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, who ensured Arsenal stayed on level terms by applying a vital touch to Jordan Ayew's cross with Bobby de Cordova-Reid waiting to tap in a simple finish at the far post with the scoreline goalless.\nArsenal's nerves and anxiety were mounting until Merino stepped into the breach, the lack of a serious central threat obvious as every attempt floundered near goal with Leicester City holding firm.\nIn among that pre-Merino mediocrity, it was a dismal day for Sterling, who struggled to do a thing right and looked short of confidence and the old pace before Arteta decided he had seen enough.\nSterling looked crestfallen as he walked off, another opportunity missed for the 30-year-old former England forward to show he can still be a going concern at this level as he continues to struggle at Arsenal after being marginalised by Chelsea.\nNo such problems for Merino, who has not had a full effect in midfield since his Arsenal arrival but may now have the chance to do so further forward as Arteta looks to solve his most pressing problem.\nAnd there was a touch of belated romance about Merino's heroics and Arsenal's win as the Spain midfielder said: \"I forgot to give my wife something for Valentine's Day so this goes to her.

        "summary": "'He can smell danger' - is Merino Arsenal's striker solution?This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'First time I've played this position' - Merino scores twice on striker debutPhil McNultyChief football writer The King Power StadiumPublished1 hour ago159 CommentsArsenal's failed search for a striker was looming large in manager Mikel Arteta's rear view mirror - until he discovered the answer might have been sitting right behind him at Leicester City.The Gunners looked every inch a team without a recognised main forward as they laboured and spluttered to break down Leicester City's game but limited resistance at King Power Stadium.It was then, after 69 minutes and with Arsenal's title pursuit losing momentum, Arteta put Raheem Sterling out of his misery and turned to Merino, the Spain midfield man signed from Real Sociedad for \u00a332.6m last August.Arsenal started with Leandro Trossard as a false nine. This did not work and it was Merino's arrival and accomplished finishing with both goals in the 2-0 win, that has given Arteta very palatable food for thought and kept the Gunners firmly in the title hunt.William Saliba offered himself up as a potential striker solution after Kai Havertz suffered a season-ending hamstring injury on Arsenal's sunshine break to Dubai, but this was not an option given his high-class quality in defence.Arteta suggested another defender, Riccardo Calafiori, might be in the frame and the Italian has shown an eye for a goal - but Merino has made his case in Arsenal's state of emergency, scoring twice in a game for the first time since 2016.It was a tactical switch that had a touch of desperation as well as improvisation, but Arteta and Merino must take the credit as Arsenal extended their unbeaten run to 15 games in the Premier League - 10 wins and five draws. \"If Merino, justifiably, grabbed the headlines, it was 17-year-old Nwaneri who was Arsenal's overall inspiration with a superb performance of skill, confidence, pace and maturity.Nwaneri delivered the inviting cross for Merino's opener, having previously hit the woodwork twice in Arsenal's only serious moments of threat before those late goals.Arteta was lavish in his praise of Nwaneri, as well as his fellow teenager Myles Lewis-Skelly, who ensured Arsenal stayed on level terms by applying a vital touch to Jordan Ayew's cross with Bobby de Cordova-Reid waiting to tap in a simple finish at the far post with the scoreline goalless.Arsenal's nerves and anxiety were mounting until Merino stepped into the breach, the lack of a serious central threat obvious as every attempt floundered near goal with Leicester City holding firm.In among that pre-Merino mediocrity, it was a dismal day for Sterling, who struggled to do a thing right and looked short of confidence and the old pace before Arteta decided he had seen enough.Sterling looked crestfallen as he walked off, another opportunity missed for the 30-year-old former England forward to show he can still be a going concern at this level as he continues to struggle at Arsenal after being marginalised by Chelsea.No such problems for Merino, who has not had a full effect in midfield since his Arsenal arrival but may now have the chance to do so further forward as Arteta looks to solve his most pressing problem.And there was a touch of belated romance about Merino's heroics and Arsenal's win as the Spain midfielder said: \"I forgot to give my wife something for Valentine's Day so this goes to her. It's the first time in my career that I've played in this position, but the good thing is that the way this team plays, everyone knows what to do. And we believed that he could impact the game.",

Unless those have secretly changed,  they involve capitulation to Russia's demands and the permanent ceding of territory to Moscow.\nVance's speech came days after President Trump effectively pulled the rug out from Ukraine's negotiating position by conceding, via his Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, that restoring Ukraine's territory to where it was before the first Russian invasion in 2014 is simply \"not realistic\".\nThe US also dashed Kyiv's hopes of joining Nato, a key ambition of President Zelensky, and ruled out sending US troops to help protect Ukraine's borders from the next time Russia decides to invade.\nAhead of the Munich conference Europe was stunned by news that Trump had held an apparently cordial 90-minute phone call with Putin, thus abruptly ending the West's three-year freeze in talking to the Russian leader that has been in place since the time of the 2022 invasion.\nThe delegates in Munich are scheduled to focus on the war in Ukraine in a high-profile debate on Saturday.\nThe fear in Munich amongst European leaders and their delegations is that in Donald Trump's rush to secure a peace deal in Ukraine, Putin will emerge victorious, stronger and planning to seize more parcels of land in Europe.",
