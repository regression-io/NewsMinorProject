Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.\nThat indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.\nAnd it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster. \nThe crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.\nResolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.\n\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.\n\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.\nGraphics by Erwan Rivault",

        "article_text": "When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief.\nTen of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%.\nOnly Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days.\nThe exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US.\nCommentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers.\nWhile plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to.\nHere I'll set out this debate \u2013 starting with the potential upsides for the region.\nSouth America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.\nThe US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.\nFor example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US.\nThere is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports.\nWith the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat.\nThese include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group.\nHe tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was \"excellent for Brazilian agriculture\" as \"Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us\".\nHowever, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising \"bilateral barriers\" on commodities mostly just affects \"who sells to whom\", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally.\nSo his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers.\n\"The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors\u2026 for example if there is a recession,\" he tells the BBC.\nYet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US.\nTake the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports.\nJapan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America.\nOther Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market.\nBrazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.\nTrump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US.\nThis would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers.\nMeanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place. \nThe other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%.\nUruguay's new President Yamand\u00fa Orsi has also said that Trump's tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America's bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality.\nHe said that \"Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat\" in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners.\nYou may have noted a lot of \"coulds\" and \"ifs\". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability.\nWhether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent.\nFirstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium.\nThe US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%.\nBrazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  \u2013 bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry.\nArgentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers.\n\"We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,\" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald.\nTrump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export.\nEduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a \"serious headwind\" for South America.\nLooking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump.\nAfter all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries.\nMr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. \"If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil.\"\nHe theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America.\nSo, calling Trump's tariffs a clear \"win\" or \"loss\" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%.\nAs Mr Hallak says: \"It's very hard to predict where this is going.\"\nSubject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods.\nBut adds: \"I'm not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don't think so.\"\n",

        "article_text": "Will India be able to stop the Indus river and two of its tributaries from flowing into Pakistan?\nThat's the question on many minds, after India suspended a major treaty governing water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between the two countries, following Tuesday's horrific attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. \nThe 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) survived two wars between the nuclear rivals and was seen as an example of trans-boundary water management.\nThe suspension is among several steps India has taken against Pakistan, accusing it of backing cross-border terrorism -  a charge Islamabad flatly denies. It has also hit back with reciprocal measures against Delhi, and said stopping water flow \"will be considered as an Act of War\". \nThe treaty allocated the three eastern rivers \u2013 the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej \u2013 of the Indus basin to India, while 80% of the three western ones \u2013 the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab \u2013 to Pakistan.\nDisputes have flared in the past, with Pakistan objecting to some of India's hydropower and water infrastructure projects, arguing they would reduce river flows and violate the treaty. (More than 80% of Pakistan's agriculture and around a third of its hydropower depend on the Indus basin's water.)\nIndia, meanwhile, has been pushing to review and modify the treaty, citing changing needs - from irrigation and drinking water to hydropower - in light of factors like climate change.\nOver the years, Pakistan and India have pursued competing legal avenues under the treaty brokered by the World Bank.\nBut this is the first time either side has announced a suspension - and notably, it's the upstream country, India, giving it a geographic advantage.\nBut what does the suspension really mean? Could India hold back or divert the Indus basin's waters, depriving Pakistan of its lifeline? And is it even capable of doing so?\nExperts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back tens of billions of cubic metres of water from the western rivers during high-flow periods. It lacks both the massive storage infrastructure and the extensive canals needed to divert such volumes.\n\"The infrastructure India has are mostly run-of-the-river hydropower plants that do not need massive storage,\" said Himanshu Thakkar, a regional water resources expert with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.\nSuch hydropower plants use the force of running water to spin turbines and generate electricity, without holding back large volumes of water.\nIndian experts say inadequate infrastructure has kept India from fully utilising even its 20% share of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus waters under the treaty - a key reason they argue for building storage structures, which Pakistan opposes citing treaty provisions.\nExperts say India can now modify existing infrastructure or build new ones to hold back or divert more water without informing Pakistan.\n\"Unlike in the past, India will now not be required to share its project documents with Pakistan,\" said Mr Thakkar.\nBut challenges like difficult terrain and protests within India itself over some of its projects have meant that construction of water infrastructure in the Indus basin has not moved fast enough.\nAfter a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016, Indian water resources ministry officials had told the BBC they would speed up construction of several dams and water storage projects in the Indus basin.\nAlthough there is no official information on the status of such projects, sources say progress has been limited.\nSome experts say that if India begins controlling the flow with its existing and potential infrastructure, Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season, when water availability is already at its lowest.\n\"A more pressing concern is what happens in the dry season - when the flows across the basin are lower, storage matters more, and timing becomes more critical,\" Hassan F Khan, assistant professor of Urban Environmental Policy and Environmental Studies at Tufts University, wrote in the Dawn newspaper.\n\"That is where the absence of treaty constraints could start to be felt more acutely.\"\nThe treaty requires India to share hydrological data with Pakistan - crucial for flood forecasting and planning for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water.\nPradeep Kumar Saxena, India's former IWT commissioner for over six years, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the country can now stop sharing flood data with Pakistan.\nThe region sees damaging floods during the monsoon season, which begins in June and lasts until September. But Pakistani authorities have said India was already sharing very limited hydrological data.\n\"India was sharing only around 40% of the data even before it made the latest announcement,\" Shiraz Memon, Pakistan's former additional commissioner of the Indus Waters Treaty, told BBC Urdu.\nAnother issue that comes up each time there is water-related tension in the region is if the upstream country can \"weaponise\" water against the downstream country.\nThis is often called a \"water bomb\", where the upstream country can temporarily hold back water and then release it suddenly, without warning, causing massive damage downstream.\nCould India do that?\nExperts say India would first risk flooding its own territory as its dams are far from the Pakistan border. However, it could now flush silt from its reservoirs without prior warning - potentially causing damage downstream in Pakistan.\nHimalayan rivers like the Indus carry high silt levels, which quickly accumulate in dams and barrages. Sudden flushing of this silt can cause significant downstream damage.\nThere's a bigger picture: India is downstream of China in the Brahmaputra basin, and the Indus originates in Tibet.\nIn 2016, after India warned that \"blood and water cannot flow together\" following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which India blamed on Pakistan, China blocked a tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo - that becomes the Brahmaputra in northeast India.\nChina, that has Pakistan as its ally, said they had done it as it was needed for a hydropower project they were building near the border. But the timing of the move was seen as Beijing coming in to help Islamabad. \nAfter building several hydropower plants in Tibet, China has green-lit what will be the world's largest dam on the lower reaches of Yarlung Tsangpo.\nBeijing claims minimal environmental impact, but India fears it could give China significant control over the river's flow.",

        "article_text": "California's economy has overtaken that of the country of Japan, making the US state the fourth largest global economic force.\nGovernor Gavin Newsom touted new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis showing California's growth. \nThe data shows California's gross domestic product (GDP) hit $4.10 trillion (\u00a33.08 trillion) in 2024, surpassing Japan, which was marked at $4.01 trillion. The state now only trails Germany, China and the US as a whole.\n\"California isn't just keeping pace with the world - we're setting the pace,\" Newsom said.\nThe new figures come as Newsom has spoken out against President Donald Trump's tariffs and voiced concern about the future of the state's economy. \nCalifornia has the largest share of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US. It is also home to leading technological innovation, the centre of the world's entertainment industry and the country's two largest seaports. \nNewsom, a prominent Democrat and possible presidential candidate in 2028, filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's authority to impose the levies, which have caused disruption to global markets and trade. \nTrump has enacted 10% levies on almost all countries importing to the US, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. \nAnother 25% tariff was imposed on Mexico and Canada.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I loved being out there!' O'Sullivan charges into last 16\nRonnie O'Sullivan has said he was \"worried\" about returning to snooker, fearing he would \"implode\" and \"have a meltdown\" in his first competitive match since January.\nO'Sullivan, 49, beat Ali Carter 10-4 on Wednesday in the first round of the World Championship, a competition he has won seven times.\nHowever, his participation in the tournament was only confirmed late last week after he went three months without playing competitively following an incident at the Championship League in January in which he snapped his cue and threw it in a bin.\n\"I lost the buzz for playing because I wasn't able to execute shots,\" said O'Sullivan. \"I was bailing out of shots. I was having to play a different game that I didn't enjoy and it didn't feel like I could express myself, so it got really tough.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan has won the World Snooker Championship seven times and is aiming to become the first man in the modern era to gain eight titles\nAsked if there were times in the past week where he thought he had made a mistake about returning to snooker, O'Sullivan said: \"Yeah, totally. \n\"I thought 'what am I doing coming here, exposing myself, [potentially] imploding out there, having a meltdown?' All that went through my head. I told [sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters that and he said 'I'm coming - I will get you through the first match'.\n\"I was quite a bit scared coming and playing. It's a daunting venue to play at anyway but it's about getting on the bike again and playing and I'm really proud that I've done that.\n\"Even if I had lost, it didn't really matter. I made that breakthrough. There's still a lot of work to do.\"\nO'Sullivan scored 583 points in five frames on Wednesday, compared with just 43 for Ali Carter\nIn Tuesday's first session against two-time Crucible finalist Carter, neither player was at their best, with it seemingly finely balanced at 5-4 to O'Sullivan.\nBut on Wednesday, 'The Rocket' was in sensational form, winning all five frames and not letting Carter score a point in four of them.\nO'Sullivan made breaks of 59, 117, 74, 123 and 131, but in the post-match news conference stressed he was trying to \"rebuild\" his technique after losing faith in his ability.\nHe said: \"I couldn't even watch myself play as I could see what was wrong. I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'.\n\"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things. I had lost all connection with the cue, the timing had gone, the touch had gone, feeling had gone. Years and years of that mounted up and it got to the point where I couldn't play and it got too much.\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't pull the cue forwards and backwards, which was quite scary.\"\nO'Sullivan beat Carter in the Crucible finals in 2008 and 2012\nFour seeded players, including world champions Kyren Wilson and Neil Robertson and last year's runner-up Jak Jones have been eliminated from O'Sullivan's half of the draw.\nChinese qualifier Pang Junxu is his opponent in the second round, although O'Sullivan said he enjoyed his Crucible return because he had not placed any expectations on himself. \n\"This game can humble you so many times,\" said O'Sullivan. \"To play one good session. It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there.\n\"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much.\n\"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\"\nCarter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday.\n\"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well.\n\"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'.\n\"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp. This boy is in that [bracket]. It's been over an extended period as well, and when he plays the cue ball sings.\n\"O'Sullivan seems in a very good place. He was born to play snooker, and when he's out there he's at peace with it.\"\nRuthless O'Sullivan cruises into Crucible last 16\nWatch: World Snooker Championship - Trump leads Zhou, Selby v Woollaston\nWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage",

It will be open for 24 hours.\nThe children's images were shared by parents who are part of the Parents' Network.

She says his social media accounts could provide evidence. An inquest into his death found he took his own life.\nEarlier in the week, Ms Roome told BBC Breakfast: \"It's too late for our son Jools, but there are plenty of other children around the world that we still need to help. This is a massive issue globally.\n\"There was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem.\" \nMark Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13 in 2022, said: \"All we're asking is... please help us protect our children.\"\nA coroner ruled that Isaac died as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame.\nLisa Kenevan, Isaac's mother, said the families banding together had given them strength.\n\"Our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,\" she said.\nThe Kenevans filed a wrongful death lawsuit against TikTok in the US earlier this year alongside three other British families.\nThe lawsuit accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time.\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has said it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online. The firm said it had recently introduced \"teen accounts\" with enhanced protections.\n\"We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,\" Meta said in a statement.\nIn the UK on Thursday, the media regulator Ofcom published measures intended to improve protections for children online, including requiring tougher age checks and more robust action to prevent children accessing harmful content.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

        "article_text": "Attorneys delivered opening statements on Wednesday in the New York retrial of Harvey Weinstein, with prosecutors accusing the disgraced film producer of using his immense power in Hollywood to sexually harass and abuse three women. \n\"The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday. \nIn his third trial in five years, Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress and a model. \nThe former film mogul has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility.\nAttorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would \"fall flat on its face\" after they heard all the evidence.\n\"They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,\" he said.\nA court of appeals overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, before he was indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.\nLast week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate. \nOn Wednesday, Ms Lucey spent an hour delivering an opening statement, telling jurors that three women had fallen victim to the abuse of a \"Hollywood gatekeeper\" who held \"unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry\".\nThe retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16. \nOn Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them. \nVictims \"kept their shame and their pain to themselves\" for years because of Weistein's role as a man who \"defined the field\" of acting and film, Ms Lucey said. \nDuring his hour of opening statements that followed, Weinstein's attorney took a combative approach, accusing the women of having \"mutually beneficial\" sexual relationships with Weinstein and being motivated by money. \n\"These women are addicted to that fame,\" Mr Aidala said. \"They want to be heroes.\" \nMr Aidala argued that Weinstein could not have assaulted the women because they kept in contact with him and sent him friendly messages after the encounters. \nLast April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over. \nWeinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.\nHe was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.\nWeinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he was taken to hospital for heart surgery and has been held in a secure hospital unit. \nA judge has approved a request from Weinstein's lawyers to let him stay at the Bellevue hospital in Manhattan when he is not in court. \nHis lawyers had complained that he was receiving poor medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous Rikers Island prison facility - which officials have long said they plan to close - though the move has been delayed. \nIn total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women. \nHe is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, as he has yet to begin serving his 16-year California sentence. \nThe decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.\nSpeaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they \"suddenly realized they were not alone\".\nBefore the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.\nWeinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.\nHis films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.\nThe former film mogul has also faced a number of civil lawsuits, including from a group of women who accused him of sexual harassment and rape and reached a $19m (\u00a314.2) settlement with him in 2020.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nFighting Benn is 10 times bigger now - Eubank\nParading in luxury designer finery, rubbing shoulders with A-list celebrities and playing poker with filthy-rich footballers \u2013 Chris Eubank Jr has never really marketed himself as a man of the people.\nBut, deep down, everybody wants to be liked, and the 35-year-old is no different.\n\"People say that 'he's been happy to play the bad guy'. I wasn't happy about it,\" Eubank says.\n\"I didn't like getting booed into arenas for all these years. I don't like waking up and going on my Instagram and seeing people saying 'you're going to get knocked out' and 'you're not as good as your old man'.\"\nThe Brighton boxer says he has learned to accept, even \"relish\", the villain tag. In the build-up to Saturday's fight with Conor Benn, however, the lines between the 'good' and 'bad' guys have blurred.\nEubank will face his fellow Briton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in boxing's latest grudge match \u2013 two and a half years after their cancelled bout because of Benn's failed drugs tests.\nBenn has since been cleared to fight and denies intentionally doping, but the scandal has tarnished his reputation. Consequently, it's morphed Eubank into British boxing's unlikely antihero.\n\"I don't know what to expect. This could be the first fight in history where both guys in a mega fight get booed into an arena,\" Eubank says.\n\"[But] however much of a bad guy I am, I didn't cheat. I walked the hard path being that bad guy.\"\nWhile his public image may be improving, Eubank's fractured relationship with his father, Chris Eubank Sr, has threatened to overshadow the fight.\n\"I've told him I want him there [on Saturday]. I've told him what it means to me, the public, to the fight fans,\" Eubank says. \"He doesn't seem to care or he doesn't seem to understand.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, an emotional Eubank opens up on their public fall-out and what happens if he loses to Benn on Saturday.\nEubank misses weight and fined \u00a3375,000\n'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals pain\nEubank v Benn to be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live\nThis video can not be played\n'My father thinks I'm a disgrace' - Eubank reveals pain\nAs each day passes in fight week, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that Eubank Sr will attend Saturday's fight. \nHe had been an ever-present at the start of his son's career, but their relationship has become strained.\n\"It got to a stage where I realised for the public to be able to see who I was as a man and as a fighter, I had to step away from that huge figure,\" Eubank says.\nBarry Hearn said Eubank Sr, who he promoted for a number of years, was a \"very strict disciplinarian as a father\".\n\"He said to me once 'Bazza, how do you let your boy talk to you like that?\" Hearn said.\n\"I said to him 'your son has to be your friend as well, Chris'. I don't think he ever bought into that.\"\nEubank acknowledges the public interest in his life and is open to discussing issues far more important than boxing. \nWhile he has forged a reputation of being a composed fighter, outside of the ring he has shown his emotions and vulnerability to the public, with his personal life tinged with tragedy over the past four years.\nIn 2021, his 29-year-old brother Sebastian died of a heart attack in Dubai. Eubank has become a father figure to his nephew, who was just a month old at the time.\nEubank Sr has labelled the Benn bout a \"circus\" because of the weight disparity; Benn is going up two divisions and Eubank is prohibited from rehydrating more than 10lb after the weigh-in.\n\"I think this fight once it's over, there's a possibility that things may be able to reconcile or there's a possibility it will make our relationship even harder to rebuild,\" Eubank Jr says.\n\"What I do know is once I am out of boxing, then it will definitely be easier for us to rebuild what's been lost.\"\nHow 'nepo kid' Benn has prepared for Eubank fight\n5 Live Boxing with Bunce: Eddie & Barry Hearn\nAs Eubank has stepped out of his father's shadow, more of him as a man and fighter has emerged.\nEubank is quite the maverick, a boxer who never pinned himself down to one promoter or trainer for a significant length of time.\nRecent outbursts have even landed him in legal bother and subsequent retractions.\n\"So many boxers and fighters get caught up in the treachery of the people that are in the industry,\" he says, describing the sport as \"shady\".\nWhile he may have burnt bridges with influential boxing people down to a crisp, Eubank is perfectly capable of single-handedly promoting a fight.\nJust like Chris Eubank Sr did with Nigel Benn during their rivalry in the 1990s, Jr \u2013 minus his father's monocle and jodhpurs - seems to know which buttons will inflame an opponent.\nHe says that targeting Benn's emotions is not a deliberate ploy, though.\n\"I've never thought I need to think of something that's really going to get to Conor. I don't care about Conor. I only care about me,\" Eubank says.\nReferencing the now-infamous incident when he slapped Benn across the face with an egg \u2013 which resulted in a \u00a3100,000 fine \u2013 Eubank feels he kept his composure.\n\"I had Nigel Benn's hand wrapped around my neck at one point, but if you see my face, it's like I'm walking down the street,\" he says.\n\"I'm not angry, I'm not scared, I'm not worried. I'm just looking at him. I'm not wasting energy on these guys.\"\nEubank said he wanted to humiliate Benn by slapping him with an egg at a news conference last month\nEubank has proven his quality with wins over former world champions Arthur Abraham, James DeGale and Liam Smith. He has a lot to be proud of.\nHe is fully aware, however, that a defeat to Benn could end up defining his 14-year career.\n\"There's so much at stake \u2013 respect, family, pride, money and my career. I said it, if I lose I retire. That is a horrible thing to say and to know but it's the truth,\" he says.\nEvaluating Eubank's boxing career depends on how you measure success.\nIn 37 fights, he is yet to capture a world title. He lost his only challenge for world honours to George Groves in 2018.\nIf he never becomes a world champion, is it a case of unfulfilled potential? Eubank has certainly shown he is capable enough.\nAs a commodity, though, Eubank remains one of British boxing's biggest draws. He has sold out arenas and earned seven-figure paydays.\nAnd he is not ready to give it all up just yet.\n\"I love being a fighter. I love training. I love competing. I love testing myself mentally and physically,\" he says.\n\"This is my life. On April 27th, I don't want to wake up and say it's done.

I wasn't happy about it,\" Eubank says. I've told him what it means to me, the public, to the fight fans,\" Eubank says. \"It got to a stage where I realised for the public to be able to see who I was as a man and as a fighter, I had to step away from that huge figure,\" Eubank says.Barry Hearn said Eubank Sr, who he promoted for a number of years, was a \"very strict disciplinarian as a father\". \"While his public image may be improving, Eubank's fractured relationship with his father, Chris Eubank Sr, has threatened to overshadow the fight.",

        "article_text": "Stars from the reality television show Love On The Spectrum went on the defensive  after Robert F Kennedy Jr commented that people with autism make limited contributions to society. \nPeople with autism \"will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go on a date\", the US Health and Human Services chief said earlier this month.\nThe remarks drew widespread anger from people with autism who reject the notion of needing to be repaired, but also responses from those pushing for a greater understanding of autism.\n\"Autistic people have the same hopes, dreams and yes, the same awkward dating moments as anyone else,\" Dani Bowman, one of the television show's star's said to US media. \nThe reality TV star on the show, which is about a group of autistic adults' experiences dating, said Kennedy's comments were \"completely false\". \nSince joining the Trump administration, Kennedy, who in the past has promoted debunked theories suggesting autism is linked to vaccines, has made autism a main focus. Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThat rise is, at least in part, attributable to increased autism awareness and an expanding definition of the disorder, scientists say. First recognized as a developmental disorder in 1978, autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that symptoms vary by person. Some need little to no support in their daily lives, while others need a great amount. \nEarlier this month, Kennedy pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months. He did not give details on the project or funding it. He also said his department would investigate potential causes.\n\"Everything is on the table - our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting, all the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic,\" Kennedy later told Fox News. \nExperts have warned that finding the causes of autism spectrum disorder will not be straightforward, and called the effort misguided and unrealistic.\nThe idea of curing autism is concerning for some.\n\"Wanting to cure autism implies that our way of being is wrong and it isn't,\" Ms Bowman told NewsNation. \"We don't need to be fixed. We need to be supported. But the answer isn't erasing autism, it's building a more inclusive world for all of us.\"\nAnother star of Love on the Spectrum, James B Jones, attacked Kennedy's autism remarks on social media, calling them \"extremely ignorant, and to be perfectly frank, downright offensive\".\nBut not everyone agrees. \nWhile advocacy groups focus on acceptance and inclusion they avoid \"uncomfortable truths about children like mine\", Emily May, who has a child with autism, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece on Friday.\n\"I have no interest in defending Mr. Kennedy, whose shaky science and conspiracy theories will do nothing to benefit those with autism and their families,\" Ms May said.  \"And yet, I think his remarks echo the reality and pain of a subset of parents of children with autism who feel left out of much of the conversation around the condition.\"\nOne of Kennedy's main false claims was that \"autism comes from vaccines\". Although he has denied many times that  he is anti-vaccination and said he and his children are vaccinated, he has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccine harm.\nThe theory came from a study by Andrew Wakefield in 1998, but it was later retracted by the Lancet medical journal. Multiple studies since have concluded there is no link between vaccines and autism.\nDespite her frustration, Ms May expressed admiration for Kennedy's \"willingness to speak frankly about the painful parts of [her] child's life\".\nAutism Speaks, an advocacy organisation, agreed in part with Ms May. \nThe organisation said it heard from parents who felt Kennedy's comments resonated \"with their lived experience\". \n\"The language we use matters,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement to the BBC. \"It should reflect current science and honor the lived experiences of autistic people, many of whom lead fulfilling lives and make invaluable contributions to their families, workplaces and communities.\"\nDr Manish Arora, founder of LinusBio who has spent more than two decades studying autism, noted that Kennedy's statements can be \"very hurtful for families and autistic individuals\". \nBut he also welcomed more research into the causes of autism and said increased attention is a \"meaningful opportunity\". \nStill, he wishes the debate was \"less polarising\". \n\"Scientists should see the opportunity here, avoid the polarised discourse and see the opportunities here,\" Dr Arora told the BBC. \nJake Tilk, and his brother, Max Tilk, who is on the autism spectrum, largely avoid that political discourse in their social media videos where they share what their day-to-day life looks. \nThey share their lives online to create awareness and acceptance of autism, because the brothers want to celebrate neurodiversity, Jake Tilk told the BBC. \n\"It's most important that discussions about autism are grounded in science, compassion and most importantly the living experiences of people with autism themselves,\" he said.

International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.\nSpeaking to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 , Kneecap's manager said: \"If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.\"\nDaniel Lambert added: \"Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.\"\nHe also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as \"too severe to get into\".\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that \"may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted\".\nThe band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.\nOn Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included \"projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech\".\n\"This band openly support terrorist organizations,\" she added.\nMs Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).\n\"Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,\" Osbourne said.\n\"However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,\" she continued.\n\"This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\" Osbourne said.\n\"I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,\" she said.\nOsbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.\nShe also managed her husband's solo career.\nOsbourne finished her post by saying: \"As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.\n\"I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.\" \nThe festival organisers have been approached for comment.\nWarning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive\nAt the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.\nThe first message said: \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" followed by: \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,\" and a final screen added: \"[Expletive] Israel. Free Palestine.\"\nDuring the performance, band member Mo Chara said: \"The Irish not so long ago were persecuted at the hands of the Brits, but we were never bombed from the... skies with nowhere to go.\n\"The Palestinians have nowhere to go.\"\nThe band also led the audience in chants of: \"Free, free Palestine\".\nOn 11 April, during Kneecap's first Coachella performance, the group faced criticism after leading an anti-Margaret Thatcher chant - which was subsequently omitted from the festival's livestream - along with calls for a united Ireland.\nA US State Department spokesperson said: \"Due to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally will not comment on department actions with respect to specific cases.\"\nThey said the Trump administration \"is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process\".\n\"When considering revocations, the department looks at information that arises after the visa was issued that may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted,\" they added.\n\"This can include everything from arrests, criminal convictions, and engaging in conduct that is inconsistent with the visa classification, to an overstay.\"",

        "article_text": "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.\nI have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.\nStanding at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.\nToday the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.\nHe explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.\nPassers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.\nThey reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.\nUnitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.\nThe potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.\nIt could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.\nBut the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe. \nIntroducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.\nTo be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.\nSo much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.\n\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.\n\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning \u2013 such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way \u2013 a challenge,\" they said. \nAt the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.\nFor now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories. \nThe highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.\nOther carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.\nThomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.\nMr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.\n\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says. \nUnitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (\u00a312,500).\nAlso, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.\nIn a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest. \nChinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government. \nFor example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.\nSo how can US and European robot makers compete with that?\nBristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.\nWhile the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia. \n\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.\n\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"\nAs well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.\nDesigned for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.\n\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.\nWhere possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter. \n\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.\nLike his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.\n\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it. \n\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.\nHe says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.\nThe KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year. \nSo will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.\n\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.\n\"I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that's at least 10 to 15 years away.\"",

        "article_text": "Stars from the reality television show Love On The Spectrum went on the defensive  after Robert F Kennedy Jr commented that people with autism make limited contributions to society. \nPeople with autism \"will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go on a date\", the US Health and Human Services chief said earlier this month.\nThe remarks drew widespread anger from people with autism who reject the notion of needing to be repaired, but also responses from those pushing for a greater understanding of autism.\n\"Autistic people have the same hopes, dreams and yes, the same awkward dating moments as anyone else,\" Dani Bowman, one of the television show's star's said to US media. \nThe reality TV star on the show, which is about a group of autistic adults' experiences dating, said Kennedy's comments were \"completely false\". \nSince joining the Trump administration, Kennedy, who in the past has promoted debunked theories suggesting autism is linked to vaccines, has made autism a main focus. Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThat rise is, at least in part, attributable to increased autism awareness and an expanding definition of the disorder, scientists say. First recognized as a developmental disorder in 1978, autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that symptoms vary by person. Some need little to no support in their daily lives, while others need a great amount. \nEarlier this month, Kennedy pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months. He did not give details on the project or funding it. He also said his department would investigate potential causes.\n\"Everything is on the table - our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting, all the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic,\" Kennedy later told Fox News. \nExperts have warned that finding the causes of autism spectrum disorder will not be straightforward, and called the effort misguided and unrealistic.\nThe idea of curing autism is concerning for some.\n\"Wanting to cure autism implies that our way of being is wrong and it isn't,\" Ms Bowman told NewsNation. \"We don't need to be fixed. We need to be supported. But the answer isn't erasing autism, it's building a more inclusive world for all of us.\"\nAnother star of Love on the Spectrum, James B Jones, attacked Kennedy's autism remarks on social media, calling them \"extremely ignorant, and to be perfectly frank, downright offensive\".\nBut not everyone agrees. \nWhile advocacy groups focus on acceptance and inclusion they avoid \"uncomfortable truths about children like mine\", Emily May, who has a child with autism, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece on Friday.\n\"I have no interest in defending Mr. Kennedy, whose shaky science and conspiracy theories will do nothing to benefit those with autism and their families,\" Ms May said.  \"And yet, I think his remarks echo the reality and pain of a subset of parents of children with autism who feel left out of much of the conversation around the condition.\"\nOne of Kennedy's main false claims was that \"autism comes from vaccines\". Although he has denied many times that  he is anti-vaccination and said he and his children are vaccinated, he has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccine harm.\nThe theory came from a study by Andrew Wakefield in 1998, but it was later retracted by the Lancet medical journal. Multiple studies since have concluded there is no link between vaccines and autism.\nDespite her frustration, Ms May expressed admiration for Kennedy's \"willingness to speak frankly about the painful parts of [her] child's life\".\nAutism Speaks, an advocacy organisation, agreed in part with Ms May. \nThe organisation said it heard from parents who felt Kennedy's comments resonated \"with their lived experience\". \n\"The language we use matters,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement to the BBC. \"It should reflect current science and honor the lived experiences of autistic people, many of whom lead fulfilling lives and make invaluable contributions to their families, workplaces and communities.\"\nDr Manish Arora, founder of LinusBio who has spent more than two decades studying autism, noted that Kennedy's statements can be \"very hurtful for families and autistic individuals\". \nBut he also welcomed more research into the causes of autism and said increased attention is a \"meaningful opportunity\". \nStill, he wishes the debate was \"less polarising\". \n\"Scientists should see the opportunity here, avoid the polarised discourse and see the opportunities here,\" Dr Arora told the BBC. \nJake Tilk, and his brother, Max Tilk, who is on the autism spectrum, largely avoid that political discourse in their social media videos where they share what their day-to-day life looks. \nThey share their lives online to create awareness and acceptance of autism, because the brothers want to celebrate neurodiversity, Jake Tilk told the BBC. \n\"It's most important that discussions about autism are grounded in science, compassion and most importantly the living experiences of people with autism themselves,\" he said.

        "article_text": "Esoteric and pioneering, the paintings of a lesser-known Pre-Raphaelite, Evelyn De Morgan, explored the trauma and meaning of war \u2013 and prefigured current fantasy art.\nOn a rocky beach that glows red with lava, smoke-breathing dragons surround wretched-looking prisoners beseeching an angel to deliver them from suffering. The oil painting Death of the Dragon by Evelyn De Morgan looks at first like a scene from the New Testament's apocalyptic Book of Revelation. But, painted between 1914 and 1918, it's also something more personal and critical: an allegory for the misery and bondage of World War One, and the confrontation between good and evil.\nThe spectacular painting, measuring more than a metre high, is one of the highlights of a new exhibition, Evelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London, at London's Guildhall Art Gallery, home to the City of London Corporation's art collection. On display are rarely seen works from the De Morgan Foundation, as well as two newly-restored paintings and two recreations, completed just last year, of works lost in an art warehouse fire in 1991.\u00a0\nThe show coincides with the reopening of the De Morgan Museum in Barnsley, Yorkshire, following an extensive roof renovation, and responds to a rising interest in this lesser-known artist. She has tended to be eclipsed by her husband William \u2013 a ceramicist and writer, who had worked early in his career with the textile designer William Morris \u2013 and the famous men in their circle: her uncle and art teacher, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, for example, and the painters William Holman Hunt and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Much of what we know about De Morgan today comes from her sister Wilhelmina, who set up the De Morgan Foundation, but even she saw fit to publish the couple's posthumous biography under the title William De Morgan and his Wife.\nYet, Evelyn De Morgan more than deserves the art world's belated acclaim. A Slade graduate, who was working at the tail end of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, she took the arguably twee or overly sentimental genre into new territory, creating tableaux that were unusually visionary and energetic. The women she portrayed were less passive than those depicted by her contemporaries, and featured as symbols of agency rather than objects of the male gaze. Instead of a drowned body floating down the river, as in Sir John Everett Millais' Ophelia, or figures whose main currency was their looks, we meet a skilled sorceress creating magical potions and flying superheroines who can cast rain, thunder and lightning from their fingers.\nThese goddess-like figures show the influence of the classical art that De Morgan had studied. Immaculately executed works such as Boreas and Oreithyia (1896) reveal her interest in mythology and her mastery of the human form, reminiscent of Michelangelo.\nIn Death of the Dragon, in terms of composition, it's easy to see the influence of Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus (1483\u20131485), which De Morgan had visited in Florence. If De Morgan's haloed angel echoes this idea of rebirth \u2212 reflecting the artist's belief in a spiritual afterlife \u2212 then the winged beasts are its counterpart, Death, always biting at the heels of the people and threatening to overcome them. Elsewhere in her work, Death takes alternative forms: a dark angel bearing a scythe, sea monsters or \u2013 more obliquely \u2013 a sand timer. It's a symbolism that speaks to life's transience, and acquires additional poignancy in her later work, conveying the collective trauma of living through a World War that claimed close to a million British lives.\n\"During the First World War they [the De Morgans] were in London, so they would have been directly affected,\" Jean McMeakin, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the De Morgan Foundation, tells the BBC. \"Death was real for them in a way that perhaps we've largely forgotten these days,\" she points out. \"Members of William's family died from tuberculosis, and his own health was often quite poor. Death was, in a way, always present in the background.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why this iconic 1839 painting is not what it seems\n\u2022 The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel\n\u2022 Nine striking, rare photos of 19th-Century America\nDe Morgan was a pacifist and her art became a form of activism. In Our Lady of Peace (1907), a response to the Boer Wars, a knight pleads for protection and peace, while in The Poor Man who Saved the City (1901), wisdom and diplomacy are advocated as alternatives to military intervention. Later, in The Red Cross (1914-16), angels carry the crucified Christ over a withered landscape pierced by Belgian war graves \u2013 a suggestion, perhaps, that the Christian faith is at odds with the brutality of war, but offers us hope of redemption. \"You must never praise war,\" De Morgan declared in The Result of an Experiment (1909), a book of \"automatic writing\" co-authored with her husband. \"The Devil invented it, and you can have no conception of its horrors.\"\nThe idea of the forces of good and evil acting upon ordinary people was pervasive at this time. \"Spiritualism was quite popular,\" asserts McMeakin, citing the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle \u2013 the creator of Sherlock Holmes \u2013 as one of its most famous adherents. Other-worldly beliefs, she says, were \"probably the result of the turmoil, the massive changes happening in society leading up to the turn of the century, plus a period of many wars, which would have had an impact on their view of the world\". Doubtless, De Morgan was also influenced by her mother-in-law, Sophia, a well-known spiritualist and medium. With so many lives lost, it was no doubt tempting to believe that you could reconnect with the departed.\nFor De Morgan, materialism was in opposition to spirituality, and many of her works conflate the pursuit of wealth with death. Crowns, as worn by the winged serpents in Death of the Dragon, are a repeated motif denoting greed and miserliness. In Earthbound (1897), an avaricious king in a gold cloak patterned with coins is about to be overwhelmed by the angel of death, while in The Barred Gate (c.1910-1914), a similar figure is denied entry to Heaven.\nWith the future so uncertain, De Morgan places the importance of spiritual fulfilment and happiness at the centre of much of her work. In Blindness and Cupidity Chasing Joy from the City (1897), for example, \"Cupidity\" is personified as a crowned figure clutching treasures who is driving away \"Joy\" in the form of an angel. Here, as in Death of the Dragon, the central characters are chained, suggesting trapped souls.\nIn The Prisoner (1907-1908), the barred window and a woman's chained wrists make captivity a metaphor for gender inequality, hinting at the De Morgans' support for universal suffrage (Evelyn was a signatory of at least two important petitions, while her husband was vice-president of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage). The theme recurs in Luna (1885), where the rope-bound body of a moon goddess, a mythological figure of feminine power, functions as a metaphor for a woman's struggle to influence her own destiny.\u00a0\nChristened \"Mary\", Evelyn later adopted her then-gender-neutral middle name, as women's art was not taken seriously. \"She wanted to be considered on the same level as her male peers,\" says McMeakin. \"We can assume a huge degree of self-possession and determination in her desire to become a professional artist,\" she adds, making the point that even De Morgan's mother opposed her career choice.\nTechnically, De Morgan was also a pioneer. She experimented with burnishing and rubbing gold pigment into her works to add depth and interest, and explored new painting techniques invented by her husband, made by grinding colours with glycerine and spirit. Stylistically, she was also ahead of her time. The unconventional use of pinks and purples, and the bold rings of rainbow-coloured light, prefigure the psychedelic painting styles of the 1970s, while her terrifying monsters would not look out of place in contemporary fantasy art.\nWhile art history has tended to paint women as virgin mothers, objects of beauty or temptresses, De Morgan's specifically female perspective recasts them as figures of hope that augur an alternative, brighter future. In Lux in Tenebris (light in darkness) (1895), for example, the female figure holds an olive branch in her right hand, offering a pathway to peace. In Death of the Dragon, the angel is surrounded by a magnificent rainbow: a symbol (along with the sky) of joy that denotes spiritual fulfilment and freedom, as well as the promise of an afterlife.\nIt's a mistake to think of works such as Death of the Dragon as \"completely bleak\", argues McMeakin, noting that \"often with [her] apocalyptic scenes, there is a glimmer of hope, or a part of the painting that is calm\". In many ways, Death of the Dragon is optimistic, expressing a sense that the war \u2013 the metaphorical dragon \u2013 is nearing its end, and that good can overcome evil. In this existential battle, De Morgan saw a place for her work. When she was aged\u00a0 just 17, she chastised herself for not painting enough. \"Art is eternal, but life is short,\" she wrote in her diary. \"I will make up for it now, I have not a moment to lose.\"\nEvelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London is at the Guildhall Art Gallery, London until 4 January 2026.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, and\u00a0Instagram",

        "article_text": "I recently saw a statistic that surprised me: in February of 2025, Americans used their television sets to watch YouTube more than anything else. More than Disney. More than HBO. Even more than Netflix.\nI often think of YouTube as a service for young people \u2013 specifically, young people using their phones. But that's all changing. A recent report by research firm Moffett Nathanson projects that by the end of this year, YouTube's revenue will eclipse that of the entire Walt Disney Company (movies, theme parks and all). That report put it bluntly, dubbing YouTube the \"king of all media\".\nBut what does it mean for the rest of the entertainment industry when YouTube is more popular than anything else and YouTube stars seem just as likely to receive big Hollywood deals as A-list actors?\nI spoke about all of this with Lucas Shaw, a reporter and editor for Bloomberg and the author of the Screentime newsletter. It was a fun conversation \u2013 you can watch or read more of it here:\nBelow are excerpts from our conversation, which have been edited for length and clarity:\nKatty Kay: Lucas, people who became famous on YouTube \u2013 Mr. Beast, Cocomelon, etc \u2013 are now getting their own shows on streaming platforms. Is that the direction that we're going to see this going, where increasingly YouTube becomes the incubator for shows that then go onto streaming?\nLucas Shaw: Hollywood studios and TV networks have tried to make programming with social media talent \u2013 especially YouTube stars \u2013 for at least a decade now. Lilly Singh was a big YouTuber who got a late-night talk show; it didn't quite work. Grace Helbig was a big YouTuber who got a talk show. There were some movies that cast talent. We're now seeing a second or third attempt at it.\nI think part of the reason is that these stars have gotten so big that there is now greater confidence that they can deliver. And part of it is that Hollywood companies have learned that they can't force some of this talent into their formats. They have to sort of empower them to continue doing what they're doing. So, the Mr. Beast show for Amazon is just like a maximal version of what he does on his YouTube channel. And with Cocomelon, they're basically licensing YouTube videos and then paying them to make slightly longer and more expensive versions of it. We'll continue to see more of that.\u00a0\nKK: So, there's a difference in what it takes to be successful on YouTube compared to what it takes to be successful on traditional television and streaming platforms?\nLS: Yeah, I think so. I think what people want on YouTube is different from what they want from Netflix, at least for now. People come to like a creator for doing a specific thing.\nThere was a point in time at which this Swedish gaming creator PewDiePie was the biggest YouTube star in the world and YouTube funded an original program with him as part of this original programming initiative that they had. And it didn't resonate in the same way that his channel did, because it wasn't what people came to watch. People liked watching him speak off the cuff while playing games. There was an intimacy to that, but there was also a rawness and it felt sort of less sanitised and manicured. And so, then seeing him being a star of a more traditional TV show, even though it's already on YouTube, I just don't think it appealed to those people in the same way.\nKK: Lucas, you just came back from a trip around Asia. Is there no global competitor \u2013 or even an American competitor \u2013 who looks like it's going to knock YouTube off its perch of such huge dominance?\u00a0\nLS: There was definitely a moment where TikTok appeared to be that \u2013 and YouTube was intimidated because a lot of emerging and independent creators were posting to TikTok first. One of YouTube's great strengths historically was that it lowered the barrier to entry for anyone who wanted to make a video. And that barrier started to feel higher to some, because YouTube had gotten so big and there were established players. So, going from zero to 100 got much harder and they saw creators going to TikTok instead. TikTok is still a big competitor, but there just isn't anything that operates in as many different categories as YouTube. Spotify is competing with YouTube in music and in podcasting and in some video.\nNetflix obviously competes with YouTube globally; I'd say it's one of the biggest competitors in terms of entertainment. But YouTube and Netflix just play different roles, because YouTube is free. For instance, YouTube has hundreds of millions of users in India. Netflix has about 15 million. It's just much easier for YouTube to penetrate some of these poorer markets. Now, there's not as much money there, but from a just \"reach as many people as possible\" standpoint, there really isn't a direct comparison. Maybe Instagram.\nKK: I had a conversation recently with Jonathan Haidt and we were talking about kids and screen time and it occurred to me that so many of the social media companies \u2013 TikTok, Instagram, and others \u2013 have been hauled up before Congress to justify what they're doing. And YouTube seems to have escaped some of that scrutiny. How has it done that and do you think it'll carry on doing that?\nLS: I think it comes back to this idea that people don't know how to categorise YouTube. It is in some ways a social network, right? And I think some people initially saw it that way because it came from Silicon Valley, because there were comments, because people were uploading their own videos. But it is also an entertainment platform. But also, at its core \u2013 because it's part of Google \u2013 it's a search engine. That's in a lot of ways how Google views it. It's a video search engine. And so, I think the difficulty of categorising it has just made it so that people aren't quite sure how to approach it.\u00a0\nBut you're right that they haven't received the same scrutiny from a regulatory perspective, certainly not as much as Meta or TikTok, and it's a little bit baffling. You know, speaking from an American perspective, it is so funny to me that the government would not allow one company to own two domestic broadcast television networks, but it's fine that Meta owns both Facebook and Instagram, both of which reach way more people than any broadcast network. Or it's fine that Alphabet owns both Google and YouTube, both of which reach way more people than any broadcast TV network. So, I think part of this is also that our regulatory behavior is pretty antiquated.\nEditorial Note:\nThis conversation took place before the Federal Trade Commission and Mark Zuckerberg's\u00a0antitrust hearing\u00a0regarding Meta, Facebook and Instagram's parent company.\nKK:\u00a0What are the big changes that you see coming to the platform in the next year or two?\u00a0\nLS:\u00a0I'd say, in aggregate, the big change is that as more advertising dollars flow to YouTube creators and channels will have more money to invest in their programming. There's a pretty widely held belief that you'll continue to see the caliber and cost of some of the top YouTube shows go up and more closely resemble television. You may see some more expensive unscripted shows. Mr. Beast is one example, right? The average cost of one of his videos is $3m three or four million dollars, which is comparable to what you'd see on television, but not comparable to almost anything else you'd see on YouTube.\nAnother big area that I'm actually in the middle of writing a story about now is the growth of scripted programming. It's still pretty small on YouTube, partially because it is more complicated and more expensive. I think another part of it is that YouTube as a platform is just more hospitable to unscripted programming. But as it becomes possible to make more money on YouTube and as it becomes clearer to top writers and actors that there's a much bigger audience on YouTube than some of these other places, I think you'll see more and more people try scripted.\nKK:\u00a0Is YouTube the straw that broke the camel's back of monoculture? I grew up in an era where there were still just a few channels on television. Everybody watched the same thing. But now, it seems that it is really broken. And I wonder whether people will start hankering for that again, for a common experience in this very fragmented, polarised, divided world that we live in.\nLS:\u00a0I don't know the answer to that. I think we like the idea of there being a monoculture, right? It's fun when you have a moment like when\u00a0Barbie\u00a0came out and it seemed like everyone was talking about the movie or the\u00a0Taylor Swift tour\u00a0happens and everyone is talking about this tour. We are social creatures, and so we enjoy these moments where everyone is bonded by the same idea or interested in the same topic. But it certainly doesn't feel like we're on the precipice of returning to that in any way.\nIf you think about how Netflix and YouTube work, which are the two dominant entertainment platforms right now, they are tailored to your individual tastes. People don't watch shows and videos at the same time. There are things that go viral, but that virality is fairly short-lived.\u00a0\nI guess\u00a0Adolescence\u00a0in some ways feels like a monoculture moment, right? Everyone is watching and talking about this show. But unlike in the past, when that might last for the 10 or 20 or 30 weeks that it's on, it lasts for a week or two. And then, we're on to the next one. That pattern feels like it will only continue and accelerate. I don't see us reverting to some world in which we are all watching the same thing, unless there's a fundamental shift in the distribution mechanism.\u00a0\nKK:\u00a0Yeah, it's been described to me as a moment where we're living in a \"me culture\" with short attention spans.\nLS:\u00a0Yeah, because it's all about YouTube, Instagram, Netflix. Everything feels like they are serving you specifically, as opposed to serving all of us collectively.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.",

        "article_text": "Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he \"was dead\" in the immediate aftermath.\nThe England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.\nSpeaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\".\n\"I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,\" he recalled.\n\"I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?\n\"My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.\"\nFlintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his \"biggest fear\" was that he no longer had a face left.\n\"I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\"\nHe recalled being in \"agony\" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.\nThe incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\nHe was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.\nSpeaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.\n\"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.\n\"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\"\nSurgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.\nHe \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said.\nMr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.\nReflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he \"didn't think I had it in me to get through\" the ordeal.\n\"This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,\" he added.\n\"I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...\n\"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\"\nOne of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.\nFlintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery. \n\"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\"\nThe 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.\nThe acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.\nHe also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.\nIn 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.\nThe documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.\nThe fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously. \n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

        "article_text": "Ding Junhui (left) lost in the 2016 world final and Lei Peifan beat reigning world champion Kyren Wilson in the first round of this year's tournament\nPlayers from eight countries have won snooker's most prestigious title of world champion - but China is still waiting for its first success.\nCould 2025 be the year that changes?\nThis season's World Championship last 16 includes six Chinese players - Ding Junhui, Lei Peifan, Pang Junxu, Si Jiahui, Xiao Guodong and Zhao Xintong - with England having the next highest total with five.\n\"This has got to be the biggest year for China in terms of chances of having a world champion,\" said Jason Ferguson, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA).\n\"We've seen players like Lei Peifan winning ranking events and players bounce on to the scene and that could happen here. These boys have no fear and really want it.\n\"If a Chinese player became a world champion there's no doubt that player would become a national hero.\"\nTrailblazer Ding has come the closest to snooker's ultimate glory, losing 18-14 to Mark Selby in the 2016 final.\nOf the six Chinese players left in, four have won ranking tournaments, with two of those coming this season - Xiao at the Wuhan Open in October and Lei in the Scottish Open in December.\n\"There's been a big improvement in Chinese players,\" said Ding. \"In the past two or three seasons, they've improved so quickly.\n\"They're showing people how good they are and they've won tournaments, which says they've got the talent, skills and form to play anybody.\n\"It tells people they're ready to play the biggest tournament and hopefully one of them can win it. I would love to see a Chinese player win a World Championship - it would be great for Chinese snooker and also for the young ones to look at and start playing from a young age.\"\nDing Junhui won the first of his 15 ranking titles just after his 18th birthday at the China Open in 2005\nSince the turn of the century, there has been a British winner at the Crucible in every year apart from when Australian Neil Robertson triumphed in 2010 and Belgium's Luca Brecel took the 2023 title.\nBut a long-term aim from snooker bosses has been to grow the game globally.\n\"Most people thought this sport was very English and would remain this way, but we could see a real burning will to grow in these countries,\" said Ferguson.\nA pivotal moment in snooker's development came when it was added into the World Games in Akita, Japan in August 2001.\n\"That really changed the face of snooker,\" added Ferguson. \"I remember walking into the arena with my friends from Asia and we were carrying a banner in a stadium in front of 60,000 people which said 'Billiards Sports'.\n\"My friend said to me: 'Jason, remember this day, this day is when snooker becomes a sport.'\n\"We had taken this game which was doing well and very popular in England and had turned it into a sport.\"\nSnooker's popularity in China grew at a rapid rate, accelerating when a shy Ding, two days after his 18th birthday, defeated seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry to win the 2005 China Open, watched by a reported television audience of 110 million people in the country.\n\"Because of Ding, snooker now has a big market,\" said world number 12 Zhang Anda. \"Ding being world champion would be good for every player because China is a very big market. I hope he can win the first one.\"\n\"It's not just about major events in China, we've built Chinese snooker from the bottom up,\" said Ferguson.\n\"China embraced this sport and gave it a lot of love and care. The one thing China has got right is access to snooker facilities in schools and mainstream education. That's something we need here.\n\"The players are coming together in academies - there are three in Sheffield - and you find players playing against each other day in, day out and the standard of snooker is absolutely amazing.\"\nChinese snooker, and the sport in general, received a huge setback in June 2023 when 10 players from China received bans for their involvement in match-fixing.\nFormer Masters champion Yan Bingtao was among those banned, while Liang Wenbo and Li Hang were handed lifetime bans.\nZhao, a former UK Championship winner, served an 18-month ban and has been the only player to return after he had not directly thrown a match but accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself.\n\"It was a shame some players fell foul of the rules, it was a really sad time and difficult to deal with,\" said Ferguson.\n\"We kept close to our partners in China and the authorities in snooker. We worked together to educate players better and to ensure the players have opportunities. The sport has recovered and it has not stopped the talent coming through.\"\nHalo World Snooker Championship\n19 April to 5 May\nCrucible Theatre, Sheffield\nWatch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app; live text coverage of selected matches; updates on BBC Radio 5 Live\nPang Junxu beat compatriot Zhang Anda in the first round this year and will play Ronnie O'Sullivan in the last 16\nRobertson knows what it is like to break through the British dominance of snooker and felt the unity the Chinese players were showing this year was a massive boost.\nThe Australian added: \"Xiao Guodong said it's like 'Team China' and they are really happy for each other and I like that mindset. He said they're trying to take the burden off Ding and support him and they're in it together.\n\"The game is getting stronger and stronger in China and it makes first rounds in all tournaments harder as we're only going to get more Chinese players qualifying.\n\"They don't seem fazed by the Crucible and all seem to play well, even on debuts, so it's exciting for snooker. We're seeing a lot of international flags, which is great for the game.\"\nSo what happens to snooker if a Chinese player lifts the famous trophy on Monday, 5 May?\n\"It's something the authorities we've been working in China with have dreamed of, that one day they would have the world champion,\" said Ferguson.\n\"If a Chinese player wins it would be magical, a historical moment, a real shift in the sport, and I can't tell you the media frenzy it would cause for snooker around the world.\"",

It will be open for 24 hours.\nThe children's images were shared by parents who are part of the Parents' Network. This is a support network, set up by Prince Harry and Meghan's Archewell Foundation, for parents whose children have experienced harm from social media.\nPrince Harry and Meghan have been supporting families who say social media played a role in the deaths of their children.\nThey have backed calls to technology firms that say parents should be able to gain access to information on the phones of children who have died, despite arguments about privacy.\nThe prince said tech firms were \"getting away with it\" by arguing they didn't need to disclose information to UK families because of privacy considerations.\n\"You are telling a parent, you are telling a dad and a mum that they can't have the details of what their kid was up to on social media because of the privacy of their kid. It's wrong,\" he said. \nMeghan said the danger of social media was a global issue and \"one thing we can all agree on is that children should be safe\".\nShe praised the parents who were speaking out.\n\"I think in many ways what we see through these parents is the hope and the promise of something better, because... they just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else,\" said Meghan.\nSeparately to Prince Harry and Meghan's event in New York, a group of British parents staged a protest outside Meta's offices on Thursday.\nEllen Roome, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, was among the families. \nShe believes her 14-year-old son Jools died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022. She says his social media accounts could provide evidence. An inquest into his death found he took his own life.\nEarlier in the week, Ms Roome told BBC Breakfast: \"It's too late for our son Jools, but there are plenty of other children around the world that we still need to help. This is a massive issue globally.\n\"There was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem.\" \nMark Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13 in 2022, said: \"All we're asking is... please help us protect our children.\"\nA coroner ruled that Isaac died as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame.\nLisa Kenevan, Isaac's mother, said the families banding together had given them strength.\n\"Our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,\" she said.\nThe Kenevans filed a wrongful death lawsuit against TikTok in the US earlier this year alongside three other British families.\nThe lawsuit accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time.\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has said it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online. The firm said it had recently introduced \"teen accounts\" with enhanced protections.\n\"We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,\" Meta said in a statement.\nIn the UK on Thursday, the media regulator Ofcom published measures intended to improve protections for children online, including requiring tougher age checks and more robust action to prevent children accessing harmful content.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

        "article_text": "In the midst of \"the car capital of the world\", there's a serene vehicle-free island home to 600 people, 600 horses and a once-upon-a-time way of life.\nHome to the \"Motor City\" of Detroit, where companies like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler originated, the US state of Michigan is often called \"the car capital of the world\". But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years \u2013 and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.\nWelcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.\nBut why the absence of autos?\nBecause as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: \"Horse is king here.\"\nAccording to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.\nMore than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,\" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. \"That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.\"\n\"Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,\" Morse adds.\nFor hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or \"place of the great turtle\" in Anishinaabemowin.\nBritish forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.\u00a0\nSaddle Up\nVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson.\n\"Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,\" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. \"The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.\"\nAs Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island \u2013 some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. \"[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,\" he says.\nHemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.\n\"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through\u2026 this is our story,\" says Hemenway. \"[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.\"\nBy the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\u2022 Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the US\nMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.\nWhile the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. \"You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,\" she says.\nIndeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions \u2013 the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.\nElsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.\nHorses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hire\u00a0are the main way residents and visitors get around \u2013 a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.\nLiving in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters.\n\"I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day,\" she says. \"You are always greeting and talking to people.\"\nBut while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island.\n\"Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop',\" says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. \"We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up.\" An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running. \u00a0\u00a0\nSurrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.\nBut in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.\nThe dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes \u2013 the highest point on the island \u2013 and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.\nAnd all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "\"Out! Out! Out!\"\nThe voice in the Telegram video is insistent. Loud. Sometimes musical.\nAnd the message unambiguous.\n\"All of Hamas, out!\"\nOn the streets of Gaza, more and more Palestinians are expressing open defiance against the armed group that's ruled the strip for almost 20 years.\nMany hold Hamas responsible for plunging the tiny, impoverished territory into the worst crisis faced by Palestinians in more than 70 years.\n\"Deliver the message,\" another crowd chants, as it surges through Gaza's devastated streets: \"Hamas is garbage.\"\n\"The world is deceived by the situation in the Gaza Strip,\" says Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza lawyer and former organiser of the 2019 anti-Hamas \"We Want to Live\" movement. \nAl-Natour spoke to us from the shattered remains of his city, the flimsy canvas side of the tent which now forms part of his house billowing behind him.\n\"The world thinks that Gaza is Hamas and Hamas is Gaza,\" he said. \"We didn't choose Hamas and now Hamas is determined to rule Gaza and tie our fate to its own. Hamas must retreat. \"\nSpeaking out is dangerous. Hamas has never tolerated dissent. Al-Natour seems undaunted, writing a furious column for the Washington Post at the end of March.\n\"To support Hamas is to be for Palestinian death,\" he wrote, \"not Palestinian freedom\".\nWasn't it dangerous to speak out in this way, I asked him.\n\"We need to take a risk and speak out,\" he replied without hesitation.\n\"I'm 30 years old. When Hamas took over, I was 11. What have I done with my life? My life has been wasted between war and escalating violence for nothing.\"\nSince Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 by violently ousting political rivals, a year after winning national elections, there have been three major wars with Israel and two smaller conflicts.\n\"Humanity demands that we raise our voices,\" al-Natour said, \"despite suppression by Hamas\".\nHamas may be busy fighting Israel, but it's not afraid to punish its critics.\nAt the end of March, 22-year old Oday al-Rubai was abducted by armed gunmen from a refugee shelter in Gaza City.\nHours later, his body was found covered in horrific wounds.\nThe Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights said Oday had been tortured, calling his death \"a grave violation of the right to life and an extrajudicial killing\".\nAl-Rubai had participated in recent anti-Hamas protests. His family blamed Hamas for his death and demanded justice.\nDays earlier, a frightened al-Rubai posted a dark, grainy video on social media in which he expressed his fear that Hamas militants were coming for him.\n\"Gaza has become a city of ghosts,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder.\n\"I'm stranded in the street, not knowing where to go. I don't know why they're after me. They destroyed us and brought ruin to us.\"\nAt his funeral, a small crowd demanded revenge and repeated demands for Hamas to get out of Gaza.\nLast summer, Amin Abed almost suffered the same fate, following his decision to speak out against Hamas.\nMasked militants beat him senseless, broke bones all over his body and damaged his kidneys. Abed survived but had to seek medical treatment abroad.\nNow living in Dubai, he's still involved in the protest movement, and believes that Hamas' authority is diminished.\n\"Hamas' power has begun to fade,\" he told me.\n\"It targets activists and civilians, beats and kills them to scare people. But it's not how it was before.\"\nBefore the ceasefire collapsed last month, Hamas fighters seemed intent on highly visible displays of power.\nBut now, with Israel once again attacking relentlessly, the same gunmen have retreated underground and Gaza's civilians have been plunged back into the misery of war.\nSome of the more recent protests suggest that civilians, driven to the edge of madness by a year and a half of Israeli bombardment, are losing their fear of Hamas.\nBeit Lahiya, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, has seen some of the most vociferous opposition.\nIn a series of voice notes, an eyewitness \u2013 who asked not to be named \u2013 described several recent incidents in which local residents prevented Hamas fighters from carrying out military actions from inside their community.\nOn 13 April, he said, Hamas gunmen tried to force their way into the house of an elderly man, Jamal al-Maznan.\n\"They wanted to launch rockets and pipes [a derogatory term used for some of Hamas' home-made projectiles] from inside his house,\" the eyewitness told us.\n\"But he refused.\"\nThe incident soon escalated, with relatives and neighbours all coming to al-Maznan's defence. The gunmen opened fire, injuring several people, but eventually were driven out.\n\"They were not intimidated by the bullets,\" the eyewitness said of the protesters.\n\"They advanced and told [the gunmen] to take their things and flee. We don't want you in this place. We don't want your weapons that have brought us destruction, devastation and death.\"\nElsewhere in Gaza, protesters have told militants to stay away from hospitals and schools, to avoid situations in which civilians are caught up in Israeli air strikes.\nBut such defiance is still risky. In Gaza City, Hamas shot one such protester dead.\nWith little to lose and hopes of an end to the war dashed once more, some Gazans direct their fury equally at Israel and Hamas.\nAsked which side he blamed most for Gaza's catastrophe, Amin Abed said it was \"a choice between cholera and the plague\".\nThe protest movement of recent weeks is not yet a rebellion, but after almost 20 years of rule Hamas' iron grip on Gaza is slowly slipping.",

The mayor has repeatedly accused the president and his team of trying to undermine his authority.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme from his office in central Kyiv on Thursday, Klitschko noted that he was \"responsible for the capital of Ukraine\", describing it as \"the heart\" of the war-torn country.\nHe said Zelensky might be forced to take a \"painful solution\" to achieve peace. \nWhen asked whether Zelensky has been discussing with him any details of a possible settlement, Klitschko replied bluntly: \"No.\"\n\"President Zelensky does [it] himself. It's not my function,\" he added.\nReferring to a very public bust-up between Zelensky and Trump at the White House in February, the mayor suggested that key issues between top politicians would be better discussed \"without video cameras\".\nEarlier this week, Trump accused Zelensky of harming peace negotiations, after the Ukrainian leader again ruled out recognising Russian control of Crimea, a southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014.\nTrump has said \"Crimea will stay with Russia\", in an interview with Time magazine on Friday, having previously said the peninsula was \"lost years ago\".  \nBut Zelensky has pointed to a 2018 \"Crimea declaration\" by Trump's then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying the US \"rejects Russia's attempted annexation\".\nUkraine and its European allies have in recent weeks expressed alarm over what many on the continent see as Trump's warming of relations with Vladimir Putin's Russia. \nIn later remarks made after his BBC interview about the possibility of Ukraine ceding territory, Klitschko said he \"did not say anything new\" and that many world politicians and media outlets were discussing it as a potential outcome of a peace deal.\n\"We understand that the scenario involving territorial concessions contradicts our national interests and we must fight against its implementation until the very end. This will require extraordinary efforts both from us and European partners,\" he added.\nAs talks ramp up, Russian strikes on Ukraine have continued. \nOn Thursday, an attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured dozens, officials said. The BBC witnessed the body of a child being brought out from the wreckage of their home while people quietly cried nearby.\nSvitlana, a teacher at a school close by which was also hit, spoke of her hurt and added she believed Russia would not stop its aggression if Ukraine gave up Crimea.\n\"Those who think that Putin will stop if he is given Crimea, they don't know who the Russians are, he is not going to stop,\" she said. \nShe said Zelensky expresses the opinion of \"all of us and we support him\".\nAnother woman, Olha, who had helped rescue workers carry out 10 people, five of whom were dead and the rest injured, was more critical.\n\"As of now I think it's better to be away from here because nothing good awaits us here,\" she said, adding there \"will not be a good solution\" for Ukraine. \nShe said Zelensky \"was a comedian and he should have stayed a comedian\".",

        "article_text": "The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to \"reset\" relations after Brexit.\nLabour has previously said it has \"no plans\" for such a scheme, which would make it easier for young people to study and work abroad.\nBut an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation.

        "article_text": "Katarina Zimmer put vinegar to the test as a cleaning product and discovered a wide range of benefits, for people and the planet.\nA few months ago in my new Berlin apartment, my toilet and I were at war. No amount of scrubbing or toilet cleaner would evict the limescale coating inside. Frustrated, I turned to Google and stumbled across a page recommending vinegar \u2013 something that the previous inhabitant had left behind in abundance. After dropping two tablespoons full of \"Essigessenz\" \u2013 essentially concentrated vinegar \u2013 into the toilet and waiting for half an hour, I scrubbed and the limescale came off in a moment.\u00a0\nSince then, I've enthusiastically used vinegar to rid my world of limescale. I've found it even more effective than my regular kitchen spray cleaner for getting my sink sparkling. That includes the faucet, which I wrapped in a vinegar-soaked kitchen tissue \u2013 whereas my regular cleaning spray dribbled off. And rather than having to buy special tablets to clean my limescale-smothered glass kettle, I simply poured two tablespoons of concentrated vinegar inside and boiled it. As the limescale crackled off, it made a satisfying sizzling sound.\nI wondered if vinegar had other advantages. Did it also kill off bacteria and other germs? And, importantly, was this simple, natural product better for the environment and for my health than regular cleaning products?\u00a0\nThe internet is full of sustainability influencers and green cleaning blogs that advertise vinegar as a jack-of-all-trades and a safer and \"greener\" alternative to \"toxic\" cleaning products. These claims make sense on the surface; vinegar is after all just fermented alcohol and has long been used as a food preservative, in salad dressings, as well as a household cleaner \u2013 but I wanted evidence. After interviewing three experts, I learned that while some of these claims are true, the benefits of vinegar depend a lot on how it's used and the kind of grime you're trying to get rid of.\nReassuringly, Eric Beckman, a chemical engineer and emeritus professor at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, told me that the best cleaning use for acetic acid \u2013 the main component of vinegar \u2013 is exactly what I had been using it for: as a descaler. Limescale \u2013 and rust, for that matter \u2013 consists of certain ions that dissolve more easily in acidic fluids like vinegar, he says. Beckman uses vinegar himself to get limescale off mirrors, while the microbiologist Dirk Bockm\u00fchl of Germany's Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences prefers using lemon juice, which contains citric acid, which he says is a more effective descaler and smells better. (Read more about why vinegar is such an effective cleaner.)\nThat said, vinegar doesn't work on everything. Beckman says that soap does a better job at removing oily films on dishes, while baking soda is effective against processed oils that have stuck onto surfaces while cooking. (Read more about whether baking soda is environmentally friendly).\nHowever, Beckman expresses exasperation about a popular remedy of mixing vinegar together with baking soda. The mixture is chemically quite useless, he says, as the acid of vinegar and the base of baking soda effectively cancel each other out. \"I use both, but not together,\" says Beckman. \"Together, they give you nothing.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nAnd while vinegar is often touted as a powerful antimicrobial, Bockm\u00fchl says, the truth is more nuanced. In a 2020 study, Bockm\u00fchl and his colleagues put vinegar to the test against a selection of disease-causing bacteria, viruses and fungi. While many internet recommendations suggest adding a dash of vinegar into a bucket of water for cleaning, Bockm\u00fchl found that its anti-microbial effects only kick in at an acetic acid concentration of 5% \u2013 its concentration in pure vinegar. And it was only fully effective at distilled concentrations of 10% \u00a0\u2013 to which the researchers added a dash of citric acid \u2013 in killing off five common bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as a mould, a yeast and a weakened strain of the vaccinia virus. Other studies have found that similar concentrations also work against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut even these concentrations didn't work against the MRSA bacterium, an especially stubborn strain of Staphylococcus aureus that's resistant to certain antibiotics, while countless bacteria remain untested. Many bacteria \u2013 including the ones that ferment alcohol into vinegar \u2013 thrive in acids, Beckman adds: \"Then they'll be like, 'ooh, yay, vinegar.'\" Some moulds, too, are resistant to acetic acid while some viruses \u2013 like norovirus \u2013 might be, too, Bockm\u00fchl suspects. Beckman says that soaps are more effective against bacteria, while standard disinfectants work better against viruses and moulds. Harsh treatments like bleach will definitely kill everything, Beckman says \u2013 although bleach can be unsafe if used incorrectly.\nBockm\u00fchl stresses that, even for the germs that vinegar does kill, a relatively high concentration is needed. The concentration won't be adequate \"if you just put a teaspoon of vinegar into your cleaning solution\", Bockm\u00fchl says.\u00a0\nHowever, the higher the dose of acetic acid, the more irritating it can be on the skin, he adds. It is harmful if it gets into your eyes. Surfaces can suffer, too: vinegar corrodes natural stone and metals like copper, bronze and brass, according to the Italian chemist Dario Bressanini's book The Science of Cleaning. And in dishwashers or washing machines, it can harm the rubber gaskets used to seal them, while it could also damage coffee machines and strip away the coating on tiles and grout, Bressanini writes. But Bockm\u00fchl assures me that it's fine to use vinegar on glass and ceramic surfaces \u2013 like my toilet \u2013 and stainless steel sinks.\nThe trouble that Bockm\u00fchl sees with using homemade cleaning products is that they don't come with instructions or safety recommendations. \"They might be safe if you know what you're doing,\" he says, \"but there are a lot of really stupid and absurd recommendations on the internet\".\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Are you cleaning your water bottle enough?\n\u2022 Why you might want to change your bedclothes more often\n\u2022 Seven proven ways to help the planet in 2025 \nTo learn more about how the health risks of vinegar compare with those of conventional cleaners, I called up Nicola Carslaw, professor of indoor air chemistry at the University of York in the UK. Her concern is how cleaners disrupt the air in our homes and buildings. It's known that professional domestic cleaners tend to have higher rates of asthma than other occupational groups, although it's proven difficult to pin that on any single product or ingredient.\nIn a recent study, Carslaw and her colleagues tested 23 different cleaning products including dishwasher fluid, washing up liquid and spray products, and found that many of them released volatile chemical compounds (VOCs). Some of these compounds, like terpenes, are often added to give pleasant aromas, such as lavender or pine oil, but they're highly reactive in the atmosphere. Terpenes for instance, easily react with ozone in the air, creating miniscule particles. In general, inhaling particles of this size has been linked to lung and heart disease.\n\"Your nose is a really good filter for the big particles, but the smaller ones can get all the way into your lungs [and] into the bloodstream,\" Carslaw says. Interestingly, in her study she found that cleaning products marketed as \"natural\" or \"green\" didn't seem any healthier in this regard. \"The natural/green ones had as many, if not more VOCs as the standard cleaners, and in many cases they were more reactive,\" she says.\nBut vinegar, by contrast, only consists of water and acetic acid (and a few other substances that make the difference between red and wine vinegar, for instance). As such, \"it's just not going to be chemically reactive in the same way\", Carslaw says. Another advantage of vinegar is that it's usually applied on a cloth to wipe surfaces rather than used as a spray, Carslaw adds. Research shows that cleaning products applied in spray form have more\u00a0harmful effects on the respiratory system\u00a0than liquids and wipes. (Read more about the health risks associated with cleaning products in Jessica Bradley's story).\u00a0\n\"When you spray something, you're turning the chemical into a form that's much easier to breathe [in] than if you have the liquid,\" Carslaw says. That said, she always advises gloves when there's risk of skin contact, good ventilation and avoiding excessive cleaning, whatever product is used. (Read more about whether we're cleaning too much for our own good).\nThis all left me with one remaining question: is using vinegar more environmentally friendly than conventional cleaners?\u00a0\nThat's a hard question to answer, says Beckman. Ideally, there would be life cycle analyses for cleaning products which track impacts from cradle to grave, tracing each ingredient back to its source, how it's produced, transported, packaged and eventually disposed of. But very few companies do that thoroughly, even if they do brand their products as \"green\", Beckman says.\u00a0\n\"But I will say this about vinegar. [Its] strength is its simplicity,\" Beckman says. Conventional cleaners can consist of more than a dozen different ingredients, many of them industrially manufactured in energy-consuming processes, he says. Acetic acid is born through the natural, yeast-driven fermentation of alcohol, which itself comes from the natural fermentation of sugar. The biggest environmental impact of vinegar-making is where the sugar came from \u2013 whether it's grapes, apples, grains, potatoes, or rice \u2013 which are largely renewable resources. Bockm\u00fchl cautions that this only applies to naturally fermented vinegars, the ones typically sold as food products; there are also synthetic vinegars which are derived from fossil fuels, meaning they come with all the environmentally harmful impacts of oil and gas extraction.\u00a0\u00a0\nEven at the very end of its life, vinegar has little impact. While many ingredients in soaps are tough molecules and don't easily biodegrade, sometimes continuing to kill organisms once they're in the environment, vinegar quickly breaks down, Beckman says. \"Vinegar passes muster on any sustainability scale because it's simple and it's degradable,\" he says.\u00a0\nAfter discovering all of this, I felt even better about using vinegar. I probably won't rely on it for ridding my surfaces of germs, but I'll keep using it to remove limescale and look forward to trying it out on the next rusty item I find. I'm happy to put up with the smell, knowing that I'm using a sustainable product that's likely better for my health.\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The creation of three \"dire wolf\" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.\nWhen news broke that Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based biotechnology company, had resurrected three extinct dire wolves, the internet reacted with awe. It is a species that last roamed the earth some 13,000 years ago, but has found recent fame thanks to Game of Thrones, which features fictional dire wolves.\nThe story was stoked further when a photograph of Game of Thrones author George R R Martin holding one of the adorable white pups was released. \"I have to say the rebirth of the direwolf has stirred me as no scientific news has since Neil Armstrong [walked] on the moon,\" Martin wrote on his blog.\nMartin, who is an investor in Colossal, added that more extinct species were on the way, including the woolly mammoth, Tasmanian tiger and dodo.\u00a0\nColossal \u2013 which is currently valued at $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) and is backed by high-profile donors such as Chris Hemsworth, Paris Hilton and the CIA \u2013 boldly states on its website that it's \"going to fix\" the problem of extinction.\nAccording to Matt James, the company's chief animal officer, the aim is not to create a Jurassic Park-like zoo full of extinct animals, but to reintroduce lost species back into the habitats they once occupied. Once those animals are settled in, Colossal expects them to exert positive change on their habitats. \"We're trying to focus on species that can have cascading effects on an ecosystem to improve stability, lift biodiversity and maybe even help with climate change buffering,\" James tells the BBC.\u00a0\u00a0\nDe-extinction has been talked about for decades. But Colossal's three dire wolves \u2013 which are actually grey wolves that possess 20 edited genes that are meant to give them dire wolf-like features \u2013 represent the most serious effort to date to make that lofty vision a reality.\nIn the wake of the dire wolf announcement, however, many scientists have criticised Colossal's approach. They see efforts to bring back long-extinct species as costly wastes of resources and a distraction from the significant work that's needed to save still-living species.\nThe BBC spoke with several experts in fields ranging from conservation biology to paleontology about efforts to resurrect species from extinction and whether they are likely to achieve the goals that Colossal hopes.\nChief among the concerns raised was that claiming it is possible to bring back extinct species may actually lead to more existing species being lost. It could give politicians and industries the idea that damage to the environment can be fixed by resurrecting species.\nSuch a message could be particularly damaging at a time when the US is withdrawing from international agreements on climate change and revoking measures intended protect the environment and wildlife, says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and independent consultant based in Washington, DC.\n\"It's beyond irresponsible for these people [Colossal] to be claiming some sort of conservation victory in this environment,\" he says.\nThis worry was quickly reinforced when Doug Burgum, the US Secretary of the Interior \u2013 who the Colossal team met with in advance of their dire wolf announcement \u2013 praised the company's work on X as a new \"bedrock for modern species conservation\". Burgum also criticised the ineffectiveness of the \"endangered species list\" \u2013 presumably a reference to the Red List of Threatened Species, drawn up by the International Union of Conservation (IUCN) or the list of threatened & endangered species maintained by branches of the US Government \u2013 thanks to what he characterised as a focus on regulation. \"Since the dawn of our nation, it has been innovation \u2013 not regulation \u2013 that has spawned American greatness,\" he wrote.\nBiodiversity is under a seemingly endless onslaught of threats, virtually all of which are imposed by humans. The leading reasons, according to the IUCN, are habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation from fishing and hunting, illegal wildlife trade, pollution and climate change.\nColossal claims that its de-extinction work will directly benefit conservation. But the company needs to tie its work to \"ameliorating, alleviating or reversing something that's on that list\" of threats to biodiversity, says Kent Redford, former director of the Wildlife Conservation Society who now works as an independent conservation consultant in Portland, Maine.\nWhile Colossal's de-extinction work is \"super-cool science,\" he continues, he does not see it alleviating any of the threats highlighted by the IUCN.\nColossal sees things otherwise. The company states on its website that woolly mammoths reintroduced to the Arctic, for example, will increase those habitats' resilience to climate change through their foraging behavior, which they say will help to keep carbon locked in permafrost in the ground. By scraping away snow, the company says, mammoths will expose the soil below to cold air, causing it to stay frozen.\u00a0\nHowever, Nitin Sekar, a conservation scientist with the Asian elephant specialist group at the IUCN, says he has struggled to find evidence in the scientific literature to support this claim. One study comparing carbon storage in the Arctic tundra to taiga forest found the soil in areas covered in trees could store nearly twice as much carbon overall. Only slightly more was found in the permafrost of the tundra than in the taiga. Nor could he find anything else about how mammoths might have affected carbon in general.\nSome research on existing species of arctic herbivores suggests that they can reduce permafrost thawing. One scoping study by researchers at the University of Oxford does point to the role mammoths had on the climate during the Pleistocene and suggests bison and horses could replicate some of that role. But those species need to be maintained at high densities \u2013 where they are fenced, fed and managed by humans \u2013 to have any protective effect. The Arctic ecosystem is also different today than it was in the Pleistocene, so it is also hard to say whether mammoth hybrids would have that same effect on today's landscape as species like caribou and reindeer.\nThere could be other ways that mammoths affect carbon levels. As temperatures increase, the act of trampling and scraping away snow could actually accelerate permafrost melting by exposing it to the Sun \u2013 an effect that some research suggests is already happening in wet lowlands in the Arctic.\u00a0\n\"Overall, with the data we have now, it's just impossible to know how mammoths affected their environment millennia ago, or how the mammoth-elephant hybrids will behave in our warmer future,\" Sekar says. \"It seems like a strange thing to gamble on in the face of an existential crisis, given the alternatives.\"\u00a0\nJames calls for more research to resolve these questions and show \"direct links and causation in a way that can help to bring the rest of the scientific community along on this journey\".\nDire wolves and woolly mammoths were driven extinct by the complex forces of a changing planet, not just by human activities. For species that humans are responsible for annihilating, though, simply bringing them back does not help to address the threats that pushed them to extinction in the first place, says Corinne Kendall, programme director for Southern Africa at the Peregrine Fund, a non-profit organisation that aims to conserve birds of prey around the world.\nModern conservationists recognise this and are increasingly focused on landscape-level solutions rather than saving a particular favourite species, Kendall adds.\n\"That's what's missing in the way Colossal is approaching this,\" she says. \"If you only address the genetics and technology side of things, it's interesting from a scientific discovery standpoint, but you're creating the trees without the forest.\"\nJulie Meachen, a vertebrate paleontologist and morphologist at Des Moines University in Iowa, believes, however, that the genetic techniques Colossal used to create its dire wolves are applicable to conservation. The company is also exploring ways to help still-living species such as the northern white rhino, elephants and endangered pigeons, she points out. \"These techniques could be applied to any species suffering from genetic diversity loss and to combat inbreeding or genetic bottlenecks in low population sizes,\" she says.\n\"I think the conservation work that Colossal is doing is far more important than the de-extinction work, but this conservation work does not get the same press coverage as the flashy de-extinction part,\" she adds. \"That is unfortunate.\"\nJames at Colossal agrees that de-extinction technologies are just \"one piece of a very complex puzzle\" that must also include things like habitat protection. But he says that attention-grabbing headlines about extinct species being brought back to life can act like \"a giant ship\" pulling \"all these other projects in its wake\".\u00a0\nIt is also important to be clear about what Colossal is actually able to achieve. It is unlikely to ever be possible to truly resurrect long-gone species like dire wolves or woolly mammoths, say scientists not involved with the company. Tissue samples from animals that have been extinct for tens of thousands of years lack the intact cells needed for traditional cloning techniques, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. \"What Colossal is engaging in is genetic modification of modern species to give them physical characteristics to make them look like extinct species.\"\u00a0\nThis in itself is a significant technical achievement, argues Colossal and its supporters.\nIn the case of the dire wolves, the three puppies it managed to breed are in reality \"genetically modified grey wolves\", say researchers. Essentially the genome of modern wolves was edited to replicate small segments of ancient DNA obtained from the fossilised remains of dire wolves. They are, the company admits, grey wolves with dire wolf characteristics.\nBut scientists have even questioned some of those characteristics.It's unlikely, for example, that dire wolves would have been white, but Colossal chose to make its animals white \"because of popular conceptions from Game of Thrones\", Gill says. \"This was an aesthetic choice, not a biological or scientific one.\"\nEven if Colossal did bring back animals that very closely resembled Ice Age species, they still would not be the same as the bona fide ones that lived thousands of years ago because the Pleistocene ecosystem they inhabited no longer exists, Meachen says. \"A dire wolf or any other species is not only its genes, but also its environment and all the other species living there.\"\nColossal says it has no plans of releasing dire wolves into the wild. But it does aspire to eventually repopulate parts of the Arctic with woolly mammoths. This would require engineering a lot of baby mammoth proxies, which the company plans to do by using Asian or African elephants as surrogates.\nIn the West especially, though, some people are starting to question the ethics of whether elephants \u2013 extremely intelligent, social and sentient beings \u2013 should be kept in captivity at all, much less be experimented on, Sekar says. Asian elephants in modern zoo facilities also frequently suffer from infertility and lose their calves to stillbirths and infanticides twice as often as elephants in semi-wild conditions, he says, while mothers deeply mourn dead calves. \"Are we really ok putting elephants through that so we can have these visually entertaining animals that aren't even real mammoths?\" asks Sekar.\nJames says that Colossal will have many quality control steps to ensure things go well for the elephants, and that the company will also be working with leading animal welfare experts to \"avoid potential welfare pitfalls ahead\".\u00a0\nColossal has not disclosed how much it invested in the dire wolf programme \u2013 but it's likely in the many millions of dollars. While costs of new technologies do eventually go down with scale, even if de-extinction does get cheaper, it will still be orders of magnitude more affordable and effective to stop species from going extinct in the first place, Shiffman says. Moreover, if the original drivers of extinction are not addressed, then de-extinct species could quickly become re-extinct, he warns.\nWhile Redford acknowledges that money is not fungible, if Colossal's primary goal really is conservation, then he says he has a hard time viewing its work on de-extinction as being \"the right investment to make\".\nFor every extinct species that Colossal is bringing back, however, James says the company is also investing in a surviving endangered species. Work is being done to introduce greater genetic diversity to populations of endangered red wolves in the US, for example, and to engineer elephants to be resistant to herpes virus.\u00a0\nBut while red wolves do have some issues with genetic diversity, their biggest threats are road collisions and human persecution, Kendall says. Without addressing \"how the animal is going to survive on the ground\", the genetic component becomes \"kind of irrelevant\".\u00a0\nHerpes also only kills a fraction of the number of wild Asian elephants each year compared to those killed by humans, says Sekar, , who has reviewed data from the Indian government about causes of elephant deaths. Around two wild elephants are known to die per year of herpes compared to around 100 killed in some way by humans, he says.\u00a0\nColossal could leverage its synthetic biology expertise in ways that are clear wins for the planet, experts say. Crops that are engineered to more efficiently take up nitrogen, for example, could be a huge boon for reducing the steep climate costs of nitrogen fertiliser and lessening the major dead zones that its runoffs cause in water bodies. Finding ways to engineer high quality animal proteins for human consumption could, likewise, be a game-changer for alleviating the many environmental and animal welfare concerns that plague the livestock industry, the experts say.\u00a0\n\"Colossal clearly has very talented biologists on their team,\" Sekar says. \"If they were to turn their attention to addressing problems like that, they could really be the heroes of conservation.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Alex Yee is making his London Marathon debut 10 years after completing the Mini London Marathon for a fifth time\nWhen Alex Yee sits down for post-race dim sum with his family on Sunday, it will represent a poignant full-circle moment.\nThat was the reward Yee, who has Chinese heritage on his father's side, recalls provided the main motivation to run - and twice place third in - the Mini London Marathon as a child.\nIt was not long before the spectacle of the London Marathon captured his imagination and he nagged his parents to help him peer over the barriers for a closer look at the elites.\nBut on Sunday it is Yee, the reigning Olympic and world triathlon champion, whom hundreds of thousands of spectators will hope to catch a glimpse of as he embraces the unknown on the streets of his home city.\n\"As time went on I realised the excitement of the London Marathon, the impact it had and how momentous a day it was,\" Yee tells BBC Sport before his debut over 26.2 miles.\n\"I'm not thinking past the experience but afterwards I'd definitely like to get some dim sum with my family and have that deja vu moment,\" he adds, 10 years on from his last mini marathon.\nThere are certainly less demanding challenges the 27-year-old could have undertaken to provide the mental refresh he sought after a career-defining year. \nBut after capturing triathlon's two biggest prizes fewer than 12 weeks apart, ending his world title wait in October after his spectacular recovery on the banks of the River Seine clinched Olympic gold in Paris in the summer, Yee knew where he wanted to set his sights next.\nNot that he expected his coach to agree to his left-field suggestion.\n\"Definitely not. It's been something I've asked every single year, but it never really made sense,\" says Yee, the most decorated Olympic triathlete in history.\n\"This time we were trying to think what would get me to LA [2028 Olympics] in the best place mentally and physically. It was important to freshen things up.\n\"It's been really exciting to work on my running after five years of trying to make my swim and bike an appropriate level to be competitive in triathlon. It's something I've wanted to do and I'm excited to scratch that itch.\" \nLondon Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know\n'Our daughters will be with us', say dads of Southport victims running London Marathon\nAlex Yee overturned a 15-second deficit to rival Hayden Wilde in the final 2.5km to win a dramatic Olympic men's triathlon gold at Paris 2024\nIt should be no surprise that Yee, an athlete obsessed with the process of improvement as much as the success it brings, has relished this new challenge. \nHe speaks about his first marathon training block with a beaming smile and is not ruling out another in future - although a return to triathlon is scheduled for early 2026 at the latest.\n\"To have something which has given me that purpose to get out of bed, to go out and keep searching for those fine margins, I think that's really rare to find in the first year after an Olympics when you hear of athletes soul searching and not knowing what to do,\" says Yee.\n\"To be an expert on something, you have to be once a fool. That's the way I'm seeing it. I wanted to go in with an open mind and come out the other side as a better runner - but also better holistically.\n\"It's been really interesting to learn from so many people and feel like a novice again.\"\nYee is part of a stellar elite men's field featuring 10 athletes who have run the marathon in under two hours and five minutes, including one of his sporting idols in four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge.\nThere is also Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, defending champion Alexander Mutiso Munyao, and debutant Jacob Kiplimo - who in February became the first person to run a half marathon in under 57 minutes. \nYee's target? Enjoy the experience - and go through halfway in 64 minutes and 30 seconds. \nThat would give him the chance to become only the 10th British man to run under 2:09, while only 22 have broken 2:10.\nRunning is Yee's strongest discipline and he has competed for Great Britain on the track and in cross-country, while his 5km best of 13:26 is the third-fastest ever by a British man.\n\"It would be a massive honour to, hopefully, be in that ballpark of people who have achieved amazing things,\" says Yee.\n\"I think it's going to be an amazing day for the Brits but also a historic day at the front. Hopefully I can say I was part of a sub-two hour marathon race.\"\nAlex Yee will meet Eliud Kipchoge, whose most recent London Marathon victory came in 2019, after Sunday's race\nTo Yee's astonishment, Kipchoge was among those to offer him advice and said in January that he would like to meet and help mentor the Briton when they are in London.\nSo the former mini marathon runner and Kenya's two-time Olympic champion have arranged to meet after the race.\nIn the meantime, Kipchoge, widely regarded as the greatest distance runner of all time, has offered wisdom via WhatsApp - something Yee describes as \"surreal\".\n\"His big piece of advice was to get to the start line. It sounded silly at the time, but after unfortunately seeing people forced to pull out, it's probably the strongest piece of advice of all,\" says Yee.\nThey are likely to have much to discuss. \nBoth are passionate about using the power of sport to inspire, with Yee now keen to utilise his platform as Olympic champion.\nHe intends to provide opportunities to school children through the launch of his own foundation, initially in the south London area he grew up in.\nYee also hopes documenting his marathon journey on YouTube can demonstrate that elite athletes are not \"superhuman\", before he stars on the other side of the barriers he used to watch behind. \n\"The more we share our story I feel like people realise that we're just like anyone else, and there's no reason why they can't dream to achieve what I have - or even so much more,\" says Yee.\n\"You start to feel this urgency with the fortunate position I'm in, being an Olympic champion, that I can and I want to make a difference. \n\"I'm not expecting to leave this big legacy behind.

O'Sullivan charges into last 16\nRonnie O'Sullivan has said he was \"worried\" about returning to snooker, fearing he would \"implode\" and \"have a meltdown\" in his first competitive match since January.\nO'Sullivan, 49, beat Ali Carter 10-4 on Wednesday in the first round of the World Championship, a competition he has won seven times.\nHowever, his participation in the tournament was only confirmed late last week after he went three months without playing competitively following an incident at the Championship League in January in which he snapped his cue and threw it in a bin.\n\"I lost the buzz for playing because I wasn't able to execute shots,\" said O'Sullivan. \"I was bailing out of shots. I was having to play a different game that I didn't enjoy and it didn't feel like I could express myself, so it got really tough.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan has won the World Snooker Championship seven times and is aiming to become the first man in the modern era to gain eight titles\nAsked if there were times in the past week where he thought he had made a mistake about returning to snooker, O'Sullivan said: \"Yeah, totally. \n\"I thought 'what am I doing coming here, exposing myself, [potentially] imploding out there, having a meltdown?' All that went through my head. I told [sports psychiatrist] Steve Peters that and he said 'I'm coming - I will get you through the first match'.\n\"I was quite a bit scared coming and playing. It's a daunting venue to play at anyway but it's about getting on the bike again and playing and I'm really proud that I've done that.\n\"Even if I had lost, it didn't really matter. I made that breakthrough. There's still a lot of work to do.\"\nO'Sullivan scored 583 points in five frames on Wednesday, compared with just 43 for Ali Carter\nIn Tuesday's first session against two-time Crucible finalist Carter, neither player was at their best, with it seemingly finely balanced at 5-4 to O'Sullivan.\nBut on Wednesday, 'The Rocket' was in sensational form, winning all five frames and not letting Carter score a point in four of them.\nO'Sullivan made breaks of 59, 117, 74, 123 and 131, but in the post-match news conference stressed he was trying to \"rebuild\" his technique after losing faith in his ability.\nHe said: \"I couldn't even watch myself play as I could see what was wrong. I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'.\n\"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things. I had lost all connection with the cue, the timing had gone, the touch had gone, feeling had gone. Years and years of that mounted up and it got to the point where I couldn't play and it got too much.\n\"It got to the point where I couldn't pull the cue forwards and backwards, which was quite scary.\"\nO'Sullivan beat Carter in the Crucible finals in 2008 and 2012\nFour seeded players, including world champions Kyren Wilson and Neil Robertson and last year's runner-up Jak Jones have been eliminated from O'Sullivan's half of the draw.\nChinese qualifier Pang Junxu is his opponent in the second round, although O'Sullivan said he enjoyed his Crucible return because he had not placed any expectations on himself. \n\"This game can humble you so many times,\" said O'Sullivan. \"To play one good session. It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there.\n\"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much.\n\"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\"\nCarter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday.\n\"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well.\n\"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'.\n\"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp. This boy is in that [bracket]. It's been over an extended period as well, and when he plays the cue ball sings.\n\"O'Sullivan seems in a very good place. He was born to play snooker, and when he's out there he's at peace with it.\"\nRuthless O'Sullivan cruises into Crucible last 16\nWatch: World Snooker Championship - Trump leads Zhou, Selby v Woollaston\nWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage",

        "article_text": "A young female South African doctor has sparked a nationwide conversation about a form of domestic abuse often shrouded in silence - financial abuse.\nIn a series of viral videos Dr Celiwe Ndaba opened up about how she said she had been financially exploited by her husband, how it had spiralled and led to their separation.\nOften sitting in her car on her way to work, the mother of three vlogged over two weeks about how despite her successful career she had become trapped in a toxic marriage for years, feeling manipulated to fund her husband's lifestyle - in particular his desire to drive a Mercedes Benz.\nTaking out loans for him to buy such vehicles was the \"worst decision\" of her life, putting the family under huge financial pressure, said Dr Ndaba - who since sharing her story has reverted to using her maiden name and the number of her followers has ballooned.\nDespite pleas for her husband to downgrade, she said he refused - accusing her of wanting to \"turn him into a laughing stock by making him drive a small car\".\nThe medic said she was speaking out as she wanted to issue a warning to others - that it was not only \"uneducated\" and \"less fortunate\" women who find themselves in abusive relationships.\nHer estranged husband, Temitope Dada, has not responded to a BBC request for comment.\nIn the wake of the social media storm, he set up a TikTok account, where in one of his first videos he acknowledged: \"You may know me as\u2026 'Mr Benz or nothing.'\"\nThe few posts he has made are accompanied by hashtags such as #divorcetrauma - saying the accusations are lies.\nNonetheless, the comments section on Dr Ndaba's TikTok and other social media platforms have transformed into support groups, filled with female breadwinners sharing eerily similar stories.\n\"You are brave to speak out so publicly\u2026 I have been suffering in silence,\" one person commented.\nBertus Preller, a lawyer based in Cape Town, believes this is because although South African women are becoming doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs, getting well-paid jobs does not necessarily free them from the clutches of the patriarchy.\nWomen's financial independence clashes with \"cultural norms that prioritise male authority\", he says.\nIf anything, their success appears to make them targets.\nFinancial abuse occurs when one partner dominates or exploits the other's financial resources, the lawyer explains.\n\"It is a subtle yet potent tactic of domestic violence, aimed at keeping the victim under control,\" he says.\nIn South Africa, this is legally classified as economic abuse under the Domestic Violence Act.\nMr Preller says things like \"unjustly withholding money for essentials or interfering with shared assets,\" are covered by the act.\nA university lecturer, who requested anonymity, told the BBC how her husband had lied about his qualifications and eventually left her in financial ruin.\nIt started with her car that he mostly drove but never refuelled. Then loans she took out for his multiple failed business ventures. Finally, there came an eviction notice as she said he had stopped contributing towards rent, leaving her to shoulder all the expenses for their family, which included three children.\nDespite this, they stayed together for close to a decade - even though he was also physically abusive.\n\"He's very smart... I was in love with his smartness, his big dreams. But he couldn't follow them up with actions. His pride was his downfall,\" she said.\nEven when he managed to get some money, he still did not contribute.\n\"He started withholding whatever money he had for himself. He'd go out drinking with his friends, come back - the salary is gone,\" she said.\nLegal financial expert Somila Gogoba says that beyond the control of money, financial abuse often has deep psychological roots.\n\"For the abuser, this behaviour may stem from feelings of inadequacy, fear of abandonment, or the need for dominance,\" she told the BBC.\n\"For the victim, the psychological impact includes feelings of worthlessness, fear, and dependence, which can be paralysing.\"\nResearch from the University of South Africa suggests these are not isolated cases \u2013 and that women who out-earn their partners face significantly higher risks of intimate partner violence.\nOut of their in-depth study of 10 women who were the primary breadwinners of their families, only two were married.\n\"For eight of the participants, their choice of being single resulted from their experiences of physical, emotional and sexual violence\u2026 All the women said they believed that their role as female breadwinners was viewed as threatening to the traditional male role of a provider,\" said researcher Bianca Parry.\nMs Gogoba says female breadwinners are less valued than their male counterparts, despite their economic contributions: \"This cultural backdrop can encourage some partners to feel entitled to control the finances, even when they do not contribute equally.\n\"This control is not just about money - it is also about power and maintaining a grip on the relationship dynamics.\"\nNombulelo Shange, sociologist lecturer at the University of the Free State, says it is part of a growing pattern in South Africa of middle-class women being financially exploited.\n\"Black women face a double patriarchy: Western expectations at work, traditional expectations at home. When these collide, harmful ideologies escalate,\" she told the BBC.\nShe explained that balancing the pressures of being a successful woman, but playing the role of \"the caregiver, the mother, the good wife, the good neighbour and community member who goes to church every Sunday\", was difficult as women were always taught to tiptoe around men's egos.\nSince Dr Ndaba's revelations, women on social media have shared stories of giving their male partners their debit or credit cards when they go out to eat so it appears as though he is paying for the meal.\nFor Ms Shange this shows how the burden of a happy home is often placed on the woman's shoulders.\n\"You think: 'If I just get them a car, they'll be happy.' Love makes you blind. When your person struggles, you struggle too - you want to fix it,\" she said.\nBy the time the university lecturer divorced her husband, she was left with debts of 140,000 rand ($7,500; \u00a35,600) - all racked up in her name.\n\"Before, I could plan things like holidays. Now they are a luxury,\" she said.\nDr Ndaba has been at pains to tell her followers, as she did on one vlog: \"Finance is an important aspect of people's marriages.\"\nThe lecturer could not agree more, urging young women to take their time when getting to know their partners and have open, honest conversations.\n\"Talk about the finances, talk about your background, talk about emotions and character.\"\nMs Gogoba urged more people to protect themselves from their partner, telling them to keep a separate bank account, keep their pins secure and monitor their credit cards.\nThey all agreed that women should understand that love should not come with an unsustainable price tag.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he \"was dead\" in the immediate aftermath.\nThe England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.\nSpeaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\".\n\"I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,\" he recalled.\n\"I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?\n\"My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.\"\nFlintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his \"biggest fear\" was that he no longer had a face left.\n\"I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\"\nHe recalled being in \"agony\" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.\nThe incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\nHe was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.\nSpeaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.\n\"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.\n\"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\"\nSurgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.\nHe \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said.\nMr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.\nReflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he \"didn't think I had it in me to get through\" the ordeal.\n\"This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,\" he added.\n\"I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...\n\"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\"\nOne of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.\nFlintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery. \n\"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\"\nThe 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.\nThe acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.\nHe also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.\nIn 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.\nThe documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",

        "article_text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he will step back from his role with the Trump administration's cost-cutting team known as Doge. \nThose at the White House, including the president, have said it has long been the plan that Musk would soon step away, but the news came as the billionaire's car business saw earnings plunge. \nMusk's announcement left many unanswered questions, including when he will  actually leave the administration and what will happen to Doge, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency.\nWhen asked by the BBC on Wednesday, President Donald Trump reinforced the message that the administration was preparing for Musk's departure. \n\"We have to, at some point, let him go and do that. We expected to be doing it about this time. I'll talk to Elon about it,\" Trump said at the White House.\nThe president also said Tesla will \"be taken care of\" once Musk returns and alleged that Musk was being \"treated very unfairly, I guess, by some of the public\".\n\"He's a great patriot, and [that] should have never happened to him,\" Trump added.\nHowever, under government rules, spending fewer days at Doge could actually prolong Musk's stint in government.\nMusk has been designated a \"special government employee\" (SGE) \u2013 a label that allows him to work at a paid or unpaid government job for 130 days each year.\nAccording to a 2007 Department of Justice memo, cited in an October 2024 guidance document from the Office of Government Ethics, any day on which an SGE performs any work for the government counts as a full day towards that limit.\nMeasured from Trump's inauguration on 20 January, the 130-day limit - assuming Musk, who brags about working weekends, clocks roughly five days a week at Doge - would run out toward the end of May.\nBut scaling back would extend that timeframe. Additionally, the 130-day limit would reset in January 2026.\nMusk has not given details on his intended schedule. He made the announcement on Tuesday, after Tesla reported financial troubles including a 71% drop in profits. \nThe drop came after repeated \"Tesla takedown\" protests across the globe and calls for boycotts against the car manufacturer amid Musk's government role. While organisers have said most protests have been peaceful, some have been destructive with fires set at Tesla showrooms or at charging stations. \nThe company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand for the vehicles. \nMusk told investors on an earnings call that the time he allocates to Doge \"will drop significantly\" and that he would be \"allocating far more of my time to Tesla\". \nAfter the comments, Tesla's languishing stock price rose.\nIt's also unclear how many days Musk has already worked for the government, whether the government is keeping a tally, and how the limit would be enforced. \nThere has been criticism that the Trump administration may have flouted government rules in creating Musk's unprecedented role, and concerns that he may not follow the time limit.\nUnder rules for SGEs, Musk would have to undergo ethics training, provide a confidential financial disclosure statement, and avoid conflicts of interest. \nHis corporate empire includes large companies that do business with the US government and foreign governments, including SpaceX, which has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive.\nThe rules also prohibit special government employees from partisan activities, including wearing clothing with political slogans, while in government offices or carrying out official duties. Musk has been pictured wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat in the Oval Office.\nStill, in February, an anonymous White House official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Musk would file a confidential financial disclosure at some point, and had been given an ethics briefing.\nThe following month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the BBC: \"Elon Musk is selflessly serving President Trump's administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"\nFor now, Musk appears to serve at Trump's behest, with no clear oversight other than the president himself.\nIn a report released last week, progressive think-tank Public Citizen criticised the Trump administration and said the White House was \"wildly abusing\" the SGE rules.\n\"Right now, the public has no way to know whether SGEs like Musk who don't file public financial disclosure reports or are permitted to oversee themselves are putting the people's interests ahead of their own,\" said report author Jon Golinger.\nThe BBC has contacted Musk and the Office of Personnel Management - the agency overseeing special government employees, and one where Doge employees have reportedly taken over several functions - for comment.\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that around 100 Doge employees would remain in various government departments after Musk departs this year. \nMusk and Trump set a deadline for Doge to finish its work, which corresponds to the 250th anniversary of the signing of the US Declaration of Independence.\nThe executive order setting up Doge, signed by Trump on Inauguration Day in January, mentioned 4 July 2026 as the ending date.\nEarlier, in December, Musk responded to a tweet that also said Doge would finish entirely on that date.\n\"The final step of DOGE is to delete itself,\" he wrote.",

        "summary": "I'll talk to Elon about it,\" Trump said at the White House.The president also said Tesla will \"be taken care of\" once Musk returns and alleged that Musk was being \"treated very unfairly, I guess, by some of the public\". Musk told investors on an earnings call that the time he allocates to Doge \"will drop significantly\" and that he would be \"allocating far more of my time to Tesla\". \"He's a great patriot, and [that] should have never happened to him,\" Trump added.However, under government rules, spending fewer days at Doge could actually prolong Musk's stint in government.Musk has been designated a \"special government employee\" (SGE) \u2013 a label that allows him to work at a paid or unpaid government job for 130 days each year.According to a 2007 Department of Justice memo, cited in an October 2024 guidance document from the Office of Government Ethics, any day on which an SGE performs any work for the government counts as a full day towards that limit.Measured from Trump's inauguration on 20 January, the 130-day limit - assuming Musk, who brags about working weekends, clocks roughly five days a week at Doge - would run out toward the end of May.But scaling back would extend that timeframe. After the comments, Tesla's languishing stock price rose.Watch: Trump says he would 'love to keep' Musk working in his administrationIt's also unclear how many days Musk has already worked for the government, whether the government is keeping a tally, and how the limit would be enforced. Opposition to Musk's political activities has dragged down the company's financial performanceThe following month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the BBC: \"Elon Musk is selflessly serving President Trump's administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws.",

The state now only trails Germany, China and the US as a whole.\n\"California isn't just keeping pace with the world - we're setting the pace,\" Newsom said.\nThe new figures come as Newsom has spoken out against President Donald Trump's tariffs and voiced concern about the future of the state's economy. \nCalifornia has the largest share of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US. It is also home to leading technological innovation, the centre of the world's entertainment industry and the country's two largest seaports. \nNewsom, a prominent Democrat and possible presidential candidate in 2028, filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's authority to impose the levies, which have caused disruption to global markets and trade. \nTrump has enacted 10% levies on almost all countries importing to the US, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. \nAnother 25% tariff was imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy. \nTrump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products.\nHis administration said last week that when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nNewsom noted his worries about the future of the state's economy. \n\"While we celebrate this success, we recognise that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration,\" he said. \"California's economy powers the nation, and it must be protected.\"\nTrump has argued his trade war is only levelling the playing field after years of the US being taken advantage of. \nThe tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. It is one major pillar of his economic agenda, as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.\nThe new data shows California's GDP behind the US at $29.18 trillion, China at $18.74 trillion and Germany at $4.65 trillion. It also shows California was the fastest growing among those countries.\nJapan's economy is under pressure because of its decreasing and ageing population, which means its workforce is shrinking and social care costs are ballooning. \nThis week, the IMF cut its economic growth forecast for Japan and projected that  the central bank would raise interest rates more slowly than previously expected because of the impact of higher tariffs.\n\"The effect of tariffs announced on April 2 and associated uncertainty offset the expected strengthening of private consumption with above-inflation wage growth boosting household disposable income,\" its World Economic Outlook report said.",

It's going to be be tough for everyone because people have grown up watching him. It will take some getting used to not having him around the club.\"\nVardy has scored 198 times in 496 appearances for the Foxes since his \u00a31m move from Fleetwood in 2012, showing the quality that led to appearances at Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. \nEven before their memorable and miraculous title achievement, though, he helped Leicester to their 'Great Escape' in the 2014-15 campaign where they won seven of their last nine games to avoid relegation under Nigel Pearson. \nVardy scored goals in the Champions League and Europa League, and won the Premier League's Golden Boot in 2019-20 after scoring 23 times - the oldest to win the prize at the age of 33.\nHe also beat current Foxes boss Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of scoring in consecutive Premier League games when he netted in his 11th straight match against Manchester United in 2015.\nVardy was Leicester's leading light and the influential figure they turned to, and could rely on, in times of need.\nAfter relegation in 2023, he scored 20 times in all competitions last season as they won the Championship and, amid Leicester's troubles in this campaign, he is their top scorer with eight goals.\nIt's no surprise he was on target when they last scored at home in the league on 8 December against Brighton. They have since failed to do so in nine successive matches at the King Power, setting an unwanted top-flight record and a major reason why they are second bottom in the table and 18 points adrift of safety.\nWinger Albrighton played with Vardy for 10 years after he moved to Leicester from Aston Villa on a free transfer in 2014, and they formed a tight bond on and off the pitch.\nThere is a view of Vardy, especially from opposition fans, as a wind-up merchant who takes delight in responding to abuse and gestures aplenty.\nA central figure in the dressing room too, players also have a pre-conceived opinion of him.\nBut that changes once they meet him as Albrighton, 35, revealed: \"He's a very unique character, very unique. There's nobody who came into the dressing room that was anything like him. I had a great relationship with him so he's always been fantastic with me. \n\"The way he is with everybody in the dressing room was incredible. New signings would come in with a perception of him and they'd quickly find out the true character behind his personality. \n\"He is a down-to-earth person, very, very humble, just normal. People make out he is some sort of a superstar, but he's just normal. \n\"He likes the normal things, the simple things in life, he's a family man and is just an all-round good person, he'll do anything for you.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWhen Vardy broke Van Nistelrooy's Premier League record\nAs the last player still left at the club, Vardy is also the remaining link to Leicester's title-winning squad and his departure will signal a new era.\nThe Foxes need a reset after relegation, with Van Nistelrooy's future in doubt after 17 defeats in 22 games during his five months in charge.\nVardy, and goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, are the only players out of contract in the summer, meaning Leicester will need to work to move others on. \nThe forward's reported \u00a3140,000-a-week wages would have dropped to around \u00a3100,000-a-week in the Championship, so it will free up much-needed money.\nMore changes are expected off the pitch too, with fans demanding the dismissal of director of football Jon Rudkin.\nBut the club's future is uncertain, with the possibility of sanctions from the EFL following the club's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) breach in the three years up to the 2022-23 campaign. \nLeicester escaped a points deduction after successfully arguing they were not a top-flight club at the time of the charge, but the EFL could move, once they are officially a Championship club and transfer their Premier League share to one of the promoted sides.\nLeicester's financial situation could also have been a consideration on whether to extend Vardy's contract.\nJamie Vardy had a good relationship with boss Dean Smith at Leicester\nVardy, who will turn 39 next January, wants to keep on playing and there will be no shortage of takers at home or abroad.\nHe said: \"This isn't retirement. I want to keep playing and doing what I enjoy doing most, scoring goals. Hopefully there's one or two more for Leicester between now and the end of the season and many more in the future.\n\"I may be 38 but I've still got the desire and ambition to achieve so much more.\"\nHis wages are likely to be out of reach for any Championship club, even those with the deepest pockets, so he will need to take a significant cut.\nWrexham had already been mentioned as a possible destination before the announcement and their rise, from the National League to within two wins of a Championship place, is similar to Vardy's own personal journey.\nHe will surely have interest from Major League Soccer and enjoyed a strong relationship with Charlotte FC boss Dean Smith during his time in charge of the Foxes two years ago.\nSmith tried to sign Vardy last summer and could well reignite that interest.\nCharlotte are top of the Eastern Conference, while Vardy's former team-mate and fellow title winner Christian Fuchs is also one of Smith's assistants.\nSmith said in August: \"I did text him and see if he wanted to come over to America, but I knew that was going to be hard once he took Leicester back to the Premier League.\"\nThere could also be interest from Saudi Arabia, but his family will be a factor in any future destination as Vardy and wife Rebekah share five children.\nBut, as the Foxes icon looks to script another chapter in his career and life, football may never see a story like his and Leicester's again.",

The 38-year-old's impending departure from the King Power Stadium is a perfect example of how the club is now at a crossroads following their relegation.Their talisman, a force of nature up front at his peak, grew with the club and was the beating heart of their story - a fairy tale encapsulated by the 2016 title triumph that defied all odds.So what next for Vardy and Leicester?Recap the reaction, analysis and your views as Vardy to leave LeicesterVardy to leave Leicester at end of the seasonPublished19 hours ago'A club at a crossroads' - relegated Leicester in need of rebuildPublished4 days ago'People make out he is some sort of a superstar, but he's just normal'\"He is obviously the greatest ever Leicester player,\" former team-mate Marc Albrighton told BBC Sport. Vardy scored goals in the Champions League and Europa League, and won the Premier League's Golden Boot in 2019-20 after scoring 23 times - the oldest to win the prize at the age of 33.He also beat current Foxes boss Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of scoring in consecutive Premier League games when he netted in his 11th straight match against Manchester United in 2015.Vardy was Leicester's leading light and the influential figure they turned to, and could rely on, in times of need.After relegation in 2023, he scored 20 times in all competitions last season as they won the Championship and, amid Leicester's troubles in this campaign, he is their top scorer with eight goals.It's no surprise he was on target when they last scored at home in the league on 8 December against Brighton.",

While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen their sales soar.\nIt has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government \"for a very, very long time\", arguing the rule had had devastating impact \"on our retail landscape and our high streets\".\nHe joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.\nUK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they keep to.\nAside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.\nThe so called \"de mimimis\" rule has received renewed interest after US president Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure in America amid his escalating trade war with China. \nGoods worth less than $800 into the US will soon be subject to charges, where they were previously exempt.

'Absolute nonsense'Mr Paphitis told the BBC it was \"absolute nonsense\" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was \"more critical now\" due to a \"rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market\".The British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. Goods worth less than $800 into the US will soon be subject to charges, where they were previously exempt.",

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.\nThe fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously. \n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

That is ultimately why I am running the race, to make Rob proud.\"\nRob's MND diagnosis came two years after he retired from a stellar 17-year career at Leeds Rhinos, during which he made almost 500 appearances and won 13 trophies. \nWith the help of former team-mate and close friend Kevin Sinfield, they raised more than \u00a315 million for MND charities as Rob battled the disease himself. Both men were awarded CBEs in the 2024 New Year Honours.\n\"Rob will will be at the forefront of my mind.

Trump has previously blamed Ukraine for starting the war and has accused Zelensky multiple times of being an obstacle to peace negotiations. \nBut the White House struck a more positive tone about Saturday's meeting, while Zelensky described the sit down as a \"very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results\".\nTwo images were released of the meeting, showing the US leader in a blue suit and Ukrainian president in a black top and trousers, sitting opposite each other in intense conversation.\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also posted an image of the meeting on X with the caption: \"No words are needed to describe the importance of this historic meeting. Two leaders working for peace in St. Peter's Basilica.\"\nAnother image posted by the Ukrainian delegation from inside St Peter's showed the two men standing alongside British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and France's Emmanuel Macron, his hand on Zelensky's shoulder. \nThe implication was that the prime minister and French president had helped to bring the two together, against the sombre backdrop of the funeral.\nAfter the meeting, Trump and Zelensky walked down the steps of the basilica, where Zelensky's arrival was met with applause from the crowds, and took their seats in the front row. \nDuring the service, the pair sat a short distance from each other, with Macron and other heads of state in between.\nIn his homily, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re spoke of Pope Francis's incessant calls for peace. \"'Build bridges, not walls' was an exhortation he repeated many times,\" said the cardinal.\nUkrainian officials had talked of a possible second meeting but Trump's motorcade drove away from St Peter's immediately afterwards and his plane left Rome a short time later.\nZelensky however later met Macron in the garden of Villa Bonaparte, home to the French embassy to the Holy See, and Sir Keir at Zelensky and Starmer together too at Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador's residence. He also met EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\nIn a post on X, Macron said ending the war in Ukraine was an objective that \"we share in common with President Trump\", adding that Ukraine was ready for \"an unconditional ceasefire\".\nA Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer and Zelensky discussed the positive progress that had been made recently to \"secure a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,\" adding that the pair had agreed to \"maintain momentum\" and \"speak again at the earliest opportunity\".\nDuring February's heated White House exchange, Trump accused the Ukrainian president of \"gambling with World War Three\" by not going along with ceasefire plans led by Washington.\nKyiv has been on the receiving end of growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of an agreement with Moscow to end the war.\nThese concessions would reportedly include giving up large portions of land, including the Crimean peninsula which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.\nZelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea in the past. He suggested to the BBC on Friday that \"a full and unconditional ceasefire opens up the possibility to discuss everything\".",

        "article_text": "Wrexham will play in the second tier of English football for only the second time in their history\nThe party at the Stok Cae Ras was in full swing on Saturday night as Wrexham sealed an unprecedented third successive promotion.\nWycombe Wanderers' 1-0 loss to Leyton Orient earlier in the day paved the way for Phil Parkinson's side to open up an unassailable advantage over the chasing pack in League One if they could beat Charlton Athletic.\nIt was an opportunity they grasped as Ollie Rathbone scored his eighth goal of the campaign before Sam Smith netted a brace to clinch an emphatic 3-0 win.\nBBC Sport Wales looks at how Wrexham made the journey to the Championship from non-league in just three seasons - and explores what the future may hold.\nOllie Rathbone scored Wrexham's opener in their 3-0 victory against Charlton Athletic\nWorking as a writer on comedy television series Mythic Quest, current Wrexham director Humphrey Ker became a close personal friend of the show's co-creator Rob McElhenney.\nThe Philadelphia-born actor took an interest in football and, during the coronavirus pandemic, tasked Ker with assessing potential investment options.\nHartlepool, Aldershot, Carlisle and Shamrock Rovers fans, look away now. They were among the clubs that were explored before Wrexham were chosen.\nAnd a chance encounter on Instagram proved to be the start of a dream partnership.\nDeadpool star Ryan Reynolds contacted McElhenney on the social media platform to praise him for his acting skills in a particular episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\nThe duo struck up a relationship and the rest, as they say, is history.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast prior to the win over Charlton, Ker said: \"They (Reynolds and McElhenney) came to understand this thing about the way our football system works that is completely alien in America, which is the idea that you can go from the top to the bottom and from the bottom to the top. In America, it's kind of a closed circuit.\"\nThe Hollywood pair completed their takeover of Wrexham in February 2021, making an immediate \u00a32m investment after taking control from the club's supporters' trust.\nWrexham won the 2022-23 National League title to return to the Football League for the first time since 2008\nWrexham have not finished below second place in the various divisions they have competed in any of their four seasons under Phil Parkinson, who was appointed as manager just five months after the takeover was finalised.\nSemi-final play-off heartache against Grimsby Town brought an abrupt end to an impressive debut campaign in north Wales for Parkinson in 2021-22.\nBut the following season proved memorable as Wrexham clinched the National League title with a record 111 points to end a 15-year absence from the Football League.\nAnd there has been no stopping the Red Dragons since.\nWrexham won 26 of their 46 matches en route to taking the runner-up spot in League Two as the club sealed back-to-back promotions last term.\nDespite another step up in level, Wrexham have successfully gone toe to toe with a number of former Premier League sides to take the second and final automatic promotion place in League One this season.\nCharlton was Parkinson's 181st league match in charge of Wrexham, and his record is nothing short of remarkable.\nWrexham have triumphed in 112 of Parkinson's league games. Their win rate is just shy of 62%. There have been 40 draws and only 29 league defeats.\nAcross this period, Wrexham have scored 361 league goals (not including play-offs) at a rate of almost exactly two per game while claiming an average of 2.08 points per game.\nParkinson, 57, also guided Wrexham to the FA Trophy final - they lost to Bromley at Wembley - in his first season and has twice led his side to the fourth round of the FA Cup.\n\"Phil Parkinson, our manager, deserves an\u00a0unbelievable\u00a0amount of credit because there have been other teams that have had more resources than us in the past that have not been able to get to the cusp that we have got to,\" said Ker.\nRob McElhenney (left) and Ryan Reynolds are co-chairmen of Wrexham\nThe 'Welcome to Wrexham' television documentary has been at the heart of the club's rise to global prominence over recent seasons.\nSeason four is set to premiere in May and will detail the club's journey from League One to the Championship, with Wrexham becoming the first side in the top five divisions of English football to secure three successive promotions.\nWhile Wrexham do not earn money directly from the show, its popularity has had a significant impact on improving the club's revenue streams.\n\"It's extraordinary. We often talk about the power of storytelling,\" said Ker.\n\"What we've been able to do with the documentary and the football club\u00a0is tell people in America why football is so significant to us, what it means and what\u00a0the stakes are. \n\"Truly, I'm astonished by the volume of interest. It's because America is fascinated by English football and we are a way in for a lot of people who don't follow it in other ways.\"\nTelling the story of the local community in addition to the fortunes of the club itself, the documentary has won eight Primetime Emmy Awards and two Critics' Choice Television Awards.\n\"We're telling\u00a0that\u00a0story, and we're telling the story of the town,\" added Ker.\n\"The amazing thing about all football clubs is that so much life happens around them, and covering that is what we do.\"\nFrom non-league to brink of Premier League: Wrexham's Hollywood timeline\nWrexham clinch promotion with bumper Charlton win\nReynolds takes selfies with fans before crunch game\n\"Our goal is to grow the team, establish Wrexham AFC as a Premier League club, in front of increased attendances at an improved stadium while making a positive difference to the wider community in Wrexham.\"\nThe club's mission statement spells out the scale of the ambition of co-chairmen McElhenney and Reynolds.\nAnd Wrexham's hierarchy have plenty to ponder as they plan for the club's first season in the second tier since 1981-82.\nTheir squad size will rise from 22 players to 25, while matchday squads will feature nine substitutes as opposed to seven.\nIt could, in theory, pave the way for Paul Mullin's return to the squad following his absence over the previous 13 games. \nWhatever striker Mullin's situation, it is clear there is further work to be done on the squad, as Parkinson will want to bring in more players of a higher calibre to bolster his side's Championship prospects.\nThe inevitable acquisitions will lead to an increased wage bill, with Ker recently suggesting Wrexham would need to quadruple their wage outgoings to be competitive in the Championship. \nWork is also due to commence on improving the iconic Kop Stand at their Stok Cae Ras home, while there are plans to develop a training ground and for expansion of facilities for the academy and women's side.\nIt all requires money - and lots of it. But on the plus side, the club are currently operating with a model most EFL clubs will envy.\nThe \u00a326.7m Wrexham made in revenue during their 2023-24 League Two season puts them just below the top Championship sides - who benefit from parachute payments - in terms of income.\nTV and sponsorship revenue will only increase in the Championship, so there is no doubt Wrexham are well placed at present. \nThe next challenge is always the toughest, and the Championship is a different beast from what Wrexham have face over the past few years.\nBut with such impressive alignment from top to bottom at the club, Wrexham know they are in a strong position to achieve their ultimate goal at some stage - whether it be next season or beyond.",

They were among the clubs that were explored before Wrexham were chosen.And a chance encounter on Instagram proved to be the start of a dream partnership.Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds contacted McElhenney on the social media platform to praise him for his acting skills in a particular episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.The duo struck up a relationship and the rest, as they say, is history.Speaking on BBC Breakfast prior to the win over Charlton, Ker said: \"They (Reynolds and McElhenney) came to understand this thing about the way our football system works that is completely alien in America, which is the idea that you can go from the top to the bottom and from the bottom to the top.",

It's not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary,\" he said in response to questions from the BBC.\nBut the 53-year-old former boxing champion-turned politician stressed that the Ukrainian people would \"never accept occupation\" by Russia.\nHe was speaking hours after a Russian missile-and-drone attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured more than 80.\nIt was one of the deadliest Russian assaults on the Ukrainian capital in months.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\nKlitschko is now one of the most senior Ukrainian politicians to indicate publicly that his country may have to give up territory, albeit temporarily.\nThe Kyiv mayor and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are political opponents. The mayor has repeatedly accused the president and his team of trying to undermine his authority.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme from his office in central Kyiv on Thursday, Klitschko noted that he was \"responsible for the capital of Ukraine\", describing it as \"the heart\" of the war-torn country.\nHe said Zelensky might be forced to take a \"painful solution\" to achieve peace. \nWhen asked whether Zelensky has been discussing with him any details of a possible settlement, Klitschko replied bluntly: \"No.\"\n\"President Zelensky does [it] himself. It's not my function,\" he added.\nReferring to a very public bust-up between Zelensky and Trump at the White House in February, the mayor suggested that key issues between top politicians would be better discussed \"without video cameras\".\nEarlier this week, Trump accused Zelensky of harming peace negotiations, after the Ukrainian leader again ruled out recognising Russian control of Crimea, a southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014.\nTrump has said \"Crimea will stay with Russia\", in an interview with Time magazine on Friday, having previously said the peninsula was \"lost years ago\".  \nBut Zelensky has pointed to a 2018 \"Crimea declaration\" by Trump's then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying the US \"rejects Russia's attempted annexation\".\nUkraine and its European allies have in recent weeks expressed alarm over what many on the continent see as Trump's warming of relations with Vladimir Putin's Russia. \nIn later remarks made after his BBC interview about the possibility of Ukraine ceding territory, Klitschko said he \"did not say anything new\" and that many world politicians and media outlets were discussing it as a potential outcome of a peace deal.\n\"We understand that the scenario involving territorial concessions contradicts our national interests and we must fight against its implementation until the very end. This will require extraordinary efforts both from us and European partners,\" he added.\nAs talks ramp up, Russian strikes on Ukraine have continued. \nOn Thursday, an attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured dozens, officials said. The BBC witnessed the body of a child being brought out from the wreckage of their home while people quietly cried nearby.\nSvitlana, a teacher at a school close by which was also hit, spoke of her hurt and added she believed Russia would not stop its aggression if Ukraine gave up Crimea.\n\"Those who think that Putin will stop if he is given Crimea, they don't know who the Russians are, he is not going to stop,\" she said. \nShe said Zelensky expresses the opinion of \"all of us and we support him\".\nAnother woman, Olha, who had helped rescue workers carry out 10 people, five of whom were dead and the rest injured, was more critical.\n\"As of now I think it's better to be away from here because nothing good awaits us here,\" she said, adding there \"will not be a good solution\" for Ukraine. \nShe said Zelensky \"was a comedian and he should have stayed a comedian\".",

        "article_text": "Organisers of the BBC Proms are encouraging fans to stay up all night, with a \"magical\" and \"intimate\" after-hours concert at the Royal Albert Hall.\nPlans for the Dark Till Dawn Prom were unveiled in the programme announcing the summer festival, which will also feature one-handed pianist Nicholas McCarthy, rock star St Vincent and a celebration of film composer Bernard Herrmann.\nThe ever-popular CBeebies Prom will return, and Claudia Winkelman will host a concert exploring the tense and haunting soundtrack to the hit TV show The Traitors.\nHighlights of the classical repertoire include Shoshtakovich's opera Lady Macbeth, and Korean sensation Yunchan Lim playing Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No 4.\nOn 5 September, Sir Simon Rattle will conduct Chineke! - Europe's first minority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra - for the first time.\nTheir concert will include a performance of the final work by Pulitzer-winning US composer George Walker, which was written as a response to the 2015 Charleston church shooting.\nOther stars gracing the 2025 season include soprano of the moment Aigul Akhmetshina, making her Proms debut, violinist Randall Goosby, sitar virtuoso Anoushka Shankar, Pakistani-American singer Arroj Aftab, and Grammy award-winner Angelique Kidjo.\nThere will be 86 concerts in all, with a number taking place in Gateshead, Bristol, Bradford, Belfast and Sunderland. \nTickets go on sale at 9am on 17 May. On-the-day \"Promming\" tickets are \u00a38 including booking fees, and seated tickets start from \u00a310 plus booking fees.\nThe all-nighter, on 8 August, is being planned by organist Anna Lapwood, who said the idea had been several years in the making.\n\"I spend a lot of time at the Albert Hall in the middle of the night, practicing, and I find it fascinating that the building is still just running overnight,\" she says. \n\"There are always people there - cleaners and security guards - a bit like A Night At The Museum. \n\"So we talked about how fun it would be to be able to invite people into that space, both physically, but also the abstract space of being in an iconic building in the middle of the night.\"\nHer programme will include YouTube pianist Hayato Sumino, Russian cellist Anastasia Kobekina and Norwegian ensemble Barroksolistene, whose \"Alehouse sessions\" aim to recreate the atmosphere of a 17th Century English tavern.\nLapwood says the artists are all connected by an enthusiasm for \"messing around\" with music, citing Sumino's viral video of the \"seven degrees of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\". \n\"There are various moments where we're hoping to do some collaborations,\" she reveals. \"But the logistics of this are all very, very complicated, not least trying to figure out everyone's sleep schedules!\"\nThis summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard. He has been replaced by Hannah Donat who, as director of artistic planning, had shaped the festival alongside the controller of BBC Radio 3, Sam Jackson. \n\"I think of the Proms as the classical music equivalent of Wimbledon,\" she says. \n\"Everyone likes to go to Wimbledon, even if they don't watch tennis for the rest of the year; and everyone likes to go to a Prom, even if they're not going to concerts for the rest of the season.\"\n\"It gives the concerts a warmth and an informal atmosphere. \n\"People don't worry too much about knowing the repertoire inside out - there's just something spectacular about the Albert Hall and seeing the orchestra onstage.\"\n\nAmong the concerts to watch out for are:\n19 July: The Great American Songbook and Beyond with Samara Joy.

It's going to be exciting, the first six rounds will be explosive.''\nRetired world champion Tony Bellew: ''I think Conor Benn will get to Eubank. If he does get through those first five or six rounds, he's took what Conor's got and he starts unloading himself. It's a fight of two halves. Neither's defence is that good and both of them want to get at to each other, bad.''\nRetired world champion Barry Jones: \"I think Eubank wins on points. Benn might be able to tough it out as he is a tough kid, but I don't know if he has the ability. Eubank can't make middleweight no more, it drains him and he beat an old Liam Smith in their rematch. But he's a massive guy, so if he's able to rehydrate correctly, he is just too fast and too big.\"\nHeavyweight Fabio Wardley: \"My initial feeling is Eubank will get the win. The weight factor will play quite a big part, asking Benn to come up two weights is a lot against someone who is naturally comfortable fighting at that weight. Benn can carry some strong power at his weight, but there is a large difference when those punches which you hit in your previous weight would take them out but a bigger guy is more used to taking bigger shots and they don't have the same effect.\"\nScotland's first female world champion Hannah Rankin: \"I think it will be a later-round stoppage from Eubank. Experience and size is in his favour. I will be very surprised if Benn gets the win. Eubank is stronger. He's been in there with solid opponents that have tested his chin. I'm surprised how many people see this as a 50-50.\"\nUnbeaten light-welterweight Adam Azim: \"Benn to knock him out. He's the younger fighter, very powerful. Eubank's last performance wasn't the greatest.\"\nThis video can not be played\nFighting Benn is 10 times bigger now - Eubank\nMiddleweight Hamzah Sheeraz: \"I think Benn is going to win. I want Eubank to win for selfish reasons and wanting to fight him in the future, but I feel like Benn will do the job.\"\nHeavyweight Delicious Orie: \"I see Eubank doing the job. It will be a great fight but Eubank edges it. He has the experience and weight advantage. I think he's probably got into Benn's head a little bit as well in the press conferences. It's more than just about the physicality of it, it's about the mental side too.\" \nScotland's former undisputed light-welterweight world champion Josh Taylor: \"Eubank is the naturally bigger and more experienced opponent but Benn is a young, hungry lion. He has the advantage of not having to cut weight and to be able to get bigger and stronger. He also has youth on his side. But my head is going with Eubank.\" \nBenn's promoter, Eddie Hearn: \"Benn has to start fast in this fight, he has to land and he has to hurt him early and get his respect and, quite frankly, get him out of there. I think we need him out in six rounds. He lands early, clean and cold, and I believe Eubank is stopped.\"\nLight-heavyweight Lyndon Arthur: \"I think Benn's going to come out and he might shock Eubank. He could get caught coming in though.\"\nCruiserweight Cheavon Clarke: \"I'm on the fence. Maybe a draw.\"\nFormer light-middleweight world champion Liam Smith: \"I find it hard to pick a winner, I won't be surprised with either result. I do edge towards Benn winning on points.\"\nEubank's promoter, Ben Shalom: \"I think Eubank wins by knockout. It will be a frantic first two or three rounds and then it will calm down and Eubank will take over. A knockout in round six.\"\nBritish heavyweight Derek Chisora: \"The smart money is on Eubank. He had fights when Benn was on holiday. But I'm friends with Benn, he comes to my house so my money is on him. I'm 50/50 but I'll go with Benn because I want him to win because of his family and legacy.\"\nFormer cruiserweight world champion Johnny Nelson: \"I'm saying Eubank because he had more consistency in his career. Benn's style is so ferocious and attacking that should suit Eubank in the first six rounds.\"\nLight-heavyweight Anthony Yarde: \"If Benn wins it is because he goes in with controlled aggression and detonates when he needs to. If Benn hurts Eubank then he is good at finishing. If Eubank wins then it's being himself but an aggressive version of himself. He needs to be switched on. The version we saw in his second fight against Liam Smith. Eubank is a world-class operator and he has shown that.\"\nEubank Sr's former promoter Barry Hearn: \"I think this is a 50-50 fight - of course I'm on Conor's side, but I'm not going to ignore that the other man is a much bigger man with more experience. It is going to be something awesome. I think Nigel will have Conor ready for war but in a more controlled way.\"\nSuper-bantamweight Francesca Hennessy: \"They're both great fighters.

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds.

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes.

        "article_text": "When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief.\nTen of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%.\nOnly Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days.\nThe exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US.\nCommentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers.\nWhile plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to.\nHere I'll set out this debate \u2013 starting with the potential upsides for the region.\nSouth America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.\nThe US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.\nFor example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US.\nThere is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports.\nWith the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat.\nThese include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group.\nHe tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was \"excellent for Brazilian agriculture\" as \"Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us\".\nHowever, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising \"bilateral barriers\" on commodities mostly just affects \"who sells to whom\", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally.\nSo his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers.\n\"The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors\u2026 for example if there is a recession,\" he tells the BBC.\nYet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US.\nTake the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports.\nJapan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America.\nOther Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market.\nBrazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.\nTrump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US.\nThis would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers.\nMeanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place. \nThe other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%.\nUruguay's new President Yamand\u00fa Orsi has also said that Trump's tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America's bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality.\nHe said that \"Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat\" in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners.\nYou may have noted a lot of \"coulds\" and \"ifs\". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability.\nWhether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent.\nFirstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium.\nThe US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%.\nBrazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  \u2013 bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry.\nArgentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers.\n\"We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,\" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald.\nTrump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export.\nEduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a \"serious headwind\" for South America.\nLooking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump.\nAfter all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries.\nMr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. \"If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil.\"\nHe theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America.\nSo, calling Trump's tariffs a clear \"win\" or \"loss\" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%.\nAs Mr Hallak says: \"It's very hard to predict where this is going.\"\nSubject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods.\nBut adds: \"I'm not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don't think so.\"\n",

        "article_text": "Stars from the reality television show Love On The Spectrum went on the defensive  after Robert F Kennedy Jr commented that people with autism make limited contributions to society. \nPeople with autism \"will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go on a date\", the US Health and Human Services chief said earlier this month.\nThe remarks drew widespread anger from people with autism who reject the notion of needing to be repaired, but also responses from those pushing for a greater understanding of autism.\n\"Autistic people have the same hopes, dreams and yes, the same awkward dating moments as anyone else,\" Dani Bowman, one of the television show's star's said to US media. \nThe reality TV star on the show, which is about a group of autistic adults' experiences dating, said Kennedy's comments were \"completely false\". \nSince joining the Trump administration, Kennedy, who in the past has promoted debunked theories suggesting autism is linked to vaccines, has made autism a main focus. Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThat rise is, at least in part, attributable to increased autism awareness and an expanding definition of the disorder, scientists say. First recognized as a developmental disorder in 1978, autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that symptoms vary by person. Some need little to no support in their daily lives, while others need a great amount. \nEarlier this month, Kennedy pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months. He did not give details on the project or funding it. He also said his department would investigate potential causes.\n\"Everything is on the table - our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting, all the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic,\" Kennedy later told Fox News. \nExperts have warned that finding the causes of autism spectrum disorder will not be straightforward, and called the effort misguided and unrealistic.\nThe idea of curing autism is concerning for some.\n\"Wanting to cure autism implies that our way of being is wrong and it isn't,\" Ms Bowman told NewsNation. \"We don't need to be fixed. We need to be supported. But the answer isn't erasing autism, it's building a more inclusive world for all of us.\"\nAnother star of Love on the Spectrum, James B Jones, attacked Kennedy's autism remarks on social media, calling them \"extremely ignorant, and to be perfectly frank, downright offensive\".\nBut not everyone agrees. \nWhile advocacy groups focus on acceptance and inclusion they avoid \"uncomfortable truths about children like mine\", Emily May, who has a child with autism, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece on Friday.\n\"I have no interest in defending Mr. Kennedy, whose shaky science and conspiracy theories will do nothing to benefit those with autism and their families,\" Ms May said.  \"And yet, I think his remarks echo the reality and pain of a subset of parents of children with autism who feel left out of much of the conversation around the condition.\"\nOne of Kennedy's main false claims was that \"autism comes from vaccines\". Although he has denied many times that  he is anti-vaccination and said he and his children are vaccinated, he has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccine harm.\nThe theory came from a study by Andrew Wakefield in 1998, but it was later retracted by the Lancet medical journal. Multiple studies since have concluded there is no link between vaccines and autism.\nDespite her frustration, Ms May expressed admiration for Kennedy's \"willingness to speak frankly about the painful parts of [her] child's life\".\nAutism Speaks, an advocacy organisation, agreed in part with Ms May. \nThe organisation said it heard from parents who felt Kennedy's comments resonated \"with their lived experience\". \n\"The language we use matters,\" Autism Speaks said in a statement to the BBC. \"It should reflect current science and honor the lived experiences of autistic people, many of whom lead fulfilling lives and make invaluable contributions to their families, workplaces and communities.\"\nDr Manish Arora, founder of LinusBio who has spent more than two decades studying autism, noted that Kennedy's statements can be \"very hurtful for families and autistic individuals\". \nBut he also welcomed more research into the causes of autism and said increased attention is a \"meaningful opportunity\". \nStill, he wishes the debate was \"less polarising\". \n\"Scientists should see the opportunity here, avoid the polarised discourse and see the opportunities here,\" Dr Arora told the BBC. \nJake Tilk, and his brother, Max Tilk, who is on the autism spectrum, largely avoid that political discourse in their social media videos where they share what their day-to-day life looks. \nThey share their lives online to create awareness and acceptance of autism, because the brothers want to celebrate neurodiversity, Jake Tilk told the BBC. \n\"It's most important that discussions about autism are grounded in science, compassion and most importantly the living experiences of people with autism themselves,\" he said.

        "article_text": "In the 20 years since its creation, YouTube has grown from humble beginnings to billions of videos being watched every day - but can posting videos on the platform offer a viable career? We spoke to some of South Yorkshire's favourite creators about how the website changed their lives.\nRuth Amos from Sheffield runs Kids Invent Stuff. The channel has 71,000 followers and has been going since 2015. \nPrimary school children send in their invention ideas and Ruth and her colleague Shawn bring them to life.\n\"There's lots of different ways that you can make money from YouTube, there's ads, sponsors, collaborators or you can have things like Patreon, where people support the work that you're doing. \n\"Quite often, it you're a content creator you do a lot of those different ways, not just one of those things,\" she says.\n\"When I was growing up you couldn't watch someone's channel about robot making or cookery and that's what's amazing about YouTube \u2013 all of our hobbies have found a home on there as well as some of those viral moments.\"\nThe channel has run collaborations with Channel 4 TV show Taskmaster and had a go at breaking Guinness World Records. \nAccording to Ofcom, more than 80% of three to 17-year-olds use the site. A survey by the Lego Group in 2019 suggested a third of young Britons and Americans wanted to be vloggers. \nHowever, there are more than 100 million channels on the site - some with only a handful of followers or video watches.\nWould Ruth recommend the career to the children who send her their invention ideas? \n\"I think it is a career anyone can do because if you're interested in creating content, and you're creative, it's actually something lots of people can have a go at,\" she says. \n\"If someone wants to be a YouTuber I would also think about your other skills, because some of the most popular channels are channels where people are filming themselves doing something else. So think about your skill.\"\nLee Hinchcliffe, from Barnsley, has been filming content for the platform since he was 15. \nHe began with gaming videos before trying skit videos and then challenge videos.\nHis channel took off when he started playing McDonald's Monopoly. He spent hundreds of pounds at the chain trying to win a \u00a310,000 prize ticket. \n\"I never won it, I lost a lot of money, but people saw that video,\" he says.\n\"I've always had the love of creating videos and entertaining all my life, so that's why I've gone at it since school.\n\"YouTube is my university and I got my degree there, because you can watch back everything I've done.\" \nOff the back of his channel, Lee became a TV presenter with CBBC, starring on screen alongside madcap puppet Hacker T Dog. \nHe said his YouTube experience had made the switch to television much easier. \n\"Instead of doing a screen test and auditions, it was like, 'we've seen your videos, here's your mic, here's your earpiece, off you pop',\" he says.\n\"It's an obsession and it's grown into a career I'm able to do every day. There's no switch off because it's hard to switch off from something you love so much, and it needs constant plate spinning.\"\nSteve Garbutt, 55, runs Yorkshire Car Restoration in Doncaster with his son Shane.\nThe pair have been creating YouTube videos for the past five years and their business has boomed.\nSteve says they had gone from a 1,000ft warehouse to 10,000ft - and from three or four cars to more than 40.\n\"You have to put many hours into YouTube, because you not only have to do the work, you've got to change camera and lighting, and you're doubling your work load. Then you've got to go home and edit all your footage,\" he says.\n\"I've always been a bit of a techy, I like my gadgets and things. My original training when I left school was in computers. And then at 21 I changed careers because I thought there was too many people doing it.\"\nThey began on the platform by offering free car restoration to famous YouTubers such as Mat Armstrong, who has 4.5m followers.\n\"You've got to be very clever, you've got to look where the opportunities are. Rather than money it gives you a lot of opportunities. \n\"Our first opportunities were to restore famous YouTubers' cars free of charge, in exchange we got them advertising for us and sending us people to watch.\"\nThey have also worked with The Stig from Top Gear, Mike Brewer from Wheeler Dealers and Jonny Smith from The Late Brake Show.\nOriginally they hoped the channel would make money but they soon found the support they received more rewarding.\n\"We get so many good comments it makes you want to make another video. Even if the financial reward isn't there, because unless you're someone like Mat Armstrong it's not as profitable as everybody thinks,\" Steve says.\n\"The amount of hours you put in doesn't warrant that kind of money, you should be paid more. But the reward is massive.\n\"I would encourage someone not to just do YouTube, to make sure they get a career and base their YouTube on something they love.\n\"Don't think your niche is going to explode and make you famous.\"\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North",

On Wednesday, officials lifted an evacuation order affecting around 5,000 residents. \nNo injuries or deaths have been reported.

        "article_text": "When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief.\nTen of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%.\nOnly Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days.\nThe exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US.\nCommentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers.\nWhile plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to.\nHere I'll set out this debate \u2013 starting with the potential upsides for the region.\nSouth America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.\nThe US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.\nFor example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US.\nThere is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports.\nWith the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat.\nThese include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group.\nHe tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was \"excellent for Brazilian agriculture\" as \"Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us\".\nHowever, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising \"bilateral barriers\" on commodities mostly just affects \"who sells to whom\", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally.\nSo his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers.\n\"The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors\u2026 for example if there is a recession,\" he tells the BBC.\nYet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US.\nTake the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports.\nJapan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America.\nOther Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market.\nBrazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.\nTrump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US.\nThis would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers.\nMeanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place. \nThe other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%.\nUruguay's new President Yamand\u00fa Orsi has also said that Trump's tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America's bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality.\nHe said that \"Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat\" in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners.\nYou may have noted a lot of \"coulds\" and \"ifs\". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability.\nWhether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent.\nFirstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium.\nThe US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%.\nBrazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  \u2013 bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry.\nArgentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers.\n\"We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,\" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald.\nTrump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export.\nEduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a \"serious headwind\" for South America.\nLooking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump.\nAfter all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries.\nMr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. \"If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil.\"\nHe theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America.\nSo, calling Trump's tariffs a clear \"win\" or \"loss\" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%.\nAs Mr Hallak says: \"It's very hard to predict where this is going.\"\nSubject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods.\nBut adds: \"I'm not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don't think so.\"\n",

Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.The US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.For example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies.

It is understood that a referee's basic pay is generally rather modest, certainly compared to the top players.\nWe can confidently say that Ben Woollaston's World Championship earnings this year will top any referee's income from the 17 days.\nReaching the second round means he is assured of at least \u00a330,000. The champion collects \u00a3500,000.\nBen's plan for Friday was to sleep as much as possible so that he feels fresh to go again when he plays China's Si Jiahui in round two, in a match that begins on Saturday.\nHe was seen with Tatiana and Edward heading back to their hotel at about 01:00 BST, and while Ben and Edward possibly had a lie-in, there was no such comfort for Tatiana.\nShe was straight back to work, refereeing the second session of the round two match between Mark Allen and Chris Wakelin.\nThat began at 10:00 BST, and it contained what might go down as another career highlight - picking the black ball out of the pocket as Allen became the 11th man to make a 147 maximum break at the World Championship.\nSo far, Sheffield is treating the Woollastons well.\nHearn ready for snooker to leave Crucible after 2027\n'National hero' - China's pursuit of an elusive world title",

        "article_text": "South Africa's finance minister has dropped plans to increase value-added tax (VAT), in a major climbdown to prevent the collapse of the coalition government. \nEnoch Godongwana's decision came after the second-biggest party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), threatened to quit the government, warning a VAT hike would hurt the poor the most. \nGodongwana, a member of President Cyril Ramaphosa's African National Congress (ANC), had argued the increase was needed as the government was facing a financial crisis. \nBut with other parties also rejecting the hike, it raised the prospect of parliament taking the unprecedented step of voting down the national budget, forcing him and the ANC to concede.\nThe climbdown is likely to be a relief for many South Africans, who are already struggling financially because of the high cost of living and an unemployment rate of 32%. \nThe ANC lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since since white-minority rule ended in 1994 in last year's elections, forcing it to share power. \nThe DA welcomed the climbdown, saying it had entered the government \"with steel spines and a clear mission: grow the economy and create jobs to rescue South Africa\". \n\"We opposed the unjust VAT hike from day one - and South Africa won,\" it said in a statement.\nThe DA had also challenged the hike in the High Court, with three judges - who heard the case - expected to give their ruling before the end of the month. \nGodongwana had proposed increasing Vat by half a percentage point, to 15.5% with effect from 1 May, saying it would help provide much-needed revenue to improve public services like education and health. \nThe ANC denied it had bowed to pressure by scrapping the increase. \nThe decision had been taken out a of \"a shared commitment across party lines that the working class, the poor, and all other people cannot be further burdened in this economic climate\", said party spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri. \nIn a statement, the finance ministry said there would now be a need to revisit \"other expenditure decisions\" and to scrap \"measures to cushion lower income households\"  from the planned VAT hike. \nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF),  the second-biggest opposition party in parliament, said South Africa had witnessed a \"budget fiasco\", and the \"incompetent\" Godongwana should resign. \nThe ANC was banking on smaller parties - especially Action SA, which was seen as the kingmaker - to gain a parliamentary majority for the budget, but it refused to budge on its demand for the increase to be dropped.\nThe hike was also opposed by the biggest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu), which is in alliance with the ANC.\nEven the head of the government's tax agency questioned the proposed increase, saying the last hike in 2018 did not significantly boost government revenue.\nThe crisis is likely to further damage the ANC's credibility, with opinion polls suggesting that its popularity is falling.\nAn opinion poll released earlier this month by the Institute of Race Relations put the party's support at 29.7%, while a poll in February by the Social Research Foundation put it at 32%. Both had a margin of error of around 4%. \nThe foundation said a \"significant chunk\" of ANC voters were \"so dissatisfied with the party and uncertain about their future voting intention\" that they had become \"free agents in South Africa's voting market\".\nIn last year's election, the ANC's share of the vote slumped to 40%, from 58% in the 2019 poll. \nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "The west Belfast rap group Kneecap have hit back at a call for their US visas to be revoked after their performance at Coachella where they ended their set with pro-Palestinian messages.\nWriting on social media, TV personality and music manager Sharon Osbourne said the hip-hop trio \"took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements\".\nWhen asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: \"Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.\"\nThe festival's organisers have also been approached for comment.\nKneecap have been vocal supporters of the Palestinian people, often raising the conflict in their live performances.\nHamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages.\nIsrael launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to figures released by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe number of children who have been killed in Gaza is disputed. International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.\nSpeaking to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 , Kneecap's manager said: \"If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.\"\nDaniel Lambert added: \"Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.\"\nHe also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as \"too severe to get into\".\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that \"may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted\".\nThe band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.\nOn Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included \"projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech\".\n\"This band openly support terrorist organizations,\" she added.\nMs Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).\n\"Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,\" Osbourne said.\n\"However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,\" she continued.\n\"This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\" Osbourne said.\n\"I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,\" she said.\nOsbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.\nShe also managed her husband's solo career.\nOsbourne finished her post by saying: \"As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.\n\"I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.\" \nThe festival organisers have been approached for comment.\nWarning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive\nAt the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.\nThe first message said: \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" followed by: \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,\" and a final screen added: \"[Expletive] Israel. Free Palestine.\"\nDuring the performance, band member Mo Chara said: \"The Irish not so long ago were persecuted at the hands of the Brits, but we were never bombed from the... skies with nowhere to go.\n\"The Palestinians have nowhere to go.\"\nThe band also led the audience in chants of: \"Free, free Palestine\".\nOn 11 April, during Kneecap's first Coachella performance, the group faced criticism after leading an anti-Margaret Thatcher chant - which was subsequently omitted from the festival's livestream - along with calls for a united Ireland.\nA US State Department spokesperson said: \"Due to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally will not comment on department actions with respect to specific cases.\"\nThey said the Trump administration \"is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process\".\n\"When considering revocations, the department looks at information that arises after the visa was issued that may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted,\" they added.\n\"This can include everything from arrests, criminal convictions, and engaging in conduct that is inconsistent with the visa classification, to an overstay.\"",

        "article_text": "BBC film critics Caryn James and Nicholas Barber pick their cinema highlights of the year so far, from a brutal war epic to an ambitious period vampire drama.\nThe sharpest American indie film of the year so far, Companion stars Jack Quaid and Sophie Thatcher as a devoted young couple who go to stay with some friends in a Russian tycoon's remote forest getaway. (Rupert Friend has a hilarious cameo as the mulleted oligarch.) As a drunken evening of confessions, suspicions and disagreements unfolds, it seems at first if the film might be a romantic comedy, or maybe a noirish thriller about a robbery gone wrong. In fact, Companion is a science-fiction comedy thriller \u2013 but beyond that, the less you know about the film in advance, the more enjoyable its many ingenious twists and turns will be. Suffice it to say that the big-screen debut of writer-director Drew Hancock is a sparklingly entertaining satire on modern technology and the never-more-relevant topic of how entitled and misogynistic certain insecure young men can be. And it packs all of its ideas into 97 minutes. (NB)\nAs stunning as Ryan Coogler's Black Panther was, he has outdone himself with Sinners. Michael B Jordan is slyly convincing as twins named Smoke and Stack, who return from Chicago to their home town in Mississippi, in the Jim Crow South in 1932, to open a juke joint. With huge ambition and imagination, Coogler swirls familiar genres and tropes into a wholly original film that blurs the real and the supernatural. Sinners is a period piece as well as a vampire film. It is a drama about racism, family, superstition and spirituality, and it comes with passionate sex and exhilarating blues music. Coogler directs with brio, at times creating a phantasmagoria in which robed African musicians appear next to rappers. The first hour is so full of texture it could stand alone as a period film, but the supernatural eventually intrudes, leading to a finale of action, blood and vengeance. Jordan is surrounded by a superb supporting cast, including Delroy Lindo, Wunmi Musaku and Hailee Steinfeld.\u00a0 Sex, blues and vampires at the door? What more can anyone want from a film? (CJ)\nMiranda Yousef's riveting documentary tells the stranger-than-fiction story of Thomas Kinkade, one of the biggest-selling artists in history. Critics dismissed his work as nauseatingly sickly, but in the 1990s and 2000s, there were shops all around the US devoted to Kinkade's sentimental pictures of cosy country cottages. Art for Everybody asks fascinating questions about who gets to decide what counts as legitimate art, and whether some paintings can be more moral than others \u2013 questions that resonate today, in light of the continuing culture wars in the US . But Yousef's delicately balanced and sensitive film is just as fascinating on personal issues as it is on sociopolitical ones. A key part of Kinkade's marketing was his carefully constructed public image as a devoutly Christian, all-American family man, and yet the so-called \"Painter of Light\" had a dark side, too. Did the pressures of being a squeaky-clean Dr Jekyll push him into becoming a self-destructive Mr Hyde? (NB)\nAlex Garland, the writer and director of Civil War, and Ray Mendoza, a veteran who was that film's military advisor, have created a harrowing, visceral, real-time drama that recreates an actual battle between Navy Seals and al-Qaeda jihadists. Garland's virtuoso technique and Mendoza's first-hand experience of war blend in a film of uncompromising focus, which plunges us into the intensity of combat without explanation or backstory. Yet the faces of Joseph Quinn, Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis and D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai are enough to capture the fear and determination of being under siege. Creating characters far from the bravado of typical Hollywood war films, the actors depict courage in battle as a terror-filled endurance test. The film immerses us in that feeling. It is loud and intense, relentless in its barrage of grenades and gunfire, and when the cries of pain from the injured men start, they never stop. Warfare is a dazzling technical achievement but much more. Focusing on the personal cost of combat and violence itself rather than the politics of the Iraq conflict, it reinvents the war film with bracing freshness and immediacy. (CJ)\nBarry Keoghan, Christopher Abbott and Colm Meaney star in this dark and bloody western-style thriller about a feud between sheep farmers in remote rural Ireland. Meaney and Abbott (who speak their dialogue in Irish) play a laconic father and son who lose their two prize rams, only to discover that they have been stolen by their neighbour's shiftless son (Keoghan). Accusations are made, simmering resentments reach boiling point, and violence ensues \u2013 but then Christopher Andrews, the film's debut writer-director, rewinds his story and replays it from a revelatory new perspective. Suddenly, a hard-boiled story of crime and retribution becomes an aching tragedy about desperate economic hardship, youthful stupidity, male pride, and the traumas passed down from taciturn fathers to taciturn sons. Bring Them Down is tough to watch but it's beautifully shot, cleverly plotted and stunningly powerful. (NB)\nAlain Guiraudie's (Stranger by the Lake) engaging film is full of surprises. It starts as a drama about Jeremie, a young man returning to his small village in the lush French countryside for a funeral, then becomes a quietly comic take on desire along with a thriller about covering up a murder. The film deftly carries the audience with it through all these turns. Jeremie is an opportunist but also an enigma. He may have had a passion for his former boss and mentor, the village baker, who died. The baker's widow definitely seems interested in Jeremie, who grew up as the best friend of her son, Vincent; he now angrily suspects Jeremie of wanting to sleep with his mother. Jeremie does not want that but he does find himself in a reluctant affair with the local priest. The joke is that so many people lust after the unremarkable Jeremie, and the suspense comes from the small-town eyes and local police wondering what happened when Vincent mysteriously disappears. Misericordia (Latin for mercy) was nominated for eight Cesar awards, the French equivalent of the Oscars, including film and director, but its human comedy lands easily with audiences everywhere. (CJ)\nDeep in the leafy French countryside, a scruffy teenage layabout Totone (Cl\u00e9ment Faveau) has to look after his younger sister Claire (Luna Garret) after the sudden death of their father. His answer to their dire financial problems? Making award-winning luxury cheese. Louise Courvoisier's debut film is a heart-tugging coming-of-age drama, rooted in the soil of the Jura region where she grew up. She offers an earthy insider's view of how strenuous life can be for agricultural workers, and how wrenching it is when carefree youth turns to relentless, responsible adulthood. But she also fashions a warm, romantic, gorgeously scenic and ultimately hopeful tale of underdogs working together in the sunshine to improve their lives. Blessed are the cheesemakers, as Monty Python once put it. (NB)\nA giant, sloppy Great Dane tugs Naomi Watts around the streets of Manhattan, but by the end of this lovely film about affection and grief the physical comedy with the dog seems the least of it. Watts smoothly play Iris, a creative writing teacher whose best friend, Walter, a famous womanising author, kills himself. He leaves her his dog, Apollo, even though she lives in a one-room apartment in a pet-free building. Dealing with Apollo becomes a way for Iris to grapple with her feelings of love and loss for Walter, played by Bill Murray in flashback scenes filled with such wit and tenderness that they have a great impact in spite of his minimal screen time. Based on Sigrid Nunez's eloquent, acclaimed 2018 novel, the film was directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, whose films include the underrated Montana Story (2021) with Haley Lu Richardson and Owen Teague. Avoiding mawkish clich\u00e9s, they have created a gem of a film that is funny and touching whether you are a pet lover or not. Come for the rambunctious Great Dane, stay for the beautifully rendered emotions. (CJ)\nAardman's two greatest heroes are back \u2013 and so is their sneakiest ever adversary, a diabolical penguin named Feathers McGraw. Directed by Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, the Oscar-nominated Vengeance Most Fowl is chock-full of the qualities that make Wallace & Gromit's farcical adventures so cherished: the painstaking stop-motion claymation, the Heath Robinson-style gadgetry, the winking homages to classic cinema, the gleefully silly British humour, and the deep affection for the characters and their world. Above all, it a treat to see Feathers McGraw, more than 30 years after he was introduced in The Wrong Trousers. But there is more to the Bristol-based studio's new film than the nostalgic whimsy you would expect. When Wallace invents a robotic garden gnome that does all of Gromit's favourite gardening jobs (and that's even before it turns evil), the story takes a canalboat trip into Mission: Impossible territory by addressing fears about artificial intelligence. (NB)\nThe immensely talented director Rungano Nyoni, whose I Am Not a Witch (2017) won a Bafta for outstanding British debut, makes artful, accessible films of great visual panache. Her latest is a clear-eyed drama about cultural and generational conflict. The heroine, Shula, is a cosmopolitan woman recently returned from the city to her village in Zambia. Nyoni conveys this dissonance at once, as Shula drives home from a costume party dressed in a glittery silver helmet and dark glasses (an homage to a Missy Elliott video) and finds her Uncle Fred dead on a dirt road. As the story takes us into the family's traditional funeral rituals, it slowly reveals that Shula and two cousins had been abused by Fred as children, a reality their mothers put aside as they mourn their brother. Nyoni's style is realistic even as she drops in surreal images. The narrative about secrecy and the trauma of sexual assault builds in power right to the end, when Shula recalls a children's television programme and the title of this stunning film finally makes sense.

 \nIt is less than two years since Carlisle had the greatest day in their recent history when they won promotion to League One by beating Stockport County in the League Two play-off final at Wembley.\nIt was unlikely, and unexpected, and further cemented manager Paul Simpson's status as a local hero, back for his second spell in charge and adding a third promotion to the honours list.\nSadly, the jump proved too big for Carlisle, who were competing in the third tier with a budget befitting the bottom half of League Two.\nUnable to compete on or off the pitch, the Blues were relegated with a club-record low of 30 points after winning only seven games in the worst season in the club's history.\nHowever, during that campaign, the Piataks had come in guaranteeing investment and with big future plans, as they got used to the workings of English football.\nSimpson had survived relegation and was given the close season to rebuild, overseeing 12 new arrivals as the owners anticipated an immediate return to League One.\nInside wisdom suggested the man who guided England Under-20s to success in the World Cup in 2017 would be given 10 games to show he could mount a promotion challenge.\nHe managed four. \nThree losses out of those games - including heavy defeats on the road at Gillingham and pertinently at MK Dons - saw him leave his job on 31 August, the day after the transfer window had closed.\nUnder caretaker boss Mark Birch, two more games were lost, but owner Tom Piatak said promotion was still achievable, shortly before announcing Mike Williamson as the new head coach with the club languishing in 22nd.\nThe hierarchy were keen on the team developing a possession-based style and had been impressed by Williamson's MK Dons side in that 3-0 defeat in August.    \nCarlisle won once at Brunton Park between 17 August and 22 March\nThe former Newcastle United defender won his first game in charge at Swindon Town, but it proved to be a false dawn.\nHe failed to win over the Brunton Park crowd, who were not impressed by his switch to three at the back and the team's slow, cat-and-mouse style.\nIn fact, the fans made up their mind during the Boxing Day home loss to bottom club Morecambe and chanted for Williamson's removal.\nInstead, the change was a drastic one to the playing squad, as Williamson, together with newly appointed sporting director Rob Clarkson, brought in 11 players during the January transfer window, confident they would improve the style and the results.\nThe idea was that these players would fit a newly created \"Carlisle way\" that would run through the club and not be dependent on the individual picking the team.\nDuring that busy period in early January, Tom Piatak doubled down on his backing for Williamson.\nBut just over three weeks later, on 3 February, deadline day itself, Williamson was sacked following a shambolic 5-1 home defeat by Swindon, with nine of the 15 players involved January signings.\nHe won just four of 22 league games, while crucially the team failed to score in half of those. \nLooking for a second new boss of the season, Carlisle stunned most when they brought in Wales and Manchester United legend Mark Hughes.\nHe had been out of work for 16 months since leaving Bradford City, but it was a surprise to see him arriving in Cumbria to try to save the bottom club in the EFL from relegation.\nPerformances improved under the 61-year-old, but not at the rate required to pull Carlisle out of trouble.\nHughes criticised the squad's fitness after losing at Harrogate Town in early March, stating he had to make substitutions based on players' ability to last 90 minutes rather than for tactical reasons.\nEven at such a late stage of the campaign, Hughes had to organise bounce games in training in midweek to get people up to match fitness and to assess the huge squad at his disposal.\nVictory over Bromley on 22 March, only a second on their own turf since August, was delivered with only two of the 11 January arrivals starting the game. \nNow Carlisle go into the game at Cheltenham in their best form for two years with 10 points out of a possible 12, as Hughes has found a successful formula, but the feeling is that they have given themselves too much to do. If Tranmere win either of their last two games, whatever the Blues do will be irrelevant.   \nCentre-back and captain Sam Lavelle is joint top scorer with just four goals\nIf the worst happens, Carlisle would have to prepare for their first season in the National League since 2005.\nThat was a brief stay as they climbed back into the EFL at the first time of asking, but this relegation would be a colossal failure.\nA bloated squad will have to be trimmed, regardless of what division the team is in,  and a decision will have to be made on who is in charge.\nWould Hughes want to stay on? Or would the club opt for a manager with National League experience?\nIn recent seasons, Stockport County and Wrexham have shown what can happen in terms of momentum generated from coming up from the National League.\nBut both were marooned in non-league for over a decade before sorting themselves out - that is not a fate Carlisle fans want to contemplate after two seasons of utter misery.     \nPaul Newton, BBC Radio Cumbria sports editor\nOn Saturday 26 April 1975, Carlisle United were saying goodbye to their one and only season in the top flight of English football with a 0-0 draw at champions Derby County.\nFast forward exactly 50 years to Saturday, 26 April 2025 and the Cumbrians are facing the possibility of another relegation \u2013 however, this one would see them saying goodbye to their EFL status. \nThe last and, so far, only time that fate was to befall Carlisle, their opponents were Cheltenham Town in 2004. Carlisle's opponents this Saturday? You guessed it, Cheltenham.\nCarlisle fans don't need history to frame what has been another disastrous campaign. The prospect of back-to-back relegations under the club's American owners, the Piataks, is all too real, and serious questions will be asked about just what has gone so badly wrong.\nFans will point to some highly questionable decision-making \u2013 from the timing of Paul Simpson and Mike Williamson's sackings to four successive disastrous transfer windows despite substantial investment in the playing squad. \nEven if Carlisle do somehow pull off an escape arguably more miraculous than the famous Jimmy Glass one in these remaining two games, Carlisle, on the field, are in a mess.\nWhen the Piataks took over the club in October 2023, their promise was for Carlisle to \"Own The North\". Right now, that reality couldn't feel any further away.\nThis video can not be played\nS2 E44: Optimism Or Realism?",

He has also acknowledged making false statements and omissions on financial statements submitted to the House Ethics Committee and the FEC.\nThe former lawmaker has been ordered to pay at least $374,000 (\u00a3280,000) in restitution. \nHe has been attempting to raise money on Cameo, a platform where people can purchase personalized videos from celebrities.\nSantos's downfall began after the New York Times in 2022 published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.\nFrom there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 11 September terrorist attacks. Shortly after, local and federal officials began to investigate. \nHe was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023, he became the first member of Congress to be expelled in more than 20 years, only the sixth in history. \nA report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.\nSantos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.\nSantos, an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, has said that he would not ask the president for a pardon. \n\"If the president thinks I'm worthy of any level of clemency that is bestowed upon him, he can go ahead and do it, but for me to seek a pardon is to deny accountability and responsibility,\" Santos told the New York Times. \nYet he appeared to contradict himself in an episode of his podcast, when his guest, blogger Perez Hilton asked him if he would request a pardon if he were sentenced to years in prison. \n\"You bet your sweet ass I would,\" he told the TV personality.

        "article_text": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing. \nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened. \nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.  \nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.  \nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change. \nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.   \nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance. \nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI. \nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.   \nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.   \nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order. \nIt has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier. \n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute. \nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be an impossible choice for much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.\nThe fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously. \n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

        "article_text": "Major retailers have welcomed the government's review of a rule that allows small parcels to enter the UK duty-free, saying it gives overseas firms such as Shein and Temu an unfair advantage over British businesses.\nThe current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than \u00a3135 without incurring import taxes.\nFormer Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, whose retail group includes the Ryman and Robert Dyas, told the BBC that the measure was ruining UK High Streets.\nSome retailers have argued that they are being undercut by overseas rivals, but a body representing small businesses said scrapping the exemption could raise costs for them and prices for customers.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday that the government planned to review the customs treatment of low-value products entering the UK following complaints from retailers.\nThe explosion of parcels being shipped under the measure has prompted increased scrutiny in recent years. While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen sales soar.\nIt has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government \"for a very, very long time\", arguing the rule had a devastating impact \"on our retail landscape and our high streets\".\nHe joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.\nUK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they have to keep to.\nAside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.\nThe so-called \"de minimis\" rule has received renewed interest after US President Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure amid his escalating trade war with China. \nGoods worth less than $800 moving into the US will soon be subject to charges, when they were previously exempt. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices.\nIn the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on its exports.\nEarlier this month, the boss of Currys told the Financial Times that the \"single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK... is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace\".\nOn Thursday, Alex Baldock told the BBC that he was pleased the government was \"reviewing the low-value shipment loophole, and that they're committed to levelling the playing field between British and overseas retailers\".\nBut the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in its de minimis consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might \"ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers\".\n\"With 16% of goods moved by small firms sitting below the \u00a3135 threshold, a decision to scrap it impacts on trading and inflation,\" said Tina McKenzie, chair of the FSB.\n\"It's right to be concerned about potential future dumping of goods, as escalating tariffs applied by bigger global blocs against each other may mean a surge in goods arriving in markets like our own,\" she added.\nMr Paphitis told the BBC it was \"absolute nonsense\" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.\nHelen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was \"more critical now\" due to a \"rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market\".\nThe British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. It called on ministers to act to \"deter import surges\" in order to \"protect independent retailers\".\nWhen Sainsbury's announced their latest financial results earlier this month, boss Simon Roberts called on the government to act as soon as possible.\n\"Everyone should pay their tax... So if there's a loophole here which means that's not happening, then that needs to be closed so it's a level playing field for everybody,\" he said.",

'Absolute nonsense'Mr Paphitis told the BBC it was \"absolute nonsense\" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was \"more critical now\" due to a \"rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market\".The British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. Shein and Temu tax-free parcels rule under review1 day agoShareSaveFaarea MasudBusiness reporter, BBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesMajor retailers have welcomed the government's review of a rule that allows small parcels to enter the UK duty-free, saying it gives overseas firms such as Shein and Temu an unfair advantage over British businesses.The current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than \u00a3135 without incurring import taxes.Former Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, whose retail group includes the Ryman and Robert Dyas, told the BBC that the measure was ruining UK High Streets.Some retailers have argued that they are being undercut by overseas rivals, but a body representing small businesses said scrapping the exemption could raise costs for them and prices for customers.Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday that the government planned to review the customs treatment of low-value products entering the UK following complaints from retailers.The explosion of parcels being shipped under the measure has prompted increased scrutiny in recent years. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices.In the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on its exports.Earlier this month, the boss of Currys told the Financial Times that the \"single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK... is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace\".On Thursday, Alex Baldock told the BBC that he was pleased the government was \"reviewing the low-value shipment loophole, and that they're committed to levelling the playing field between British and overseas retailers\".But the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in its de minimis consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might \"ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers\". Goods worth less than $800 moving into the US will soon be subject to charges, when they were previously exempt.",

Lewis Ludlam beat Ben Hammersley to a grubber kick for the third after a fine passing move, before Harris went in after Tomos Williams, Christian Wade and Ruan Ackermann linked up to set up the Scotland centre.\nExeter's defence continued to struggle as Seb Atkinson strode through a massive gap 22 metres out to go in under the posts for the fifth try after 26 minutes, and it was just as tepid three minutes later when Anscombe got the sixth.\nIt took 32 minutes for Exeter to get into Gloucester's red zone as Paul Brown-Bampoe went close before Exeter lost the ball, although a minute later Josh Hodge at least got his side on the scoreboard when he raced in from 22 metres.\nBut once again Exeter's defence melted as Williams' lovely looping pass started a move that the Welsh scrum-half got on the end of for the seventh try shortly before half-time.\nExeter made five changes five minutes into the second period, but a minute later went further behind when Wade raced on to pick up his own chipped kick and was stopped just short of the Exeter line, only for Ford-Robinson to dot down from an inch or two out a few phases later.\nWade edged closer to the all-time Premiership try record when his chipped kick was gathered by Carreras, before the Argentine full-back gave it back for his 90th try in the league, and Atkinson got his second soon after when Carreras shook off a tackle from Brown-Bampoe to race in from distance to make it 60-7.\nIt continued to get embarrassing for the former European champions as Singleton broke off a lineout maul for the 11th try, 18 minutes into the second half, and the replacement hooker dotted down in the corner five minutes later when Gloucester broke the 70-point mark for the first time in a Premiership match.\nWhen Exeter did think they had scored a try it was ruled out for a forward pass, as Hodge was denied shortly after Singleton's second score, with Exeter's Will Haydon-Wood sin-binned for a tackle off the ball moments later.\nFrom the resulting penalty Gloucester kicked out the corner and Singleton was mauled in for his third try to take it to 79-7 with 11 minutes left, before Will Rigg and Haydon-Wood scored two late consolation tries for a shell-shocked Exeter side.\nGloucester head coach George Skivington told BBC Radio Gloucester:\n\"It's obviously a good day for us.

That's a heavy beating and at this stage it's a real kick in the teeth.\n\"In no way at all did we have any foothold in that game - nothing really held up and we gave up momentum so easily.\n\"You've got to not hide away from it, you've got to take responsibility that comes from putting the shirt on, and that will be our first point of call, and then we'll try and sit through the whys and hows.\n\"Right now it's important that we wear it and recognise that that is not an acceptable level of performance from anybody involved.\"\nGloucester: Carreras; Wade, Harris, S Atkinson, Morris; Anscombe, Williams; Rapava Ruskin, Blake, Fasogbon, Clark, Thomas, Clement, Ludlow (capt), Ackermann\nReplacements: Singleton, Ford-Robinson, Gotovtsev, Jordan, Clarke, Englefield, C Atkinson, Cotgreave\nExeter: Hodge; Hammersley, Slade, Hawkins, Brown-Bampoe; Skinner, Armstrong; Sio, Yeandle, Street, Tuima, Jenkins (capt), E Roots, Vintcent, Fisilau\nReplacements: Norey, Blose, Iosefa-Scott, Capstick, Vermeulen, Townsend, Haydon-Wood, Rigg\nYellow card: Haydon-Wood 68\nReferee: Karl Dickson",

        "article_text": "Ronnie O'Sullivan (left), Mark Williams (centre) and John Higgins are still all going well at the 2025 World Snooker Championship\nRonnie O'Sullivan was in dominant form and John Higgins won a final-frame decider to set up an enticing quarter-final with Mark Williams as snooker's legendary 'Class of 92' stars thrilled again at the World Championship.\nWilliams, 50, and 49-year-olds O'Sullivan and Higgins have won 14 world titles between them - and they each stayed on course for further glory on a super Saturday at the Crucible.\nWelshman Williams beat Iran's Hossein Vafaei 13-10 to become the oldest quarter-finalist in 15 years - since Steve Davis reached the last eight in 2010 at the age of 52.\nWilliams said he wanted Higgins to join him in the next phase, and the Scot, after blowing match-winning chances in the 23rd and 24th frames, held his nerve in a late-night decider to triumph 13-12 against Xiao Guodong.\nO'Sullivan is also in a great place to join Williams and Higgins in the quarter-finals as he raced to a 6-2 lead against China's Pang Junxu in the first session of their last-16 match.\n'The Rocket' is aiming to become the first man in the modern era to win the event eight times and his match with qualifier Pang, who is ranked 27th in the world, resumes at 14:30 BST on Sunday.\nO'Sullivan had won the closing five frames in his 10-4 success over Ali Carter in round one and raced into a 4-0 lead against Pang, aided by breaks of 58, 91, 50 and 63.\nPang made a 119 break in frame five, but that was his only run above 50. He had a chance to end only two frames behind, but another miss in frame eight helped O'Sullivan inch a step closer to the winning target in the best-of-25-frame match.\nO'Sullivan, Higgins and Williams all joined the professional tour in 1992, and 33 years later they remain formidable competitors on the biggest stages. With nine days remaining of this championship, they remain in the trophy hunt yet again.\nHiggins and Williams will play their first quarter-final session at 10:00 BST on Tuesday, with the second session at 19:00 on the same day, with the third session scheduled for 10:00 BST on Wednesday.\nThat schedule means the veteran campaigners face a lot of snooker in a short space of time.\nOn the match-up, Higgins said: \"It was different maybe 20-odd years ago when we were really big rivals - now we walk into the practice room and we give each other a nod as if to say: 'How are we still here competing with everybody?'\n\"It's incredible, and obviously you throw Ronnie into the mix as well - three special players.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, was full of admiration for the pair and said on BBC Two: \"If you need a man for the final frame - like Mark Williams, who finished in style today - it's John Higgins.\n\"All these years later, still doing the same thing, it was a pretty flawless final frame.

What caught my attention wasn't so much the body language or the greetings - it was the table.\nOn one side sat the combined might of the Russian delegation: President Putin, flanked by his veteran foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, his envoy on foreign investment Kirill Dmitriev, plus an interpreter.\nOn the other side, clearly outnumbered: Witkoff and a translator.\nThis is not traditional diplomacy - but then again, Witkoff is not a traditional diplomat. \nHe is a billionaire New York real estate developer and long-time confidant of Trump - who himself is not a traditional president.\nLike Trump, Witkoff has made a career in doing deals.\nThis is how high-level US-Russian diplomacy is being conducted now in the Trump era.\nIt's how crucial decisions with potential implications for the global order are being debated.\nFollowing this round of talks, Ushakov held a conference call for reporters. He insisted that the negotiations with Witkoff had been \"constructive and very useful\".\n\"May I ask a question?\" I began. \"What are the main sticking points, the obstacles to peace in Ukraine?\"\n\"Thank you,\" Ushakov said. \"We'll end it there.\" Conference call over.\nFrom the various alleged peace proposals that have been leaked to the press, there seem to be plenty of \"sticking points\". There are differences over the territorial concessions Ukraine would be required to make, security guarantees, sanctions relief for Russia and the sequencing - that is, the order in which obligations undertaken be carried out.\nThe day Witkoff flew to Moscow, on the edge of the city, peace was shattered.\nA car bomb killed a senior Russian general.\nYaroslav Moskalik was deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the Russian General Staff. The Kremlin accused Kyiv of assassinating him.\nIf that's true, it's a sign of how Russia's war in Ukraine has come much closer to home.\nThere is no guarantee that talks between Putin and Witkoff will bring peace. And there will be concern in Kyiv and in Europe that they were not at the table.\nWhat is clear is that  Putin and Trump are determined to bring their countries closer - whatever happens with the Ukraine peace process.\nFor Moscow and Washington, now their watchword is co-operation.\nOn Friday, I attended a ceremony at a Moscow military park symbolising this. \nIt marked the moment, 80 years ago, when American and Soviet soldiers met on the Elbe River in the dying days of World War Two. That was a time when Russia and America were allies. \nA military band played as people lined up to lay flowers at a memorial to the Meeting on the Elbe.\nPutin's invasion of Ukraine put the US and Russia on opposite sides, but times are changing again. \nThe White House and the Kremlin are trying to repair relations. Could they secure a peace deal, one that's acceptable to Ukraine?\n\"We are just re-establishing contact,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told me at the ceremony. \n\"We are just trying to find a way out of this terrible crisis which was created by the previous American administration. They ruined many things.\"\nMoscow presents itself as peacekeeper. It blames Kyiv and the \"collective West\" for the fighting.\nAnd yet in February 2022, it was President Putin who ordered Russian troops to invade a sovereign neighbouring country, to force it back into Moscow's orbit.\nSo much has changed, not least the attitude of the White House. \nPresident Biden had promised to support Ukraine \"for as long as we can\".\nEarlier this month, Trump blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for starting the war.\n\"You don't start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" Trump said.",

On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.\nBurnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.\nStreaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.\nA once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.\nAs a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.\nHealth has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.\nBut experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.\nAustralians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.\nHealthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.\nSeeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.\nThough she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.\n\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"\nWhen Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".\nHealth funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.\nPatients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.\nMedicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.\nFast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.\nThere is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.\nBut the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.\nThat is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.\nAccording to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.\nBut experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees.\nBrisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them.\n\"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester\u2026 [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\"\nAnd every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: \"At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing\u2026 [but] even grocery shopping is nuts.\n\"[I] just can't keep up.\"\nThis is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing. \nSo his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment?\nThis year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics \u2013 only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one.\nThe results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\"\nAnd that's just primary care.\nPublic specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed \u2013 with wait times often far beyond safe levels \u2013 that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work.\nThere are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief.\nThe BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment.\nOthers are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions.\nKimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children \u2013 who, like her, all have chronic illnesses \u2013 can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought.\n\"They're decisions that you really don't want to have to make,\" the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC.\n\"But when push comes to shove and you haven't got the money\u2026 you've got no other option. It's heart-breaking.\"\nAnother woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker.\n\"I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,\" she says.\nThe people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say.\n\"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says.\nAll of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust.\nEvery single one of those issues is more acute in the regions.\nStreaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all.\nIt's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice.\n\"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community.\n\"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\"\nShe came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps.\nIt's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment.\n\"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice.\nWhen the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.\nIt means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.\n\"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.\nLike many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.\nThere's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.\nMany doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.\nHealth economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.\nThe taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.\n\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"\nThe original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.\nShe says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need. \nBoth the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.\n\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.\nOn the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.\n\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.\nHis government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.\nBut the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill. \nProposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.\nOne Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.\nLabor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".\nBut many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference. \nThere's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.\nExperts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.\nThat is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.\nAnd the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost.\n\"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says.\nIn Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late. Things are already dangerous here.\n\"Maybe that's the cynic in me,\" she says, shaking her head.\n\"The definition of universal is everyone gets the same, but we know that's not true already.\"",

        "article_text": "The French government has been urged to reconsider rehoming two stranded killer whales in Canada.\nWikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo are currently held at Marineland Antibes, a marine zoo in southern France, where they were born and have been kept their entire lives. It closed in January.\nAn application to send them to the most likely rehoming destination - Loro Parque marine zoo in Tenerife - was blocked by Spanish authorities.

The decision by a Spanish scientific panel to block it came as a pleasant surprise to many of them.\n\"I was shocked,\" Lori told BBC News. \"We thought it was a fait accompli.

They swam to Norway where he died in 2003 following an infection.\nThere is no chance Wikie and Keijo will be released into the wild as, unlike Keiko, they were born in captivity.\nThey have spent their whole lives being cared for and entertained by their trainers.

        "article_text": "Arsenal are the only English team to have won the Women's Champions League - doing so in 2007 when the competition was known as the Uefa Women's Cup\nUefa Women's Champions League: Lyon v Arsenal\nVenue: Groupama Stadium Date: Sunday, 27 April Kick-off: 17:00 BST\nCoverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app\nArsenal are down, but they're definitely not out of their Women's Champions League semi-final against eight-time winners Lyon.\nThe Gunners had more shots, more possession and more touches inside their opponent's box in the first leg, but ultimately it was Lyon who left Emirates Stadium with a 2-1 lead.\nNow, Renee Slegers' side must overturn a deficit in France on Sunday if they are to reach their first Champions League final since 2007, the season in which they won the title.\nThey face a stiff task though, with Lyon unbeaten in the Champions League this season, having conceded just three goals in nine games. They have only been knocked out twice in 15 years after winning the first leg in the knockout stage and on those occasions it was to the now redundant away goals rule.\nWhile Chelsea's hopes of a first European trophy have been left hanging by a thread after their 4-1 first-leg defeat in Barcelona, there is belief Arsenal can still turn things around to ensure there is at least one English team in the final.\n\"This isn't 4-1. It's a completely different narrative, Arsenal are still in it. It's a completely different conversation,\" former Gunners defender Jen Beattie said.\nBut how exactly can Arsenal turn it around against a team that have reached the final of the Champions League 11 times in 15 years?\nBompastor set for 'biggest challenge' of career\nWomen\u2019s Champions League: Can Chelsea and Arsenal fight back?\nThis video can not be played\nWhy Arsenal must 'go for it' against Lyon\nIt wasn't so long ago that Arsenal put five goals past Lyon on French soil.\nPlaying under Jonas Eidevall - before Slegers had joined as his assistant manager - the Gunners outclassed the reigning champions in the group stage in 2022.\nCaitlin Foord, Frida Maanum and Beth Mead, who all started for Slegers on Saturday, were on the scoresheet.\nBut Arsenal lacked that ruthlessness against Lyon last Saturday, with Mead, Maanum, Foord and Alessia Russo missing multiple chances.\n\"Arsenal showed enough in this first leg to take confidence,\" ex-England defender Anita Asante told the Football News Show.\n\"They really dominated the ball, they had control in the final third, created a number of chances and they just missed some of that cutting edge.\"\nKadidiatou Diani beat Arsenal's offside trap to get behind their defence and she made no mistake with a crisp finish for a 17th-minute opener.\nAnd just as the hosts had pulled level through Mariona Caldentey's spot-kick, Lyon split their backline open with Ada Hegerberg pulling Leah Williamson out of position to open up space for Melchie Dumornay, who darted into the box and lifted the ball over Manuela Zinsberger.\n\"Lyon under Joe Montemurro are not afraid to not have the ball. They get the goals they need, sit back and don't seek to dominate necessarily,\" Asante added.\n\"They're a team that will play in transition and their players, especially in that front three, are all really dynamic and can play into space, carry the ball or threat in the box.\n\"I don't think it suits Arsenal necessarily to play on the counter. They will probably assess the first 10-15 minutes of the game and adapt from there.\"\nDespite their first-leg defeat, Beattie does not expect Arsenal to play \"very differently\".\n\"I think they got the press wrong once and Diani scored. I can't think of many other times where Lyon played through from a goal kick,\" she said.\n\"I think the Arsenal press was very, very good and if they do that again, they can go and get a result.\"\nSlegers said Arsenal must be wary of \"a lot of threats\", but that her side have the ability to \"expose\" Lyon.\n\"We're super humble for the task because they probably have the next level in them - but so do we,\" she said. \nKadidiatou Diani v Katie McCabe\nWith a front three made up of Diani, Dumornay and Tabitha Chawinga, Lyon are never going to be easy to contain.\nArsenal's full-back Katie McCabe, usually seen powering up and down the left flank, was more reserved when pitted against the rapid Diani in the first leg.\nThe winger found space by drifting infield between McCabe and Steph Catley and it was this movement that gifted Lyon the first goal, with Ellie Carpenter threading the ball through Arsenal's defence to put Diani one-on-one with Zinsberger.\nPost-match Lyon boss Montemurro said that was a key tactic they had identified to restrict McCabe's impact.\n\"Of course, I respect Diani and the whole Lyon team because of what they've achieved, but also we know our qualities and our strengths, especially going forward,\" McCabe said.\n\"And for me, that is one of my strengths, making forward runs and driving into spaces and delivering a ball into the box.\"\nMcCabe's pass map against Real Madrid (left) and Lyon (right)\nWendie Renard v Alessia Russo\nOne of the key questions for Slegers' side before the second leg is whether Wendie Renard will be back in the starting XI to make her 500th appearance for Lyon.\nThe 6ft 2in defender - known for her aerial prowess - was on the bench on Saturday after recovering from a foot injury.\n\"Crosses in the box were really effective [and] I think that's where Arsenal's best chances came from, but if Renard is back it is a different game, different tactics,\" Beattie said.\n\"[Arsenal will] have to play more passes in and around the box and break them down.\"\nArsenal scored all three of their goals from crosses during their second-leg comeback against Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, but they failed to make any of their 25 crosses count in the first leg against Lyon.\nRusso, the Gunners' top scorer with 18 goals this season, will want to more involved and put herself in dangerous areas after having just four touches inside Lyon's box.\nLindsey Heaps v Mariona Caldentey\nMariona Caldentey knows what it takes to win the Champions League.\nThe Spaniard won three European titles in four years with Barcelona before moving to Arsenal in July, and she's carried that winning mentality into this season.\nHaving scored in Arsenal's comeback against Real Madrid, Caldentey kept cool under the pressure to convert from the penalty spot against Lyon - her eighth goal involvement in this season's Champions League.\nBut it's not just her ability in attack that has helped Arsenal this term. The midfielder won more duels (nine) and tackles (three) than any other player in the first leg as she helped Arsenal dominate possession.\nHowever, Caldentey is up against another serial winner in Lindsey Heaps - known as Lindsey Horan before switching to her married name - in the middle of the park..\nDespite being forced to settle for less possession by Arsenal, Heaps illustrated her importance to the French giants by kickstarting the attack for Lyon's second goal at the Emirates with a midfield-splitting pass to Hegerberg.\nLindsey Heaps and Mariona Caldentey's touch maps during Arsenal's first leg against Lyon",

        "article_text": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - set up to cut US government spending - claims to have saved, on average, more than $10bn a week since President Trump entered office.\n\"We're talking about almost $200bn and rising fast,\" Trump told the BBC when talking about Mr Musk's cost-cutting drive on 23 April.\nDoge's website says it is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants and leases put in place by previous administrations, as well as tackling fraud and reducing the government workforce.\nBBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.\nOur analysis found that behind some of the large numbers, there is a lack of evidence to back them up.\nIn October, Mr Musk pledged to cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the federal government budget. He subsequently halved this target and on 10 April talked about making savings of $150bn from \"cutting fraud and waste\" by the end of the next financial year in 2026. \nThe US federal budget for the last financial year was $6.75tn.\nDoge publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - which stood at $160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April.\nHowever, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings.\nWe downloaded the data from the Doge website on 23 April and added up the total claimed savings from contracts, grants and leases. \nOur analysis found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence. \nUS media has also highlighted some accounting errors, including Doge mistakenly claiming to have saved $8bn from cancelling an immigration contract which in fact had a total value of $8m.\nDoge says it is working to upload all receipts in a \"digestible and transparent manner\" and that, as of 20 April, it has posted receipts \"representing around 30% of all total savings\". It also lists some receipts as being \"unavailable for legal reasons\".\nBBC Verify examined the four largest savings listed on the Doge website which had receipts attached.\nThe department claims these add up to $8.3bn, but after examining the evidence provided and speaking to people familiar with federal contracts, this figure appears to be overstated.\nFor three of the savings, Doge links to documents on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This is a database which records contracts given out by the US government.\nThe documents show a contract's start and end date, the maximum amount the government has agreed to spend, and how much of that has been spent.\nDavid Drabkin, a federal contracts expert who helped develop the FPDS database, said the maximum figure listed should be treated with caution. \n\"FPDS does not reflect the actual paid price until some period of time after the contract has been completed and the contract actions have been recorded,\" he says.\n\"For example, when buying research and development into a vaccine no one really knows how much that's going to cost - so when a price is set, it's not a definite price but rather an upper limit.\"\nSo if Doge counts the maximum figure, that can represent projected spending over a number of years, rather than a direct saving from the country's yearly spending.\nDoge's largest listed individual saving is $2.9bn. \nIt comes from cancelling a contract - which started in 2023 under President Biden - for a facility in Texas to house up to 3,000 unaccompanied migrant children.\nDoge appears to have taken the \"total contract value\" until 2028 - the end date listed - and subtracted the amount spent so far to get the $2.9bn figure. \nBut the contract was reviewed annually, meaning renewing it until 2028 was not guaranteed.\nA source familiar with this contract - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told BBC Verify that Doge's figure is \"based on speculative, never-used figures\" and that the actual spending depended on how many children were placed at the facility and the services they required.\n\"In truth, the government never incurred those costs and could never reach that ceiling amount. The real, documentable savings from early termination were approximately $153 million\", they estimated.\nThey say this figure comes from tallying up the $18m per month fixed running costs (for things like staffing and security at the facility) from February - when Doge announced the cut - to November - when the contract was subject to annual review.\nThey also told us that the site - which closed on the same day as the Doge announcement  - never reached its maximum capacity of 3,000 children, and about 2,000 stayed at the Texas facility at its peak, before numbers fell significantly as border crossings decreased.\nWe contacted the Administration for Children and Families and the Department for Health and Human Services which awarded the contract but are yet to hear back.\nThe second largest saving listed by Doge comes from cancelling a contract between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an IT company called Centennial Technologies which it claims was worth $1.9bn.\nThe document which Doge links to has a total contract value of $1.9bn and all of the other cost fields, including the amount already spent, are for $0.\nHowever, Mr Drabkin told us this does not necessarily mean that nothing had been spent on the contract.\nHe said several government departments have poor recording keeping, meaning the amount spent during some contracts might not always be updated in a timely fashion.\nThe contract start date is listed as August 2024 and was estimated to run until 2031.\nHowever, Centennial Technologies' CEO told the New York Times that the agreement had actually been cancelled last autumn during the Biden administration. \nThe company did not respond to our requests for further comment.\nAnother IT contract, this time with the Department of Defense, is the third largest claimed saving.\nDoge says $1.76bn was saved by cancelling a contract with an IT services company called A1FEDIMPACT. \nOn the contract document, the total value is listed as $2.4bn. An online database of government contracts called Higher Gov says this amount was the ceiling value.\nAgain, there is $0 recorded for the amount that had been spent at the time the contract was terminated.\nIt is unclear where Doge's figure of $1.76bn comes from - we have asked the Pentagon and the supplier about it.\nThe fourth largest claimed saving of $1.75bn comes from cancelling a USAID grant to Gavi, a global health organisation, which campaigns to improve access to vaccines.\nDoge links to a page on USASpending.gov.

        "summary": "The real, documentable savings from early termination were approximately $153 million\", they estimated.They say this figure comes from tallying up the $18m per month fixed running costs (for things like staffing and security at the facility) from February - when Doge announced the cut - to November - when the contract was subject to annual review.They also told us that the site - which closed on the same day as the Doge announcement  - never reached its maximum capacity of 3,000 children, and about 2,000 stayed at the Texas facility at its peak, before numbers fell significantly as border crossings decreased.We contacted the Administration for Children and Families and the Department for Health and Human Services which awarded the contract but are yet to hear back.What about the other big savings?The second largest saving listed by Doge comes from cancelling a contract between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an IT company called Centennial Technologies which it claims was worth $1.9bn.The document which Doge links to has a total contract value of $1.9bn and all of the other cost fields, including the amount already spent, are for $0.However, Mr Drabkin told us this does not necessarily mean that nothing had been spent on the contract.He said several government departments have poor recording keeping, meaning the amount spent during some contracts might not always be updated in a timely fashion.Musk to reduce Doge role after Tesla profits plungeWill Elon Musk be able to cut $2 trillion from US government spending?The contract start date is listed as August 2024 and was estimated to run until 2031.However, Centennial Technologies' CEO told the New York Times that the agreement had actually been cancelled last autumn during the Biden administration. \"Gavi has not received a termination notice related to this grant,\" a spokesperson told us.We have not found any evidence for the $1.75bn saving claimed by Doge, and a source familiar with the contract said it was unclear where it comes from.We asked the USAID Office of Inspector General about the grant but it did not respond to us.While Doge may have cut a significant amount of government spending, the lack of evidence provided for its biggest claimed savings makes it impossible to independently confirm exactly how much.Doge does not have a press office but BBC Verify has contacted the White House to ask for more evidence of these claimed savings. It also lists some receipts as being \"unavailable for legal reasons\".What's the evidence behind the biggest saving?BBC Verify examined the four largest savings listed on the Doge website which had receipts attached.The department claims these add up to $8.3bn, but after examining the evidence provided and speaking to people familiar with federal contracts, this figure appears to be overstated.For three of the savings, Doge links to documents on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). An online database of government contracts called Higher Gov says this amount was the ceiling value.Again, there is $0 recorded for the amount that had been spent at the time the contract was terminated.It is unclear where Doge's figure of $1.76bn comes from - we have asked the Pentagon and the supplier about it.The fourth largest claimed saving of $1.75bn comes from cancelling a USAID grant to Gavi, a global health organisation, which campaigns to improve access to vaccines.Doge links to a page on USASpending.gov. \"We're talking about almost $200bn and rising fast,\" Trump told the BBC when talking about Mr Musk's cost-cutting drive on 23 April.Doge's website says it is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants and leases put in place by previous administrations, as well as tackling fraud and reducing the government workforce.BBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.Our analysis found that behind some of the large numbers, there is a lack of evidence to back them up.How does Doge report savings?In October, Mr Musk pledged to cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the federal government budget.",

He had spent five weeks in hospital earlier this year receiving treatment for double pneumonia.\nPope Francis was the first Latin American leader of the Catholic Church and held the role for 12 years.\nRed-robed cardinals and white-clad priests escorted the Pope's coffin from his residence to the basilica on Wednesday. \nBells tolled during the 40-minute procession, while the crowd broke into applause - a traditional Italian sign of respect.\nSwiss Guards, who are responsible for the Pope's safety, escorted his coffin to the church's altar.\nPublic viewing began at 11:00 local time on Wednesday. \nSoon after, the queue was already eight hours long, according to Italian media. By mid-afternoon, tens of thousands of people were lining the square.\nAt midnight, when the church was supposed to close for the night, there was still a very long queue of people wanting to pay their respects.\nPolice in the Vatican had told the BBC that St Peter's Basilica would stay open all night so that a large crowd gathered on the square could file past the coffin.\nViewing continued until 05:30 on Thursday, then closed for an hour and a half, before reopening at 07:00. \nThe Pope's body will lie in state in the church until Friday evening, when his coffin will be sealed during a liturgical rite at 20:00, the Vatican said.\nThe ceremony will be overseen by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is the Pope's \"camerlengo\" or chamberlain and runs the Vatican until a new Pope is chosen. \nLuis and Macarena, from Mexico, had come to Rome for their honeymoon and hoped to see the Pope, who gives a special blessing to newlyweds. Luis told the BBC seeing the Pope's final resting place would allow them to feel a connection.\n\"Pope Francis is a saint and he will bless us from heaven,\" Luis said.\nMary Ellen, an American who lives in Italy, said she had come to the Vatican on an overnight train to \"say goodbye\".\n\"I love Papa Francesco,\" she said. \"Because he's humble, kind, he loves immigrants. I know he's put up with a lot of difficult things in the Vatican. He's fought against power and the power of the Vatican to be a true Christian, true Catholic.\"\nShe said when she passes the coffin, she will be praying and will ask Pope Francis for help with her own work with immigrants.\nInside St Peter's, under the watchful marble eye of popes and saints, a steady stream of people made their way to the Pope's casket to pay their respects.\nSome kneeled while others prayed and crossed themselves, before slowly moving on.\nMany lingered to admire the staggering beauty of the basilica. The atmosphere was quiet and solemn despite the thousands of people present.\nTwo women who waited for five hours to see the Pope said they had arrived at the basilica's queue at 09:00.\nOne told the BBC it was important to her to say goodbye to the pontiff.\n\"All these years I followed all he did and it's as if I travelled all over the world with him, even if I was just at home. He liked going everywhere and prioritises the poor,\" she said.\nAsked what was it like to see him in his coffin, she replied: \"It's just like the man we used to see on TV.\"\nFredrik, who is from Ghana but travelled from Poland, said the Pope had \"done his best\" and \"it is left to us to continue the good works\".\nEva Asensio, a Mexican on holiday in Italy, said she felt an affinity for the Argentine pope. \n\"We saw him as a good Pope \u2013 someone who supported everyone, no matter your sexual orientation, no matter where you came from. He united us,\" she said with tears in her eyes.\nMargaux, who is French and lives in Rome, said it was \"powerful to live this.\" \nTo her, Pope Francis meant \"hope\", and his more progressive social views were \"very important\", she said.\n\"I hope the next Pope will follow his path,\" she said.\nDignitaries from all over the world, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Prince William, will attend the funeral on Saturday.\nPope Francis left clear instructions that he wanted a smaller ceremony in keeping with his simpler tastes as pontiff. He had arranged for a benefactor to pay for it all.\nUnlike the vast majority of his predecessors, he will not be buried in St Peter's, but in a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in central Rome, beneath a tombstone inscribed only with his name.\nBefore being moved to St Peter's, Pope Francis had been lying in an open coffin in the chapel of his home, flanked by Swiss Guards and cardinals in prayer.\nHis last public appearance was on Easter Sunday, during which he delivered brief remarks to the masses gathered in St Peter's Square from a wheelchair. \nHe then greeted worshippers and blessed babies as he was driven in a car through the crowds.\nHis Papal apartments have been sealed, marking the start of the period known as the Sede Vacante - or empty seat \u2013  which continues until a new head of the church is elected.\n\nAdditional reporting by Jorge Perez",

        "article_text": "From an office perched on the scalloped edge of the continent, Victoria Bradley jokes that she has the most beautiful doctor's practice in Australia.\nOutside her window, farmland rolls into rocky coastline, hemming a glasslike bay striped with turquoise and populated by showboating dolphins.\nHome to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.\nFor Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.\nRunning the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.\nBurnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.\nStreaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.\nA once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.\nAs a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.\nHealth has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.\nBut experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.\nAustralians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.\nHealthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.\nSeeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.\nThough she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.\n\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"\nWhen Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".\nHealth funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.\nPatients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.\nMedicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.\nFast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.\nThere is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.\nBut the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.\nThat is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.\nAccording to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.\nBut experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees.\nBrisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them.\n\"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester\u2026 [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\"\nAnd every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: \"At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing\u2026 [but] even grocery shopping is nuts.\n\"[I] just can't keep up.\"\nThis is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing. \nSo his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment?\nThis year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics \u2013 only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one.\nThe results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\"\nAnd that's just primary care.\nPublic specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed \u2013 with wait times often far beyond safe levels \u2013 that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work.\nThere are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief.\nThe BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment.\nOthers are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions.\nKimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children \u2013 who, like her, all have chronic illnesses \u2013 can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought.\n\"They're decisions that you really don't want to have to make,\" the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC.\n\"But when push comes to shove and you haven't got the money\u2026 you've got no other option. It's heart-breaking.\"\nAnother woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker.\n\"I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,\" she says.\nThe people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say.\n\"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says.\nAll of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust.\nEvery single one of those issues is more acute in the regions.\nStreaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all.\nIt's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice.\n\"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community.\n\"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\"\nShe came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps.\nIt's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment.\n\"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice.\nWhen the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.\nIt means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.\n\"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.\nLike many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.\nThere's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.\nMany doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.\nHealth economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.\nThe taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.\n\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"\nThe original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.\nShe says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need. \nBoth the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.\n\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.\nOn the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.\n\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.\nHis government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.\nBut the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill. \nProposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.\nOne Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.\nLabor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".\nBut many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference. \nThere's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.\nExperts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.\nThat is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.\nAnd the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost.\n\"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says.\nIn Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late. Things are already dangerous here.\n\"Maybe that's the cynic in me,\" she says, shaking her head.\n\"The definition of universal is everyone gets the same, but we know that's not true already.\"",

There's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.Getty ImagesIn remote towns like Streaky Bay, people wonder if the damage to universal healthcare is already irreparableExperts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.That is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.And the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost. \"Access to healthcare has emerged as a key issue ahead of the May 3 election The original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.She says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.Fast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.There is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.But the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank. \nElevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.\nBut however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse. \nNot only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"\nComing at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.\nThe tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.\nIt came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.\nBut Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.\nDonald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy. \n\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"\nTrump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.\nLower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.\nTrump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.\nHe objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.\n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.\nTrump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.\nNor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.\nTrump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.\nIt has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.\nThe idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.\nSarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled. \nIf shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.\n\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.\nJoe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.\n\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy. \nHe said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed. \n\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"\nPowell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him. \nBut the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate. \nBy law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.\nThe administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure. \nMark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.\n\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.\nAsked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: \"Damage done.\"",

Both had a margin of error of around 4%. \nThe foundation said a \"significant chunk\" of ANC voters were \"so dissatisfied with the party and uncertain about their future voting intention\" that they had become \"free agents in South Africa's voting market\".\nIn last year's election, the ANC's share of the vote slumped to 40%, from 58% in the 2019 poll. \nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Esoteric and pioneering, the paintings of a lesser-known Pre-Raphaelite, Evelyn De Morgan, explored the trauma and meaning of war \u2013 and prefigured current fantasy art.\nOn a rocky beach that glows red with lava, smoke-breathing dragons surround wretched-looking prisoners beseeching an angel to deliver them from suffering. The oil painting Death of the Dragon by Evelyn De Morgan looks at first like a scene from the New Testament's apocalyptic Book of Revelation. But, painted between 1914 and 1918, it's also something more personal and critical: an allegory for the misery and bondage of World War One, and the confrontation between good and evil.\nThe spectacular painting, measuring more than a metre high, is one of the highlights of a new exhibition, Evelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London, at London's Guildhall Art Gallery, home to the City of London Corporation's art collection. On display are rarely seen works from the De Morgan Foundation, as well as two newly-restored paintings and two recreations, completed just last year, of works lost in an art warehouse fire in 1991.\u00a0\nThe show coincides with the reopening of the De Morgan Museum in Barnsley, Yorkshire, following an extensive roof renovation, and responds to a rising interest in this lesser-known artist. She has tended to be eclipsed by her husband William \u2013 a ceramicist and writer, who had worked early in his career with the textile designer William Morris \u2013 and the famous men in their circle: her uncle and art teacher, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, for example, and the painters William Holman Hunt and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Much of what we know about De Morgan today comes from her sister Wilhelmina, who set up the De Morgan Foundation, but even she saw fit to publish the couple's posthumous biography under the title William De Morgan and his Wife.\nYet, Evelyn De Morgan more than deserves the art world's belated acclaim. A Slade graduate, who was working at the tail end of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, she took the arguably twee or overly sentimental genre into new territory, creating tableaux that were unusually visionary and energetic. The women she portrayed were less passive than those depicted by her contemporaries, and featured as symbols of agency rather than objects of the male gaze. Instead of a drowned body floating down the river, as in Sir John Everett Millais' Ophelia, or figures whose main currency was their looks, we meet a skilled sorceress creating magical potions and flying superheroines who can cast rain, thunder and lightning from their fingers.\nThese goddess-like figures show the influence of the classical art that De Morgan had studied. Immaculately executed works such as Boreas and Oreithyia (1896) reveal her interest in mythology and her mastery of the human form, reminiscent of Michelangelo.\nIn Death of the Dragon, in terms of composition, it's easy to see the influence of Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus (1483\u20131485), which De Morgan had visited in Florence. If De Morgan's haloed angel echoes this idea of rebirth \u2212 reflecting the artist's belief in a spiritual afterlife \u2212 then the winged beasts are its counterpart, Death, always biting at the heels of the people and threatening to overcome them. Elsewhere in her work, Death takes alternative forms: a dark angel bearing a scythe, sea monsters or \u2013 more obliquely \u2013 a sand timer. It's a symbolism that speaks to life's transience, and acquires additional poignancy in her later work, conveying the collective trauma of living through a World War that claimed close to a million British lives.\n\"During the First World War they [the De Morgans] were in London, so they would have been directly affected,\" Jean McMeakin, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the De Morgan Foundation, tells the BBC. \"Death was real for them in a way that perhaps we've largely forgotten these days,\" she points out. \"Members of William's family died from tuberculosis, and his own health was often quite poor. Death was, in a way, always present in the background.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why this iconic 1839 painting is not what it seems\n\u2022 The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel\n\u2022 Nine striking, rare photos of 19th-Century America\nDe Morgan was a pacifist and her art became a form of activism. In Our Lady of Peace (1907), a response to the Boer Wars, a knight pleads for protection and peace, while in The Poor Man who Saved the City (1901), wisdom and diplomacy are advocated as alternatives to military intervention. Later, in The Red Cross (1914-16), angels carry the crucified Christ over a withered landscape pierced by Belgian war graves \u2013 a suggestion, perhaps, that the Christian faith is at odds with the brutality of war, but offers us hope of redemption. \"You must never praise war,\" De Morgan declared in The Result of an Experiment (1909), a book of \"automatic writing\" co-authored with her husband. \"The Devil invented it, and you can have no conception of its horrors.\"\nThe idea of the forces of good and evil acting upon ordinary people was pervasive at this time. \"Spiritualism was quite popular,\" asserts McMeakin, citing the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle \u2013 the creator of Sherlock Holmes \u2013 as one of its most famous adherents. Other-worldly beliefs, she says, were \"probably the result of the turmoil, the massive changes happening in society leading up to the turn of the century, plus a period of many wars, which would have had an impact on their view of the world\". Doubtless, De Morgan was also influenced by her mother-in-law, Sophia, a well-known spiritualist and medium. With so many lives lost, it was no doubt tempting to believe that you could reconnect with the departed.\nFor De Morgan, materialism was in opposition to spirituality, and many of her works conflate the pursuit of wealth with death. Crowns, as worn by the winged serpents in Death of the Dragon, are a repeated motif denoting greed and miserliness. In Earthbound (1897), an avaricious king in a gold cloak patterned with coins is about to be overwhelmed by the angel of death, while in The Barred Gate (c.1910-1914), a similar figure is denied entry to Heaven.\nWith the future so uncertain, De Morgan places the importance of spiritual fulfilment and happiness at the centre of much of her work. In Blindness and Cupidity Chasing Joy from the City (1897), for example, \"Cupidity\" is personified as a crowned figure clutching treasures who is driving away \"Joy\" in the form of an angel. Here, as in Death of the Dragon, the central characters are chained, suggesting trapped souls.\nIn The Prisoner (1907-1908), the barred window and a woman's chained wrists make captivity a metaphor for gender inequality, hinting at the De Morgans' support for universal suffrage (Evelyn was a signatory of at least two important petitions, while her husband was vice-president of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage). The theme recurs in Luna (1885), where the rope-bound body of a moon goddess, a mythological figure of feminine power, functions as a metaphor for a woman's struggle to influence her own destiny.\u00a0\nChristened \"Mary\", Evelyn later adopted her then-gender-neutral middle name, as women's art was not taken seriously. \"She wanted to be considered on the same level as her male peers,\" says McMeakin. \"We can assume a huge degree of self-possession and determination in her desire to become a professional artist,\" she adds, making the point that even De Morgan's mother opposed her career choice.\nTechnically, De Morgan was also a pioneer. She experimented with burnishing and rubbing gold pigment into her works to add depth and interest, and explored new painting techniques invented by her husband, made by grinding colours with glycerine and spirit. Stylistically, she was also ahead of her time. The unconventional use of pinks and purples, and the bold rings of rainbow-coloured light, prefigure the psychedelic painting styles of the 1970s, while her terrifying monsters would not look out of place in contemporary fantasy art.\nWhile art history has tended to paint women as virgin mothers, objects of beauty or temptresses, De Morgan's specifically female perspective recasts them as figures of hope that augur an alternative, brighter future. In Lux in Tenebris (light in darkness) (1895), for example, the female figure holds an olive branch in her right hand, offering a pathway to peace. In Death of the Dragon, the angel is surrounded by a magnificent rainbow: a symbol (along with the sky) of joy that denotes spiritual fulfilment and freedom, as well as the promise of an afterlife.\nIt's a mistake to think of works such as Death of the Dragon as \"completely bleak\", argues McMeakin, noting that \"often with [her] apocalyptic scenes, there is a glimmer of hope, or a part of the painting that is calm\". In many ways, Death of the Dragon is optimistic, expressing a sense that the war \u2013 the metaphorical dragon \u2013 is nearing its end, and that good can overcome evil. In this existential battle, De Morgan saw a place for her work. When she was aged\u00a0 just 17, she chastised herself for not painting enough. \"Art is eternal, but life is short,\" she wrote in her diary. \"I will make up for it now, I have not a moment to lose.\"\nEvelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London is at the Guildhall Art Gallery, London until 4 January 2026.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, and\u00a0Instagram",

        "article_text": "The Netherlands, March 2025. Yungblud is leaving his hotel in Amsterdam when he's approached by a fan in floods of tears.\n\"You saved my life,\" she sobs.\n\"No, you saved your own life,\" he replies, quietly. \"Maybe the music was the soundtrack, but you saved your own life, OK?\"\nLeaning in for a hug, he adds, \"Don't be sad, be happy. I love ya.\"\nIt's a remarkably touching moment, full of compassion and devoid of rock star ego.\nTwo weeks later, after a video of the encounter goes viral, Yungblud is still moved by the memory.\n\"I didn't think people would see that, except me and her,\" he says, \"but it was such a moment for me.\"\nThe interaction crystallised something he'd felt for a while.\n\"I always said that Bowie and My Chemical Romance saved my life, but ultimately you have to find yourself,\" he says.\n\"Like this morning, I put my headphones on and I listened to [The Verve's] Lucky Man, and it made me go, 'Oh, I'm ready to face the day'.\n\"But Richard Ashcroft didn't tell me I was ready to face the day. I said that to myself. \n\"That's what I was trying to tell that girl in Amsterdam.\"\n\nSelf-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way.\nOn the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase, a Louis Theroux documentary and enough clout to run his own festival.\nBut if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal.\nAnd the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised after long queues and a lack of water caused fans to pass out and miss the concert.\nHarrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low.\n\"Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make,\" he says.\n\"It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional.\"\nThe problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work.\n\"It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost,\" he observes.\n\"I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again.\"\nNowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single, Hello Heaven, Hello.\nOver nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda.\n\"Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from?\" Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition.\nThe song's purposefully unsuited to radio \u2013 unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment.\nCombining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album.  \n\n\"We were actually discouraged from doing it,\" he says.\n\"My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'.\"\nWarming to the theme, he continues: \"The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited. \n\"It can't be like a 50% version of me.\"\nTo achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds. \nProfessional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut.\n\"When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it,\" he argues.\n\"When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth.\"\nOne of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about \"feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that\".\n\"I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous,\" says the singer, who last year revealed he'd developed an eating disorder due to body dysmorphia.\n\"But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing.\"\nHe ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news after Russia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina.\n\"I met him before all that,\" says Harrison, \"but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me.\n\"If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out.\"\nFans have noticed the change\u2026 drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his \"shirt-off era\".\n\"Maybe the shirt-off era is a comeback to all the comments I've had,\" he laughs.\n\"I'm claiming a freedom and a sexiness and a liberation.\"\nHe's clearly found a degree of serenity, without surrendering the restless energy that propelled him to fame.\nPart of that is down to control. In January, he created a new company that brings together his core business of recorded music with touring operations, his fashion brand and his music festival, Bludfest.\nThe event kicked off in Milton Keynes last summer but suffered teething troubles, when fans were stuck in long queues. \n\"I will fully take responsibility for that,\" says the star, who claims he was \"backstage screaming\" at police and promoters to get the lines moving.\n\"The problem was, there were six gates open when there should have been 12,\" he says, suggesting people underestimated his fans' dedication.\n\"When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day.\n\"With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.\"\n\nDedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud. \nHe built the community directly from his phone and, whether intended or not, that connection has sustained his career - insulating him from the tyrannies of radio playlists and streaming placement.\nMaintaining a personal relationship becomes harder as his fanbase grows but, ever astute, he hired a fan to oversee his social accounts.\n\"She's called Jules Budd. She used to come to my gigs in Austin and she'd sell confetti to pay for gas money to the next city.\n\"She built an account called Yungblud Army, and she's amazing at letting me understand what are people feeling.\n\"If people are outside and security aren't treating them right, I know about it because she's in contact with them. So I brought her in to make the community safer as it gets bigger.\"\nWith his new album, he wants to make that community even bigger. Harking back to the sounds of Queen and David Bowie, he says it'll \"reclaim the good chords\" (Asus4 and Em7, in case you're wondering).\n\"The shackles are off,\" he grins.\n\"We made an album to showcase our ambition and the way we want to play. \n\"Can you imagine seeing Yungblud in a stadium? 100% yes. Let's do it.\"",

I just couldn't correct it and every time you make a change you think 'this is terrible'.\n\"I've changed my alignment, changed certain things.

It was a nice feeling and I did enjoy being out there.\n\"I didn't feel too nervous because my expectation levels were maybe just to get a few frames and see where we go. I didn't feel pressure and normally when I come here with a half-decent game I feel pressure more as it is a chance to go deep [into the draw], but on this occasion I wasn't expecting to do much.\n\"I'm going to give myself two years. No more exhibitions, no more distractions off the table. It might take one month, six months, a year and give it a good go. I owe it to snooker and to myself. I just have to put everything into this tournament.\"\nCarter felt O'Sullivan would claim an eighth world title if he could maintain the form he showed on Wednesday.\n\"No question, no-one can live with that,\" said the world number 18. \"He could've had 10 years off and still come here. He is a freak natural, that's why you love to watch him - he played fabulously well.\n\"When the opponent is potting all the balls every mistake is highlighted and you just have to sit and watch and hope. He looks like he is in a good place and he is the man to beat.\"\nJohn Parrott, the 1991 world champion, speaking on BBC Two, added: \"There should be a sign in the foyer which should say 'Quiet please, genius at work'.\n\"We use the word 'genius' in sport with people like Lionel Messi and players like Tiger Woods in his pomp.

        "article_text": "As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy.\nThere's a cold wind blowing from the \u00d8resund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in Helsing\u00f8r, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts.\u00a0\nThis windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds.\nThis year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April); Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take in Rupert Goold's production starring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2006.\u00a0\n\"There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,\" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.\u00a0\nAs a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that \"there's something rotten in the state of Denmark\" \u2013 the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure \u2013 it's hard to miss its appeal.\nToday, nothing looks rotten in Helsing\u00f8r \u2013 the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg \u2013\u00a0but he certainly knew it well.\n\"We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,\" she says. \"We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company.\"\nThey may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon \u2013 and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time.\nIn a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer \u2013 as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.\u00a0\nVisiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer, special tours invite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father \u2013 but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides.\nMore clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen.\n\"The first quarto \u2013 written very early in 1603 \u2013 is set in Denmark,\" said Steffensen, \"but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself.\"\nKing James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from \"The Lord Chamberlain's Men\" to \"The King's Men\" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play.\nWe climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in Helsing\u00f8r.\nLars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director of HamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell.\nHamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town's Shakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatre Schaub\u00fcne and a sell-out staging starring Jude Law.\nAs well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n\u2022 Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony\n\u2022 Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists \u2013 but does it actually work?\nA trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry \u2013 starring a young Claes Bang as Rosenkrantz \u2013 and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.\u00a0\n\"When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,\" said Engel. \"Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for.\"\nEngel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.\u00a0\nEngel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed by The Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.\u00a0\n\"This year we've taken a more classical approach,\" said Engel, \"because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it.\"\nIn testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said that every minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations.\n\"It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,\" says Harvey. \"A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people.\"\nVisiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the \"set\" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he \"was dead\" in the immediate aftermath.\nThe England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.\nSpeaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he \"remembers everything about it\".\n\"I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,\" he recalled.\n\"I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?\n\"My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.\"\nFlintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his \"biggest fear\" was that he no longer had a face left.\n\"I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.\"\nHe recalled being in \"agony\" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.\nThe incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.\nHe was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.\nSpeaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.\n\"As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.\n\"And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,\" he added. \"But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.\"\nSurgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were \"very complex\" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.\nHe \"lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,\" he said.\nMr Haq said the injuries were in the \"top five\" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.\nReflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he \"didn't think I had it in me to get through\" the ordeal.\n\"This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,\" he added.\n\"I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...\n\"Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.\"\nOne of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is \"loving\" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.\nFlintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery. \n\"When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,\" she said. \"It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.\"\nThe 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.\nThe acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.\nHe also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.\nIn 2023, the BBC \"rested\" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.\nThe documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",

        "article_text": "The creation of three \"dire wolf\" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.\nWhen news broke that Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based biotechnology company, had resurrected three extinct dire wolves, the internet reacted with awe. It is a species that last roamed the earth some 13,000 years ago, but has found recent fame thanks to Game of Thrones, which features fictional dire wolves.\nThe story was stoked further when a photograph of Game of Thrones author George R R Martin holding one of the adorable white pups was released. \"I have to say the rebirth of the direwolf has stirred me as no scientific news has since Neil Armstrong [walked] on the moon,\" Martin wrote on his blog.\nMartin, who is an investor in Colossal, added that more extinct species were on the way, including the woolly mammoth, Tasmanian tiger and dodo.\u00a0\nColossal \u2013 which is currently valued at $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) and is backed by high-profile donors such as Chris Hemsworth, Paris Hilton and the CIA \u2013 boldly states on its website that it's \"going to fix\" the problem of extinction.\nAccording to Matt James, the company's chief animal officer, the aim is not to create a Jurassic Park-like zoo full of extinct animals, but to reintroduce lost species back into the habitats they once occupied. Once those animals are settled in, Colossal expects them to exert positive change on their habitats. \"We're trying to focus on species that can have cascading effects on an ecosystem to improve stability, lift biodiversity and maybe even help with climate change buffering,\" James tells the BBC.\u00a0\u00a0\nDe-extinction has been talked about for decades. But Colossal's three dire wolves \u2013 which are actually grey wolves that possess 20 edited genes that are meant to give them dire wolf-like features \u2013 represent the most serious effort to date to make that lofty vision a reality.\nIn the wake of the dire wolf announcement, however, many scientists have criticised Colossal's approach. They see efforts to bring back long-extinct species as costly wastes of resources and a distraction from the significant work that's needed to save still-living species.\nThe BBC spoke with several experts in fields ranging from conservation biology to paleontology about efforts to resurrect species from extinction and whether they are likely to achieve the goals that Colossal hopes.\nChief among the concerns raised was that claiming it is possible to bring back extinct species may actually lead to more existing species being lost. It could give politicians and industries the idea that damage to the environment can be fixed by resurrecting species.\nSuch a message could be particularly damaging at a time when the US is withdrawing from international agreements on climate change and revoking measures intended protect the environment and wildlife, says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and independent consultant based in Washington, DC.\n\"It's beyond irresponsible for these people [Colossal] to be claiming some sort of conservation victory in this environment,\" he says.\nThis worry was quickly reinforced when Doug Burgum, the US Secretary of the Interior \u2013 who the Colossal team met with in advance of their dire wolf announcement \u2013 praised the company's work on X as a new \"bedrock for modern species conservation\". Burgum also criticised the ineffectiveness of the \"endangered species list\" \u2013 presumably a reference to the Red List of Threatened Species, drawn up by the International Union of Conservation (IUCN) or the list of threatened & endangered species maintained by branches of the US Government \u2013 thanks to what he characterised as a focus on regulation. \"Since the dawn of our nation, it has been innovation \u2013 not regulation \u2013 that has spawned American greatness,\" he wrote.\nBiodiversity is under a seemingly endless onslaught of threats, virtually all of which are imposed by humans. The leading reasons, according to the IUCN, are habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation from fishing and hunting, illegal wildlife trade, pollution and climate change.\nColossal claims that its de-extinction work will directly benefit conservation. But the company needs to tie its work to \"ameliorating, alleviating or reversing something that's on that list\" of threats to biodiversity, says Kent Redford, former director of the Wildlife Conservation Society who now works as an independent conservation consultant in Portland, Maine.\nWhile Colossal's de-extinction work is \"super-cool science,\" he continues, he does not see it alleviating any of the threats highlighted by the IUCN.\nColossal sees things otherwise. The company states on its website that woolly mammoths reintroduced to the Arctic, for example, will increase those habitats' resilience to climate change through their foraging behavior, which they say will help to keep carbon locked in permafrost in the ground. By scraping away snow, the company says, mammoths will expose the soil below to cold air, causing it to stay frozen.\u00a0\nHowever, Nitin Sekar, a conservation scientist with the Asian elephant specialist group at the IUCN, says he has struggled to find evidence in the scientific literature to support this claim. One study comparing carbon storage in the Arctic tundra to taiga forest found the soil in areas covered in trees could store nearly twice as much carbon overall. Only slightly more was found in the permafrost of the tundra than in the taiga. Nor could he find anything else about how mammoths might have affected carbon in general.\nSome research on existing species of arctic herbivores suggests that they can reduce permafrost thawing. One scoping study by researchers at the University of Oxford does point to the role mammoths had on the climate during the Pleistocene and suggests bison and horses could replicate some of that role. But those species need to be maintained at high densities \u2013 where they are fenced, fed and managed by humans \u2013 to have any protective effect. The Arctic ecosystem is also different today than it was in the Pleistocene, so it is also hard to say whether mammoth hybrids would have that same effect on today's landscape as species like caribou and reindeer.\nThere could be other ways that mammoths affect carbon levels. As temperatures increase, the act of trampling and scraping away snow could actually accelerate permafrost melting by exposing it to the Sun \u2013 an effect that some research suggests is already happening in wet lowlands in the Arctic.\u00a0\n\"Overall, with the data we have now, it's just impossible to know how mammoths affected their environment millennia ago, or how the mammoth-elephant hybrids will behave in our warmer future,\" Sekar says. \"It seems like a strange thing to gamble on in the face of an existential crisis, given the alternatives.\"\u00a0\nJames calls for more research to resolve these questions and show \"direct links and causation in a way that can help to bring the rest of the scientific community along on this journey\".\nDire wolves and woolly mammoths were driven extinct by the complex forces of a changing planet, not just by human activities. For species that humans are responsible for annihilating, though, simply bringing them back does not help to address the threats that pushed them to extinction in the first place, says Corinne Kendall, programme director for Southern Africa at the Peregrine Fund, a non-profit organisation that aims to conserve birds of prey around the world.\nModern conservationists recognise this and are increasingly focused on landscape-level solutions rather than saving a particular favourite species, Kendall adds.\n\"That's what's missing in the way Colossal is approaching this,\" she says. \"If you only address the genetics and technology side of things, it's interesting from a scientific discovery standpoint, but you're creating the trees without the forest.\"\nJulie Meachen, a vertebrate paleontologist and morphologist at Des Moines University in Iowa, believes, however, that the genetic techniques Colossal used to create its dire wolves are applicable to conservation. The company is also exploring ways to help still-living species such as the northern white rhino, elephants and endangered pigeons, she points out. \"These techniques could be applied to any species suffering from genetic diversity loss and to combat inbreeding or genetic bottlenecks in low population sizes,\" she says.\n\"I think the conservation work that Colossal is doing is far more important than the de-extinction work, but this conservation work does not get the same press coverage as the flashy de-extinction part,\" she adds. \"That is unfortunate.\"\nJames at Colossal agrees that de-extinction technologies are just \"one piece of a very complex puzzle\" that must also include things like habitat protection. But he says that attention-grabbing headlines about extinct species being brought back to life can act like \"a giant ship\" pulling \"all these other projects in its wake\".\u00a0\nIt is also important to be clear about what Colossal is actually able to achieve. It is unlikely to ever be possible to truly resurrect long-gone species like dire wolves or woolly mammoths, say scientists not involved with the company. Tissue samples from animals that have been extinct for tens of thousands of years lack the intact cells needed for traditional cloning techniques, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. \"What Colossal is engaging in is genetic modification of modern species to give them physical characteristics to make them look like extinct species.\"\u00a0\nThis in itself is a significant technical achievement, argues Colossal and its supporters.\nIn the case of the dire wolves, the three puppies it managed to breed are in reality \"genetically modified grey wolves\", say researchers. Essentially the genome of modern wolves was edited to replicate small segments of ancient DNA obtained from the fossilised remains of dire wolves. They are, the company admits, grey wolves with dire wolf characteristics.\nBut scientists have even questioned some of those characteristics.It's unlikely, for example, that dire wolves would have been white, but Colossal chose to make its animals white \"because of popular conceptions from Game of Thrones\", Gill says. \"This was an aesthetic choice, not a biological or scientific one.\"\nEven if Colossal did bring back animals that very closely resembled Ice Age species, they still would not be the same as the bona fide ones that lived thousands of years ago because the Pleistocene ecosystem they inhabited no longer exists, Meachen says. \"A dire wolf or any other species is not only its genes, but also its environment and all the other species living there.\"\nColossal says it has no plans of releasing dire wolves into the wild. But it does aspire to eventually repopulate parts of the Arctic with woolly mammoths. This would require engineering a lot of baby mammoth proxies, which the company plans to do by using Asian or African elephants as surrogates.\nIn the West especially, though, some people are starting to question the ethics of whether elephants \u2013 extremely intelligent, social and sentient beings \u2013 should be kept in captivity at all, much less be experimented on, Sekar says. Asian elephants in modern zoo facilities also frequently suffer from infertility and lose their calves to stillbirths and infanticides twice as often as elephants in semi-wild conditions, he says, while mothers deeply mourn dead calves. \"Are we really ok putting elephants through that so we can have these visually entertaining animals that aren't even real mammoths?\" asks Sekar.\nJames says that Colossal will have many quality control steps to ensure things go well for the elephants, and that the company will also be working with leading animal welfare experts to \"avoid potential welfare pitfalls ahead\".\u00a0\nColossal has not disclosed how much it invested in the dire wolf programme \u2013 but it's likely in the many millions of dollars. While costs of new technologies do eventually go down with scale, even if de-extinction does get cheaper, it will still be orders of magnitude more affordable and effective to stop species from going extinct in the first place, Shiffman says. Moreover, if the original drivers of extinction are not addressed, then de-extinct species could quickly become re-extinct, he warns.\nWhile Redford acknowledges that money is not fungible, if Colossal's primary goal really is conservation, then he says he has a hard time viewing its work on de-extinction as being \"the right investment to make\".\nFor every extinct species that Colossal is bringing back, however, James says the company is also investing in a surviving endangered species. Work is being done to introduce greater genetic diversity to populations of endangered red wolves in the US, for example, and to engineer elephants to be resistant to herpes virus.\u00a0\nBut while red wolves do have some issues with genetic diversity, their biggest threats are road collisions and human persecution, Kendall says. Without addressing \"how the animal is going to survive on the ground\", the genetic component becomes \"kind of irrelevant\".\u00a0\nHerpes also only kills a fraction of the number of wild Asian elephants each year compared to those killed by humans, says Sekar, , who has reviewed data from the Indian government about causes of elephant deaths. Around two wild elephants are known to die per year of herpes compared to around 100 killed in some way by humans, he says.\u00a0\nColossal could leverage its synthetic biology expertise in ways that are clear wins for the planet, experts say. Crops that are engineered to more efficiently take up nitrogen, for example, could be a huge boon for reducing the steep climate costs of nitrogen fertiliser and lessening the major dead zones that its runoffs cause in water bodies. Finding ways to engineer high quality animal proteins for human consumption could, likewise, be a game-changer for alleviating the many environmental and animal welfare concerns that plague the livestock industry, the experts say.\u00a0\n\"Colossal clearly has very talented biologists on their team,\" Sekar says. \"If they were to turn their attention to addressing problems like that, they could really be the heroes of conservation.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Indonesia is on an ambitious mission to offer free meals to 80 million school children - but that hasn't exactly gone according to plan.\nNearly 80 students across two high schools in Cianjur, south of the capital Jakarta, fell ill after eating the meals this week. Most of those who ended up in hospital have since been discharged.\nThis is the latest in a series of food poisonings that have been linked to the programme, a signature policy of President Prabowo Subianto.\nAuthorities investigating the case say the suspected cause is negligent food preparation. Samples from the vomit of students have been sent for lab testing, and police say they have questioned people handling the food, from cooks to packers to delivery workers.\nA 16-year-old student told local media that the shredded chicken in the meal had an \"unpleasant odour\". \"I felt dizzy, nauseous and vomited,\" he said.\nAcross the world, programmes offering free meals to students have proved to be effective in improving health, academic performance and attendance.\nBut Indonesia's $28bn (\u00a321bn) version - shaping up to be the most expensive of its kind - has become the target of food safety concerns and heated anti-government protests.\nIn February, when thousands took to the streets to protest at budget cuts, they aimed their ire at the hefty price of Prabowo's free school meals: \"Children eat for free, parents are laid off,\" read one of their protest signs.\nA centrepiece of Prabowo's presidential campaign last year, the free meals programme was pitched as a way to tackle stunting - a condition caused by malnutrition that affects a fifth of children below the age of five in Indonesia.\n\"Through this initiative, our children will grow taller and emerge as champions,\" Prabowo said in 2023.\nSince he took office last October, this programme, along with other populist policies like new houses and free medical check-ups, has earned him political points. His approval ratings stood at 80% after his first 100 days in power.\nIn the first phase, which began in January, free school meals have made their way to 550,000 students in 26 provinces.\nWhile the programme is \"well-intentioned\", Maria Monica Wihardja, a visiting fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told the BBC there has been \"no evidence\" of \"widespread urgency\" for free school meals.\nAccording to a national survey in 2024, less than 1% of Indonesia's households went at least one day without any meals in the past year.\nSince January, a series of food poisonings have raised apprehension about the free meals.\nMichelle, an elementary school student in East Nusa Tenggara province, was one of several in her school who suffered suspected food poisoning in February. She told BBC Indonesian at the time that the food, which had given her a stomach ache, was \"bland and stale\".\nAfter the incident, some parents started preparing homemade lunches for their children instead, a school official told BBC Indonesian.\nThis week, after the food poisoning in Cianjur, authorities have promised to step up food safety processes.\n\"We must improve quality,\" said Dadan Hindayana, head of the National Nutrition Agency, who had visited the students in hospital.\n\"\u2060One obvious thing is the lack of mature and in-depth planning before this program was launched,\" Eliza Mardian, a researcher at the Center of Reform on Economics Indonesia, told the BBC. \n\"The haste ends up sacrificing quality and effectiveness, which actually worsens the public's perception of this programme.\"\nThe cost of the programme has not helped matters. \nIndonesia has set aside more than $10bn this year for the free school meals.\nBy comparison, India spends $1.5bn a year to feed 120 million children in what is the world's largest such programme. Brazil's version costs about the same and serves some 40 million students.\nTo foot the steep bill in Indonesia, Prabowo has urged the country's tycoons to help, and accepted a funding offer from China. \nHe also ordered $19bn in cuts to pay for it, along with other populist schemes - which made it especially controversial.\nSeveral ministries, including education, had their budgets slashed by half. Bureaucrats who were not furloughed alleged they were forced to scrimp by limiting the use of air conditioning, lifts and even printers.\nUniversity students were furious as news spread of cancelled scholarship programmes and disruptions to their classes.\n\"The worst thing is when the stomach is full, but the brain is not filled,\" Muhammad Ramadan, a student protester in Bandung, told BBC Indonesian - referring to Prabowo's school meals plan.\nThere could be more challenges ahead, such as allegations of budget mismanagement, which have begun to emerge after Indonesia's anti-graft bureau flagged a \"real possibility\" of fraud in March.  \nPolice launched an investigation this month after a meal provider in south Jakarta accused authorities of embezzlement, saying that she has not been paid since her kitchen started preparing school meals in February.\nPrabowo, who has continued to defend the programme, said this week that his administration will \"handle\" the allegations and  \"safeguard every cent of public money\".\nExperts, however, say the problem runs much deeper. \nLarge-scale social assistance programmes in Indonesia have historically been \"riddled with corruption\", Muhammad Rafi Bakri, a research analyst at Indonesia's audit board, told the BBC.\n\"Given the sheer size of the budget,\" he said, \"this program is a goldmine for corrupt officials.\"\nWith reporting from BBC Indonesian",

        "article_text": "Katarina Zimmer put vinegar to the test as a cleaning product and discovered a wide range of benefits, for people and the planet.\nA few months ago in my new Berlin apartment, my toilet and I were at war. No amount of scrubbing or toilet cleaner would evict the limescale coating inside. Frustrated, I turned to Google and stumbled across a page recommending vinegar \u2013 something that the previous inhabitant had left behind in abundance. After dropping two tablespoons full of \"Essigessenz\" \u2013 essentially concentrated vinegar \u2013 into the toilet and waiting for half an hour, I scrubbed and the limescale came off in a moment.\u00a0\nSince then, I've enthusiastically used vinegar to rid my world of limescale. I've found it even more effective than my regular kitchen spray cleaner for getting my sink sparkling. That includes the faucet, which I wrapped in a vinegar-soaked kitchen tissue \u2013 whereas my regular cleaning spray dribbled off. And rather than having to buy special tablets to clean my limescale-smothered glass kettle, I simply poured two tablespoons of concentrated vinegar inside and boiled it. As the limescale crackled off, it made a satisfying sizzling sound.\nI wondered if vinegar had other advantages. Did it also kill off bacteria and other germs? And, importantly, was this simple, natural product better for the environment and for my health than regular cleaning products?\u00a0\nThe internet is full of sustainability influencers and green cleaning blogs that advertise vinegar as a jack-of-all-trades and a safer and \"greener\" alternative to \"toxic\" cleaning products. These claims make sense on the surface; vinegar is after all just fermented alcohol and has long been used as a food preservative, in salad dressings, as well as a household cleaner \u2013 but I wanted evidence. After interviewing three experts, I learned that while some of these claims are true, the benefits of vinegar depend a lot on how it's used and the kind of grime you're trying to get rid of.\nReassuringly, Eric Beckman, a chemical engineer and emeritus professor at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, told me that the best cleaning use for acetic acid \u2013 the main component of vinegar \u2013 is exactly what I had been using it for: as a descaler. Limescale \u2013 and rust, for that matter \u2013 consists of certain ions that dissolve more easily in acidic fluids like vinegar, he says. Beckman uses vinegar himself to get limescale off mirrors, while the microbiologist Dirk Bockm\u00fchl of Germany's Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences prefers using lemon juice, which contains citric acid, which he says is a more effective descaler and smells better. (Read more about why vinegar is such an effective cleaner.)\nThat said, vinegar doesn't work on everything. Beckman says that soap does a better job at removing oily films on dishes, while baking soda is effective against processed oils that have stuck onto surfaces while cooking. (Read more about whether baking soda is environmentally friendly).\nHowever, Beckman expresses exasperation about a popular remedy of mixing vinegar together with baking soda. The mixture is chemically quite useless, he says, as the acid of vinegar and the base of baking soda effectively cancel each other out. \"I use both, but not together,\" says Beckman. \"Together, they give you nothing.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nAnd while vinegar is often touted as a powerful antimicrobial, Bockm\u00fchl says, the truth is more nuanced. In a 2020 study, Bockm\u00fchl and his colleagues put vinegar to the test against a selection of disease-causing bacteria, viruses and fungi. While many internet recommendations suggest adding a dash of vinegar into a bucket of water for cleaning, Bockm\u00fchl found that its anti-microbial effects only kick in at an acetic acid concentration of 5% \u2013 its concentration in pure vinegar. And it was only fully effective at distilled concentrations of 10% \u00a0\u2013 to which the researchers added a dash of citric acid \u2013 in killing off five common bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as a mould, a yeast and a weakened strain of the vaccinia virus. Other studies have found that similar concentrations also work against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut even these concentrations didn't work against the MRSA bacterium, an especially stubborn strain of Staphylococcus aureus that's resistant to certain antibiotics, while countless bacteria remain untested. Many bacteria \u2013 including the ones that ferment alcohol into vinegar \u2013 thrive in acids, Beckman adds: \"Then they'll be like, 'ooh, yay, vinegar.'\" Some moulds, too, are resistant to acetic acid while some viruses \u2013 like norovirus \u2013 might be, too, Bockm\u00fchl suspects. Beckman says that soaps are more effective against bacteria, while standard disinfectants work better against viruses and moulds. Harsh treatments like bleach will definitely kill everything, Beckman says \u2013 although bleach can be unsafe if used incorrectly.\nBockm\u00fchl stresses that, even for the germs that vinegar does kill, a relatively high concentration is needed. The concentration won't be adequate \"if you just put a teaspoon of vinegar into your cleaning solution\", Bockm\u00fchl says.\u00a0\nHowever, the higher the dose of acetic acid, the more irritating it can be on the skin, he adds. It is harmful if it gets into your eyes. Surfaces can suffer, too: vinegar corrodes natural stone and metals like copper, bronze and brass, according to the Italian chemist Dario Bressanini's book The Science of Cleaning. And in dishwashers or washing machines, it can harm the rubber gaskets used to seal them, while it could also damage coffee machines and strip away the coating on tiles and grout, Bressanini writes. But Bockm\u00fchl assures me that it's fine to use vinegar on glass and ceramic surfaces \u2013 like my toilet \u2013 and stainless steel sinks.\nThe trouble that Bockm\u00fchl sees with using homemade cleaning products is that they don't come with instructions or safety recommendations. \"They might be safe if you know what you're doing,\" he says, \"but there are a lot of really stupid and absurd recommendations on the internet\".\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Are you cleaning your water bottle enough?\n\u2022 Why you might want to change your bedclothes more often\n\u2022 Seven proven ways to help the planet in 2025 \nTo learn more about how the health risks of vinegar compare with those of conventional cleaners, I called up Nicola Carslaw, professor of indoor air chemistry at the University of York in the UK. Her concern is how cleaners disrupt the air in our homes and buildings. It's known that professional domestic cleaners tend to have higher rates of asthma than other occupational groups, although it's proven difficult to pin that on any single product or ingredient.\nIn a recent study, Carslaw and her colleagues tested 23 different cleaning products including dishwasher fluid, washing up liquid and spray products, and found that many of them released volatile chemical compounds (VOCs). Some of these compounds, like terpenes, are often added to give pleasant aromas, such as lavender or pine oil, but they're highly reactive in the atmosphere. Terpenes for instance, easily react with ozone in the air, creating miniscule particles. In general, inhaling particles of this size has been linked to lung and heart disease.\n\"Your nose is a really good filter for the big particles, but the smaller ones can get all the way into your lungs [and] into the bloodstream,\" Carslaw says. Interestingly, in her study she found that cleaning products marketed as \"natural\" or \"green\" didn't seem any healthier in this regard. \"The natural/green ones had as many, if not more VOCs as the standard cleaners, and in many cases they were more reactive,\" she says.\nBut vinegar, by contrast, only consists of water and acetic acid (and a few other substances that make the difference between red and wine vinegar, for instance). As such, \"it's just not going to be chemically reactive in the same way\", Carslaw says. Another advantage of vinegar is that it's usually applied on a cloth to wipe surfaces rather than used as a spray, Carslaw adds. Research shows that cleaning products applied in spray form have more\u00a0harmful effects on the respiratory system\u00a0than liquids and wipes. (Read more about the health risks associated with cleaning products in Jessica Bradley's story).\u00a0\n\"When you spray something, you're turning the chemical into a form that's much easier to breathe [in] than if you have the liquid,\" Carslaw says. That said, she always advises gloves when there's risk of skin contact, good ventilation and avoiding excessive cleaning, whatever product is used. (Read more about whether we're cleaning too much for our own good).\nThis all left me with one remaining question: is using vinegar more environmentally friendly than conventional cleaners?\u00a0\nThat's a hard question to answer, says Beckman. Ideally, there would be life cycle analyses for cleaning products which track impacts from cradle to grave, tracing each ingredient back to its source, how it's produced, transported, packaged and eventually disposed of. But very few companies do that thoroughly, even if they do brand their products as \"green\", Beckman says.\u00a0\n\"But I will say this about vinegar. [Its] strength is its simplicity,\" Beckman says. Conventional cleaners can consist of more than a dozen different ingredients, many of them industrially manufactured in energy-consuming processes, he says. Acetic acid is born through the natural, yeast-driven fermentation of alcohol, which itself comes from the natural fermentation of sugar. The biggest environmental impact of vinegar-making is where the sugar came from \u2013 whether it's grapes, apples, grains, potatoes, or rice \u2013 which are largely renewable resources. Bockm\u00fchl cautions that this only applies to naturally fermented vinegars, the ones typically sold as food products; there are also synthetic vinegars which are derived from fossil fuels, meaning they come with all the environmentally harmful impacts of oil and gas extraction.\u00a0\u00a0\nEven at the very end of its life, vinegar has little impact. While many ingredients in soaps are tough molecules and don't easily biodegrade, sometimes continuing to kill organisms once they're in the environment, vinegar quickly breaks down, Beckman says. \"Vinegar passes muster on any sustainability scale because it's simple and it's degradable,\" he says.\u00a0\nAfter discovering all of this, I felt even better about using vinegar. I probably won't rely on it for ridding my surfaces of germs, but I'll keep using it to remove limescale and look forward to trying it out on the next rusty item I find. I'm happy to put up with the smell, knowing that I'm using a sustainable product that's likely better for my health.\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The scion of a prominent Maryland family who was top of his class at an elite private school before graduating from an Ivy League university, Luigi Mangione seemed to have everything going for him, according to friends.\nThey were left stunned by the 26-year-old's arrest for the murder of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive Brian Thompson, who was fatally shot outside of a hotel in New York City on 4 December. Mr Mangione denies that he murdered the father of two.\nAccording to a law enforcement, Mr Mangione was allegedly motivated by resentment at what he called \"parasitic\" health insurance companies.\nHe had spent time in a surfing community in Hawaii, but left owing to debilitating back pain, say those who remember him. It is unclear, however, to what extent his own health troubles shaped his views of the medical industry.\nMr Mangione is currently being held without bail at a notorious jail in Brooklyn, also holding rapper Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. He is facing federal charges, as well as state charges in New York and Pennsylvania. \nFederal prosecutors are pursuing the death penalty after charging him with multiple crimes, including murder and stalking.\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi said the death penalty was necessary because he committed a \"cold-blooded assassination that shocked America\".\n\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again,\" she continued.\nLawyers for Mr Mangione have called the move a \"political stunt\".\n\"Luigi is caught in a high stakes game of tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors, except the trophy is a young man's life,\" said his lawyers, Karen Agnifilo and Avi Moskowitz.\nIn New York, Mr Mangione has been charged with 11 crimes, including murder and terrorism.\nHe also was charged in Pennsylvania with forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime and providing a false identification to police.\nHe was arrested five days after the attack, at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and was allegedly in possession of a gun, bullets, multiple fake IDs and cash.\nMr Mangione also had a handwritten document that expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America and included passages such as \"frankly, these parasites had it coming\", according to police.\nInvestigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder. \nLaw enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.\nMr Mangione comes from a prominent family in the Baltimore area who are known for businesses including country clubs, nursing homes and a radio station according to local media. \nThe suspect's paternal grandparents, Nicholas and Mary Mangione, were real estate developers who purchased the Turf Valley Country Club in 1978 and Hayfields Country Club in Hunt Valley in 1986.\nShortly after Mr Mangione was charged, his cousin, Republican state lawmaker Nino Mangione, released a statement saying the family was \"shocked and devastated\".\n\"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved\", the statement read.\nThomas Maronick, a defence attorney who knows members of the family, told the BBC of his shock at the charges.\n\"You wouldn't think someone of privilege or means from a family that's known for doing so much for the community would do something like this,\" he said. \nMr Mangione attended the private, all-boys Gilman School in Baltimore. He was valedictorian, an accolade usually bestowed on the student with the highest academic achievements. \nSpeaking to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, one of his classmates said Mr Mangione \"didn't have any enemies\" and was a \"valedictorian for a reason\".\nMr Mangione went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. \nA friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a \"super normal\" and \"smart person\".\nMr Mangione was employed as a data engineer for TrueCar, a digital retailing website for new and used cars, according to his social media profiles. A company spokesman told the BBC he had not worked there since 2023. \nHe also spent time in a co-living surfing community in Hawaii called Surfbreak. Sarah Nehemiah, who knew him then, told CBS he left due to his back injury, which had worsened from surfing and hiking.\nFriends have told US media he had surgery on his back. The background image on an X account believed to belong to Mr Mangione shows an x-ray of a spine with hardware in it. \nOn a Reddit account that appears to have belonged to him, Mr Mangione reportedly posted about his struggles with chronic back pain and brain fog. \nA former roommate, RJ Martin, told the BBC that while Mr Mangione \"never complained\", his back pain at times \"prohibited him\" from doing \"many normal things\", such as surfing or playing volleyball. \nMr Martin - who eventually lost contact with Mr Mangione - said that he believed his former friend \"would have never conceived of hurting someone else\". \n\"There's no making sense of it,\" he added. \nA person matching his name and photo had an account on Goodreads, a user-generated book review site, where he read two books about back pain in 2022, one of them called Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry.\nHe also gave four stars to a text called Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski \u2013 also known as the Unabomber manifesto. \nStarting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others, until he was arrested in 1996.\nIn his review, Mr Mangione acknowledged Kaczynski was a violent individual, but also described him as a political revolutionary.\nMr Mangione's mother reported him missing in November to San Francisco authorities, telling them she had not heard from her son since July. \nAfter police began searching for the shooting suspect in Thompson's murder, the missing person report Mr Mangione's mother filed was flagged to authorities, New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters on Tuesday. \nPolice contacted Mr Mangione's mother, who did not identify her son as the suspect but said \"it might be something that she could see him doing\".

        "article_text": "Alex Yee is making his London Marathon debut 10 years after completing the Mini London Marathon for a fifth time\nWhen Alex Yee sits down for post-race dim sum with his family on Sunday, it will represent a poignant full-circle moment.\nThat was the reward Yee, who has Chinese heritage on his father's side, recalls provided the main motivation to run - and twice place third in - the Mini London Marathon as a child.\nIt was not long before the spectacle of the London Marathon captured his imagination and he nagged his parents to help him peer over the barriers for a closer look at the elites.\nBut on Sunday it is Yee, the reigning Olympic and world triathlon champion, whom hundreds of thousands of spectators will hope to catch a glimpse of as he embraces the unknown on the streets of his home city.\n\"As time went on I realised the excitement of the London Marathon, the impact it had and how momentous a day it was,\" Yee tells BBC Sport before his debut over 26.2 miles.\n\"I'm not thinking past the experience but afterwards I'd definitely like to get some dim sum with my family and have that deja vu moment,\" he adds, 10 years on from his last mini marathon.\nThere are certainly less demanding challenges the 27-year-old could have undertaken to provide the mental refresh he sought after a career-defining year. \nBut after capturing triathlon's two biggest prizes fewer than 12 weeks apart, ending his world title wait in October after his spectacular recovery on the banks of the River Seine clinched Olympic gold in Paris in the summer, Yee knew where he wanted to set his sights next.\nNot that he expected his coach to agree to his left-field suggestion.\n\"Definitely not. It's been something I've asked every single year, but it never really made sense,\" says Yee, the most decorated Olympic triathlete in history.\n\"This time we were trying to think what would get me to LA [2028 Olympics] in the best place mentally and physically. It was important to freshen things up.\n\"It's been really exciting to work on my running after five years of trying to make my swim and bike an appropriate level to be competitive in triathlon. It's something I've wanted to do and I'm excited to scratch that itch.\" \nLondon Marathon 2025 - everything you need to know\n'Our daughters will be with us', say dads of Southport victims running London Marathon\nAlex Yee overturned a 15-second deficit to rival Hayden Wilde in the final 2.5km to win a dramatic Olympic men's triathlon gold at Paris 2024\nIt should be no surprise that Yee, an athlete obsessed with the process of improvement as much as the success it brings, has relished this new challenge. \nHe speaks about his first marathon training block with a beaming smile and is not ruling out another in future - although a return to triathlon is scheduled for early 2026 at the latest.\n\"To have something which has given me that purpose to get out of bed, to go out and keep searching for those fine margins, I think that's really rare to find in the first year after an Olympics when you hear of athletes soul searching and not knowing what to do,\" says Yee.\n\"To be an expert on something, you have to be once a fool. That's the way I'm seeing it. I wanted to go in with an open mind and come out the other side as a better runner - but also better holistically.\n\"It's been really interesting to learn from so many people and feel like a novice again.\"\nYee is part of a stellar elite men's field featuring 10 athletes who have run the marathon in under two hours and five minutes, including one of his sporting idols in four-time winner Eliud Kipchoge.\nThere is also Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, defending champion Alexander Mutiso Munyao, and debutant Jacob Kiplimo - who in February became the first person to run a half marathon in under 57 minutes. \nYee's target?

All occurred in early April.\nThese early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.\nNot all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.\nCertain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.\nSome researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.\n\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".\n\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"\nThe recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.\nBut scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.\nA study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.\nShifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.\n\"One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,\" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh.\n\"We need to be prepared for this to become more common.\"\nAdditional reporting by Phil Leake\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to keep up with the latest climate and environment stories with the BBC's Justin Rowlatt.

But off the state's northern coast in Lake Huron is a serene, scenic island that has been luring travellers for hundreds of years \u2013 and has banned cars pretty much since they were invented.\nWelcome to Mackinac Island: a 3.8-sq-km island home to 600 year-round residents, no motorised vehicles and the only US highway where you're not allowed to drive a car. Even golf carts are prohibited on the island's streets, so chances are if you hear a honk or a screech, it's from one of the island's geese or owls.\nBut why the absence of autos?\nBecause as Urvana Tracey Morse, who owns a craft store on the island's main drag, says: \"Horse is king here.\"\nAccording to local lore, when a car backfired in 1898, scaring horses nearby, village authorities banned internal combustion engines, a move that was extended to the rest of the island two years later. Ever since, locals have leaned into this tranquil, once-upon-a-time way of life.\nMore than a century later, some 600 horses keep things running here, from the depths of winter to the mad summer rush when roughly 1.2 million people board a 20-minute ferry from Mackinaw City or St Ignace on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and descend on the small village (also called Mackinac Island) on the island's southern tip. There, visitors shop for the village's famous fudge, explore its 70 miles of trails and soak up the clip-clopping sounds of a simpler time.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"Horses are used in everything from garbage removal to FedEx deliveries,\" says Morse, who has been selling scrimshaw, art, jewellery and other merchandise after first visiting as a college student in 1990. \"That's how our lifestyle has been; that's how our pace is.\"\n\"Part of us just like the tradition that we get around by bike, or we walk or take the horse taxi,\" Morse adds.\nFor hundreds of years, Indigenous communities used the island's strategic location at the confluence of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan as a fishing and hunting ground. They thought its limestone bluffs and green forests resembled a giant turtle rising from the water, so they named it Michilimackinac, or \"place of the great turtle\" in Anishinaabemowin.\nBritish forces shortened the name and established a defensive fort on the island in 1780. Today, visitors can still follow costumed interpreters, experience cannon firings and see an officer's quarters inside the oldest building in Michigan. But more than 200 years after the US took control of Mackinac following the War of 1812, its Indigenous roots remain.\u00a0\nSaddle Up\nVisitors keen on getting in on the action can rent their own horse or horse-drawn buggy to explore the island, upon taking a short lesson.\n\"Mackinac Island is one of the most important [and] prominent places in Anishnaabe history and culture,\" says Eric Hemenway, an Anishnaabe member who has been instrumental in reviving Indigenous history on the island. \"The Anishnaabeek people have been at the Straits [the waterways connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan], some say, since time immemorial. And we are still at the place of our ancestors here at the Straits. The waters were, and continue to be, the highways of the Midwest.\"\nAs Hemenway points out, a large number of Indigenous burial sites have been found on the island \u2013 some of which go back roughly 3,000 years. \"[Mackinac] is one of our most sacred spots on the Great Lakes,\" he says.\nHemenway has also worked on the development of the Biddle House, which is home to the Mackinac Island Native American Museum that opened in 2021.\n\"My biggest success [metric] is when I see other Native people come through\u2026 this is our story,\" says Hemenway. \"[The island has] a touristy perception now, but the layers to this place are there.\"\nBy the late 19th Century, Mackinac Island had become a playground for wealthy industrialist families from Chicago, Detroit and other parts of the once-thriving Midwest, who flocked to the island in summer to unwind in its pristine waters.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that speaks Elizabethan English\n\u2022 Dearborn, Michigan: A visit to the first Arab-majority city in the US\nMackinac's 138-year-old Grand Hotel has individually decorated rooms and claims to have the world's longest porch; it's also one of the last fully functioning hotels from industrial America's Gilded Age. Such is the Grand Hotel's unique appeal that Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer recently took to X to pitch the island as the location for season four of HBO's The White Lotus.\nWhile the pitch was playful, Morse is hesitant for Mackinac to become overtouristed. \"You're proud of where you live; but at the same time I kind of don't want to tell people how cool it is here,\" she says.\nIndeed, this pint-sized island packs a punch. Eighty percent of Mackinac's land area is comprised of Mackinac Island State Park, where visitors can stroll through old-growth forest, admire towering limestone pillars, and hike, bike or hire a horse-drawn carriage to photograph one of the island's most famous attractions \u2013 the 50ft-wide Arch Rock.\nElsewhere, locals suggest heading north from the island's one village to ramble the 8.5-mile highway turned bike-and-hiking trail that runs the circumference of the island and offers views of the five-mile-long Mackinac suspension bridge and access to quiet pebble-covered beaches and woodlands.\nHorses aside, the island's 1,500 bikes for hire\u00a0are the main way residents and visitors get around \u2013 a self-propelled mode of transport that suggests Mackinac residents are happy to move at a different pace than the rest of the country.\nLiving in a place without cars is one of the main reasons why Morse, who rides her bike nine months of the year, has decided to live year-round on the island, despite the harsh winters.\n\"I just love the idea of getting on my bike and coming down [to the village] through the trees. It sets me for the day,\" she says. \"You are always greeting and talking to people.\"\nBut while cycling is the easiest and most popular mode of transport, bikes clearly play a secondary role in powering the island.\n\"Without the horses, this place wouldn't be what it is. It's what makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when you get off the boat and you hear that 'clip-clop',\" says Hunter Hoaglund, who works at Arnold Freight, a company that has run a ferry service to the island for 140 years and ships in a herd of its horses that overwinter on Michigan's Upper Peninsula every April. \"We have our trucks show up here each day [dropping off the horses], and within the next month we'll probably see 200 to 300 more show up.\" An estimated 20-30 horses remain on the island during the winter to collect garbage, deliver packages and otherwise keep the island running. \u00a0\u00a0\nSurrounded by crystal-clear water, Mackinac can be periodically cut off from the mainland in winter when ice floes can halt ferry services to or from the island.\nBut in spring and summer, Mackinac comes alive.\nThe dozens of lilac trees dotted along the village streets start to bloom in the lead up to the island's popular 10-day Lilac Festival in June. Stargazers head to Mackinac's Fort Holmes \u2013 the highest point on the island \u2013 and the Grand Hotel's Cupola Bar for unfiltered views of the northern Michigan night sky. But for most visitors, happily tuckered out after biking around the island, an ice cream or piece of fudge is best enjoyed overlooking the marina.\nAnd all without the sound of a car engine to spoil the experience.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "In the 20 years since its creation, YouTube has grown from humble beginnings to billions of videos being watched every day - but can posting videos on the platform offer a viable career? We spoke to some of South Yorkshire's favourite creators about how the website changed their lives.\nRuth Amos from Sheffield runs Kids Invent Stuff. The channel has 71,000 followers and has been going since 2015. \nPrimary school children send in their invention ideas and Ruth and her colleague Shawn bring them to life.\n\"There's lots of different ways that you can make money from YouTube, there's ads, sponsors, collaborators or you can have things like Patreon, where people support the work that you're doing. \n\"Quite often, it you're a content creator you do a lot of those different ways, not just one of those things,\" she says.\n\"When I was growing up you couldn't watch someone's channel about robot making or cookery and that's what's amazing about YouTube \u2013 all of our hobbies have found a home on there as well as some of those viral moments.\"\nThe channel has run collaborations with Channel 4 TV show Taskmaster and had a go at breaking Guinness World Records. \nAccording to Ofcom, more than 80% of three to 17-year-olds use the site. A survey by the Lego Group in 2019 suggested a third of young Britons and Americans wanted to be vloggers. \nHowever, there are more than 100 million channels on the site - some with only a handful of followers or video watches.\nWould Ruth recommend the career to the children who send her their invention ideas? \n\"I think it is a career anyone can do because if you're interested in creating content, and you're creative, it's actually something lots of people can have a go at,\" she says. \n\"If someone wants to be a YouTuber I would also think about your other skills, because some of the most popular channels are channels where people are filming themselves doing something else. So think about your skill.\"\nLee Hinchcliffe, from Barnsley, has been filming content for the platform since he was 15. \nHe began with gaming videos before trying skit videos and then challenge videos.\nHis channel took off when he started playing McDonald's Monopoly. He spent hundreds of pounds at the chain trying to win a \u00a310,000 prize ticket. \n\"I never won it, I lost a lot of money, but people saw that video,\" he says.\n\"I've always had the love of creating videos and entertaining all my life, so that's why I've gone at it since school.\n\"YouTube is my university and I got my degree there, because you can watch back everything I've done.\" \nOff the back of his channel, Lee became a TV presenter with CBBC, starring on screen alongside madcap puppet Hacker T Dog. \nHe said his YouTube experience had made the switch to television much easier. \n\"Instead of doing a screen test and auditions, it was like, 'we've seen your videos, here's your mic, here's your earpiece, off you pop',\" he says.\n\"It's an obsession and it's grown into a career I'm able to do every day. There's no switch off because it's hard to switch off from something you love so much, and it needs constant plate spinning.\"\nSteve Garbutt, 55, runs Yorkshire Car Restoration in Doncaster with his son Shane.\nThe pair have been creating YouTube videos for the past five years and their business has boomed.\nSteve says they had gone from a 1,000ft warehouse to 10,000ft - and from three or four cars to more than 40.\n\"You have to put many hours into YouTube, because you not only have to do the work, you've got to change camera and lighting, and you're doubling your work load. Then you've got to go home and edit all your footage,\" he says.\n\"I've always been a bit of a techy, I like my gadgets and things. My original training when I left school was in computers. And then at 21 I changed careers because I thought there was too many people doing it.\"\nThey began on the platform by offering free car restoration to famous YouTubers such as Mat Armstrong, who has 4.5m followers.\n\"You've got to be very clever, you've got to look where the opportunities are. Rather than money it gives you a lot of opportunities. \n\"Our first opportunities were to restore famous YouTubers' cars free of charge, in exchange we got them advertising for us and sending us people to watch.\"\nThey have also worked with The Stig from Top Gear, Mike Brewer from Wheeler Dealers and Jonny Smith from The Late Brake Show.\nOriginally they hoped the channel would make money but they soon found the support they received more rewarding.\n\"We get so many good comments it makes you want to make another video. Even if the financial reward isn't there, because unless you're someone like Mat Armstrong it's not as profitable as everybody thinks,\" Steve says.\n\"The amount of hours you put in doesn't warrant that kind of money, you should be paid more. But the reward is massive.\n\"I would encourage someone not to just do YouTube, to make sure they get a career and base their YouTube on something they love.\n\"Don't think your niche is going to explode and make you famous.\"\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North",

        "article_text": "Israel's destructive military campaign in Gaza has released a silent killer: asbestos.\nThe mineral, once widely-used in building materials, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer.\nNowadays, its use is banned across much of the world, but it is still present in many older buildings. \nIn Gaza, it is found primarily in asbestos roofing used across the territory's eight urban refugee camps - which were set up for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war - according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\nIn October 2024, UNEP estimated that up to 2.3 million tons of rubble across Gaza could be contaminated with asbestos. \n\"The Gaza rubble is a very, very toxic environment,\" says Professor Bill Cookson, director of the National Centre for Mesothelioma Research in London. \"People are going to suffer acutely, but also in the longer term as well, things that children may carry throughout their lives.\"\n\"The lives lost now are not going to end here. The legacy is going to continue,\" says Liz Darlison, CEO of Mesothelioma UK.  \nWhen asbestos is disturbed by something like an air strike, its fibres - too small to see with the human eye - can be breathed in by those nearby and can then work their way through to the lining of the lungs.\nOver many years - usually decades - they can cause scarring which leads to a serious lung condition known as asbestosis, or, in some cases, an aggressive form of lung-cancer named mesothelioma.\n\"Mesothelioma is a terrible, intractable illness,\" says Prof Cookson.\n\"The really worrying thing,\" he adds, \"is that it's not dose related. So even small inhalations of asbestos fibre can cause subsequent mesothelioma.\n\"It grows within the pleural cavity. It's extremely painful. It's always diagnosed late. And it's pretty well resistant to all treatments.\"\nTypically, those who contract mesothelioma do so 20 to 60 years after exposure - meaning it will take decades before the possible impact across the territory is felt. A higher level, or longer period, of exposure is believed to accelerate the progression of the disease.\nDr Ryan Hoy, whose research into dust inhalation was cited by the UNEP, says it is extremely difficult to avoid breathing in asbestos fibres because they are \"really tiny particles that float in the air that can get very, very deep into the lungs.\"\nThey are even harder to avoid, he says, because Gaza is so \"densely populated\". The territory houses approximately 2.1 million people and is 365 sq km (141 sq miles) - about one quarter of the size of London.\nExperts on the ground there say people are unable to manage the risks posed by asbestos or dust inhalation due to the more immediate dangers of Israel's military offensive. \n\"At this point in time, [dust inhalation] is not something that is perceived as a worrying thing by the population. They even don't have things to eat, and they're more afraid to be killed by the bombs,\" says Chiara Lodi, medical co-ordinator in Gaza for the NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. \n\"The lack of awareness about the risks of asbestos, combined with the ongoing challenges [people in Gaza] face in trying to rebuild their lives, means they are unable to take the necessary measures to protect themselves,\" a Gaza-based spokesperson for the NGO SOS Children's Villages said. \nMany are \"not fully aware of the harmful effects of the dust and debris\", they added. \nAfter a previous conflict in Gaza in 2009, a UN survey of the territory found asbestos in debris from older buildings, sheds, temporary building extensions, roofs and the walls of livestock enclosures.\nThere are several types of asbestos ranging from so-called \"white asbestos\", which is the least dangerous, to \"blue\", or crocidolite, which is the most. Highly-carcinogenic crocidolite asbestos was previously found in Gaza by the UN.\nGlobally, around 68 countries have banned the use of asbestos, though some maintain exemptions for special use. It was banned in the UK in 1999, and Israel banned its use in buildings in 2011.\nAs well as mesothelioma, asbestos can cause other forms of lung cancer, larynx and ovarian cancer. \nA further, lesser known risk is that of silicosis, a lung disease caused by breathing in silica dust, usually over many years. Concrete generally contains 20-60% silica.\nDr Hoy says the sheer amount of dust in Gaza could lead to an \"increased risk of respiratory tract infections, upper and lower airway infections, pneumonia, exacerbations of pre-existing lung disease like asthma,\" as well as, \"emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be worsened by acute exposure to dust\".\nFor years, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York have been used as a case-study by health experts to examine the effects of a large toxic dust-cloud on a civilian population.\n\"The Twin Towers were not in the middle of a war zone,\" says Ms Darlison, \"so it was something we were able to measure and quantify easier\".\nAs of December 2023, 5,249 of those who were registered with the US government's World Trade Center Health Programme have died as a result of aerodigestive illness or cancer - a far higher figure than the 2,296 people who were killed in the attack itself. A total of 34,113 people were diagnosed with cancer over the same period. \nThe US and a group of Arab States have proposed competing plans for the reconstruction of Gaza. The UN has warned that the process will have to be managed carefully to avoid disturbing the vast amounts of asbestos-contaminated rubble.\n\"Unfortunately,\" says Ms Darlison, \"the very properties that made us use so much of it are the properties that make it difficult to get rid of.\" \nA UNEP spokesperson told the BBC that the debris removals process will \"increase the likelihood of asbestos disturbance and the release of hazardous fibres into the air\". \nA UNEP assessment indicated that clearing all debris could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2 billion (\u00a3929m).\nThe Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 that killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 people taken hostage. \nIsrael's offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. \nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.

In the text chain, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top US officials discussed the details of an upcoming attack against the Houthis. \nThe scandal rocked the White House.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said Russia and Ukraine \"are very close to a deal\", hours after his envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks in Moscow.\nTrump said it had been a \"good day\" of negotiations, while the Kremlin described the talks - which Ukraine was not present at - as \"constructive\".\nEarlier, Trump said on social media that \"most of the major points are agreed to,\" and urged Russia and Ukraine to meet \"at very high levels\" and \"to finish it [the deal] off\".\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his video address late on Friday that \"real pressure on Russia is needed\" to accept an unconditional ceasefire.\nEarlier in the day, Zelensky told the BBC that territorial issues between Kyiv and Moscow could be discussed if a \"full and unconditional ceasefire\" was agreed upon.\nReports suggest Ukraine would be expected to give up large portions of land annexed by Russia under a US peace proposal. \nTrump - who spoke to reporters as he arrived in Rome for Saturday's funeral of Pope Francis - has said he would support Russia keeping the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014. Zelensky rejects this idea.\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls almost 20% of Ukrainian territory.\nOn Friday, traffic was halted in Moscow as a convoy of cars carrying Witkoff arrived ahead of the high-level talks, the fourth such visit he has made to Russia since the start of the year.\nThe three-hour talks were described as \"very useful\" by Putin aide Yuri Ushakov.\nIt had brought the \"Russian and US positions closer together, not just on Ukraine but also on a range of other international issues\", he said.\n\"Specifically on the Ukrainian crisis, the possibility of resuming direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives was in particular discussed,\" he added.\nEarlier this week, Putin signalled for the first time since the early stages of the war that he was open to talks with Zelensky.\nHis remarks were believed to be in response to a proposal by the Ukrainian president for a 30-hour Easter truce to be extended for 30 days. No truce has yet been agreed on.\nKyiv has been on the receiving end of growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of an agreement with Moscow to end the war.\nCrimea has become a particular flashpoint.\nZelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea of recognising the peninsula as part of Russia, telling reporters in Kyiv on Friday: \"Our position is unchanged - only the Ukrainian people have the right to decide which territories are Ukrainian.\"\nHowever, in later remarks he suggested to the BBC that \"a full and unconditional ceasefire opens up the possibility to discuss everything\".\nHe also referenced comments made by Trump in an interview with Time magazine, in which the US president said \"Crimea will stay with Russia\".\n\"What President Trump says is true, and I agree with him in that today we do not have enough weapons to return control over the Crimean peninsula,\" Zelensky said.\nWashington's peace plan has not been publicly released, but reports suggest it proposes Russia keeps the land it has gained - a condition that is in Moscow's favour.\nOn Friday, Reuters news agency reported it had seen US proposals handed to European officials last week, as well as subsequent counter-proposals from Europe and Ukraine.\nIt said there are significant disparities between them.\nThe US deal offers American legal acceptance of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas, including all of the Luhansk region.\nBy contrast, the Europeans and Ukrainians will only discuss what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory after a ceasefire has come into effect.\nThe US plan also rules out Ukraine's membership in the Nato military alliance, according to Reuters.\nAs the meeting between Witkoff and Putin was taking place, Trump claimed talks were going in the right direction.\n\"They're meeting with Putin right now, as we speak, and we have a lot of things going on, and I think in the end we're going to end up with a lot of good deals, including tariff deals and trade deals,\" he told reporters in the US.\nHe said his aim was to bring about an end to fighting in Ukraine which he said was claiming the lives of 5,000 Ukrainian and Russians a week, adding he believed \"we're pretty close\" to a peace deal.\nTrump also said Zelensky had not signed the \"final papers on the very important Rare Earths Deal with the United States\". \n\"It is at least three weeks late,\" he said, adding that he hoped it would be signed \"immediately\".\nThe long-talked of minerals deal, which would give the US a stake in Ukraine's abundant natural resource deposits, was meant to be signed in February but was derailed after an acrimonious meeting between Trump and Zelensky in Washington.\nRussia and Ukraine's positions in securing a peace deal still seem miles apart, with no representative from Ukraine invited to take part in the talks in Moscow.\nWriting on social media on Friday, Zelensky criticised Russia for failing to agree to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US on 11 March and urged allies to apply more pressure to it.\n\"It's been 45 days since Ukraine agreed to President Trump's proposal for quiet in the sky, sea and the frontline,\" he said. \"Russia rejects all this. Without pressure this cannot be resolved. Pressure on Russia is necessary.\"\nHe said Russia was being allowed to import missiles from countries such as North Korea, which he said it then used in a deadly missile strike on Kyiv on Thursday, which killed 12 people and injured dozens.\n\"Insufficient pressure on North Korea and its allies allows them to make such ballistic missiles. The missile that killed the Kyiv residents contained at least 116 parts imported from other countries, and most of them, unfortunately, were made by US companies,\" Zelensky alleged.\nFollowing the attack on Kyiv, Trump said he was \"putting a lot of pressure\" on both sides to end the war, and directly addressed Putin in a post on social media, saying: \"Vladimir STOP!\"\nSince then, however, Trump has blamed Kyiv for starting the war, telling Time magazine: \"I think what caused the war to start was when they [Ukraine] started talking about joining Nato.\"\nAhead of the talks between Witkoff and Putin, a senior Russian general was killed in a car bomb attack in the Russian capital. The Kremlin accused Ukraine of being responsible. Kyiv has not commented.",

        "article_text": "The west Belfast rap group Kneecap have hit back at a call for their US visas to be revoked after their performance at Coachella where they ended their set with pro-Palestinian messages.\nWriting on social media, TV personality and music manager Sharon Osbourne said the hip-hop trio \"took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements\".\nWhen asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: \"Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.\"\nThe festival's organisers have also been approached for comment.\nKneecap have been vocal supporters of the Palestinian people, often raising the conflict in their live performances.\nHamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages.\nIsrael launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to figures released by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe number of children who have been killed in Gaza is disputed. International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.\nSpeaking to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 , Kneecap's manager said: \"If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.\"\nDaniel Lambert added: \"Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.\"\nHe also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as \"too severe to get into\".\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that \"may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted\".\nThe band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.\nOn Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included \"projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech\".\n\"This band openly support terrorist organizations,\" she added.\nMs Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).\n\"Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,\" Osbourne said.\n\"However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,\" she continued.\n\"This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\" Osbourne said.\n\"I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,\" she said.\nOsbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.\nShe also managed her husband's solo career.\nOsbourne finished her post by saying: \"As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.\n\"I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.\" \nThe festival organisers have been approached for comment.\nWarning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive\nAt the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.\nThe first message said: \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" followed by: \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,\" and a final screen added: \"[Expletive] Israel. Free Palestine.\"\nDuring the performance, band member Mo Chara said: \"The Irish not so long ago were persecuted at the hands of the Brits, but we were never bombed from the... skies with nowhere to go.\n\"The Palestinians have nowhere to go.\"\nThe band also led the audience in chants of: \"Free, free Palestine\".\nOn 11 April, during Kneecap's first Coachella performance, the group faced criticism after leading an anti-Margaret Thatcher chant - which was subsequently omitted from the festival's livestream - along with calls for a united Ireland.\nA US State Department spokesperson said: \"Due to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally will not comment on department actions with respect to specific cases.\"\nThey said the Trump administration \"is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process\".\n\"When considering revocations, the department looks at information that arises after the visa was issued that may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted,\" they added.\n\"This can include everything from arrests, criminal convictions, and engaging in conduct that is inconsistent with the visa classification, to an overstay.\"",

        "article_text": "The threat to Canada's sovereignty from US President Donald Trump has dominated the election, but the country also faces a challenge from within. Some western Canadians, fed up with a decade of Liberal rule, are openly calling for separation.\nStanding in front of a crowd of about 100 squeezed into a small event hall in the city of Lethbridge, Dennis Modry is asking locals about Alberta's future.\nWho thinks Alberta should have a bigger role in Canada, he asks? A dozen or so raise their hands.\nWho thinks the province should push for a split from Canada and form its own nation? About half the crowd raise their hands.\n\"How many people would like Alberta to join the US?\" Another show of support from half the crowd.\nMr Modry, a retired heart surgeon, is a co-leader of the Alberta Prosperity Project, a grassroots organisation pushing for an independence referendum.\nThe possibility of a split has long been a talking point in this conservative-leaning province. But two factors have given it new momentum: Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state, and the subsequent boost that has given the Liberal Party in the polls ahead of Monday's federal election.\nMr Modry told the BBC the separatist movement has grown in recent months - driven in part, he believes, by the president's rhetoric.\n\"We're not interested in that\", he said. \"We're interested in Alberta sovereignty.\"\nJeffrey Rath, however - a lawyer and rancher from Calgary who is another of the project's co-founders - was not as dismissive of Trump's 51st state suggestion. Although he agrees independence is the priority, he could see a future where Alberta joined with the US.\n\"We have a lot more culturally in common with our neighbours to the south in Montana\u2026 [and] with our cousins in Texas, than we do anywhere else,\" he said.\nPreviously on the political fringes, the possibility of a unity crisis is now being discussed out in the open.\nIn an opinion piece for national newspaper the Globe and Mail, Preston Manning - an Albertan considered one of the founders of the modern conservative movement in Canada - warned \"large numbers of Westerners simply will not stand for another four years of Liberal government, no matter who leads it\".\nAccusing the party of mismanaging national affairs and ignoring the priorities of western Canadians, he added: \"A vote for the Carney Liberals is a vote for Western secession \u2013 a vote for the breakup of Canada as we know it.\"\nThis sense of \"western alienation\", a term used to describe the feeling that the region is often overlooked by politicians in Canada's capital, is nothing new. For decades, many in the oil and gas-rich prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskachtewan have bemoaned how they are underrepresented, despite the region's economic significance for the country as a whole.\nThat resentment grew under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, which brought in environmental policies some Albertans view as a direct attack on the region's economic growth.\nNational polls suggest the Liberals, now under the leadership of Mark Carney, could be headed for their fourth consecutive win come election day on Monday. That it could come in part because of a surge of support in Ontario and Quebec - the eastern provinces where so much of the population is concentrated - only adds to the regional divide.\nJudy Schneider, whose husband works in the oil industry in Calgary, told the BBC she would vote \"yes\" in an independence referendum.\nShe said she didn't see Carney, who spent much of the last decade away from Canada but was raised in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, as a westerner.\n\"He can come and say 'I'm from Alberta,' but is he?\" Ms Schneider said.\nAn independent Alberta remains an unlikely prospect - a recent Angus Reid poll suggested that only one in four Albertans would vote to leave Canada if a referendum were held now. A majority of Canadians, however, feel the issue should be taken seriously, a separate Nanos poll indicated.\nPolitical analysts say the divide will pose a challenge to the country's next prime minister, especially if Carney wins. And even a victory for Calgary-born Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre would \"not solve the imbalance that presently exists between the East and the West,\" Mr Modry, the activist, said.\nThat wider sentiment has pushed Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who leads the United Conservative Party, to strike her own path in trade talks with the US, while other provincial leaders and the federal government have co-ordinated their efforts closely. She even visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.\nIn Canada, Smith has publicly warned of a \"national unity crisis\" if Alberta's demands - which centre around repealing Trudeau-era environmental laws to accelerate oil and gas production - are not met by the new prime minister within six months of the election.\nWhile Smith has dismissed talk of outright separation as \"nonsense\", critics have accused her of stoking the flames at such a consequential time for Canada's future.\nEven those within the separatist movement have different ideas on how best to achieve their goals.\nLorna Guitton, a born-and-bred Albertan and a volunteer with the Alberta Prosperity Project, told the BBC in Lethbridge that her aim was for the province to have a better relationship with the rest of Canada.\nShe described the current union as \"broken\", and believes a referendum, or the threat of it, will give Albertans \"leverage\" in future negotiations with Ottawa.\nBut Ms Guitton also dismissed any notion of it becoming a 51st US state.\n\"They've got enough of their own problems. Why would I want to be part of that?\" she said. \"I would rather be my own independent, sovereign province, or a province with a better deal in Canada.\"\nAt his ranch outside of Calgary in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Mr Rath has a different view. \nAs he tended to his race horses, he spoke of the political and social attitudes of free enterprise and small government that are shared by Albertans and many Americans.\n\"From that perspective, I would see Alberta as being a good fit within the United States,\" he said.\nHe is currently putting together a \"fact-finding\" delegation to travel to Washington DC and bring the movement directly to the Trump administration.\nMany voters in Alberta, however, dismiss the notion of independence altogether, even if they agree that the province has been overlooked.\nSteve Lachlan from Lethbridge agrees the West lacks representation in Ottawa but said: \"We already have separation, and we need to come together.\"\nAnd the Liberals are not entirely shut out from the province. Polls suggest that Alberta may send more Liberal MPs to Ottawa than in 2021, partly due to changing demographics that led to the creation of new ridings in urban Edmonton and Calgary.\nJames Forrester, who lives in the battleground Calgary Centre district, told the BBC he had traditionally voted Conservative but has leaned left in recent years. This time, he will vote Liberal because of the \"Carney factor\".\n\"I feel he's the best guy to deal with Trump,\" he said.

That it could come in part because of a surge of support in Ontario and Quebec - the eastern provinces where so much of the population is concentrated - only adds to the regional divide.Judy Schneider, whose husband works in the oil industry in Calgary, told the BBC she would vote \"yes\" in an independence referendum.She said she didn't see Carney, who spent much of the last decade away from Canada but was raised in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, as a westerner. \"From that perspective, I would see Alberta as being a good fit within the United States,\" he said.He is currently putting together a \"fact-finding\" delegation to travel to Washington DC and bring the movement directly to the Trump administration.Many voters in Alberta, however, dismiss the notion of independence altogether, even if they agree that the province has been overlooked.Steve Lachlan from Lethbridge agrees the West lacks representation in Ottawa but said: \"We already have separation, and we need to come together. \"I would rather be my own independent, sovereign province, or a province with a better deal in Canada. \"We're not interested in that\", he said.",

        "article_text": "A dozen US states have joined together on a lawsuit aiming to block President Donald Trump's spate of tariffs that have upended global trade.\nThe suit, which is led by New York's governor and attorney general, argues that the president lacked the authority to impose the levies. It notes such tariffs must be approved by the US Congress. \nTwelve states joined the lawsuit, which was filed with the United States Court of International Trade. \nThe White House accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of \"prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump over protecting the safety and wellbeing of their constituents\".\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai added that the \"administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing\u2014both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.\"\nThe lawsuit states that tariffs must be approved by Congress and questioned Trump invoking a 1970s law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact the levies.  \n\"By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,\" the lawsuit states.\nTrump invoked the IEEPA as the basis for several of his tariffs against China, Mexico, Canada, and other countries. \nA president can use the law \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States,\" if he has first declared a national emergency.\nThe lawsuit argues that the law does not actually grant Trump the power he claims to derive from it. The act has never been used to issue tariffs by any president, congressional research shows.\nLast week, the state of California filed its own lawsuit against the Trump administration over tariffs. That lawsuit also argues that Trump lacks the power under the IEEPA to impose these tariffs. Several other lawsuits have similarly challenged Trump's authority using that law for the levies. \nTrump has implemented tariffs on global trading partners in a stated effort to correct what he believes is a trade deficit between the US and other nations. \nOn 2 April, in an event billed as \"Liberation Day,\" Trump shook the global economy by announcing \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations across the world. A few days later amid a market backlash, he announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs and lowered the rate to 10% for most countries. \nThat pause didn't extend to China, which Trump said had a \"lack of respect\" and was retaliating. Instead, the US issued a 145% on goods imported from China, which has led to a trade standoff and rattled global markets. \nOn Wednesday, Trump said he hoped to come to a deal with China soon and noted the 145% tariff was \"very high\". \nThe White House has also imposed 25% tariffs on certain goods from it's neighbours, Mexico and Canada.

        "article_text": "Canadians will head to the elections on 28 April, with polls suggesting a tight race between the ruling Liberals and the opposition Conservatives.\nWhile Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government.\nIt will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the frontrunners in the race are Liberal leader Mark Carney and leader of the Conservatives, Pierre Poilievre.\nHere is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major political parties.\nCarney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few weeks.\nHis party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader in early March. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation.\nFor many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.\nHe was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics. \nCarney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.\nBut Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first. \nHe is not as fluent in French as his opponents, though that has yet to be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec.\nHe has faced some criticism for taking multiple breaks during the campaign - amid a trade war with the US - to focus on his role as prime minister. \nPoilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time.\nSince then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada.\nHe is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their \"disastrous\" and \"woke\" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to \"common sense politics\" if his party were to form government.\nIt is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living. \nPoilievre led in national polls from mid-2023 until this March, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election. \nBut a series of events - Trudeau's resignation, Trump's inauguration, and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader - has made this election a much tighter race. \nPoilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the \"51st state\".\nPoilievre has sought to shift his messaging, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put \"Canada first\".\n\"I have a completely different story from Donald Trump,\" he said in a recent media appearance, highlighting his modest background. \nTrump himself has said that Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough\", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is a Quebec sovereignist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.\nStill, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.\nBlanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, and has called Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense.\n\"It's enough jibber-jabber,\" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs last month in Montreal. \"We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.\"\nOn domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table.\nHe has said he wants Quebec to be a strong ally with Canada in trade talks with the US. \nQuebec - with a large aluminium industry - has been hit hard by the US tariffs of 25%. \nStill, polling indicates the Bloc - who went into the election with 33 seats in Parliament -  have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.\nCBC's poll tracker suggests the Liberals are polling at around 43% in the province, and the Bloc around 23%. \nBlanchet has suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will \"come roaring back\" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.\nSingh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practicing Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.\nIn 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.\nThe NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.\nBut in late 2024, Singh tore up that \"supply and confidence\" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.\nAt the time, Singh had said that the Liberals \"let people down\" and didn't \"deserve another chance from Canadians\".\nBut his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls suggest that only 8.5% of Canadians nationally intend to vote for them as of mid-April.\nA big question will be whether the NDP will be able to retain the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status. \nIn the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338.",

In the text chain, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top US officials discussed the details of an upcoming attack against the Houthis. \nThe scandal rocked the White House. Then, in April, the New York Times and others reported that Hegseth had shared information about the same military action in a second private Signal group chat, which included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.\nTrump has continued to stand by his defence secretary and others involved in the incident, telling reporters earlier this week: \"Pete's doing a great job ...

That thread included information about the exact timings of the air strikes as well as the weaponry being used, before the attack had taken place. ",

        "article_text": "As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy.\nThere's a cold wind blowing from the \u00d8resund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in Helsing\u00f8r, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts.\u00a0\nThis windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds.\nThis year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April); Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take in Rupert Goold's production starring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2006.\u00a0\n\"There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,\" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.\u00a0\nAs a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that \"there's something rotten in the state of Denmark\" \u2013 the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure \u2013 it's hard to miss its appeal.\nToday, nothing looks rotten in Helsing\u00f8r \u2013 the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg \u2013\u00a0but he certainly knew it well.\n\"We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,\" she says. \"We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company.\"\nThey may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon \u2013 and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time.\nIn a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer \u2013 as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.\u00a0\nVisiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer, special tours invite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father \u2013 but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides.\nMore clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen.\n\"The first quarto \u2013 written very early in 1603 \u2013 is set in Denmark,\" said Steffensen, \"but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself.\"\nKing James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from \"The Lord Chamberlain's Men\" to \"The King's Men\" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play.\nWe climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in Helsing\u00f8r.\nLars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director of HamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell.\nHamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town's Shakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatre Schaub\u00fcne and a sell-out staging starring Jude Law.\nAs well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n\u2022 Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony\n\u2022 Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists \u2013 but does it actually work?\nA trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry \u2013 starring a young Claes Bang as Rosenkrantz \u2013 and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.\u00a0\n\"When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,\" said Engel. \"Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for.\"\nEngel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.\u00a0\nEngel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed by The Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.\u00a0\n\"This year we've taken a more classical approach,\" said Engel, \"because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it.\"\nIn testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said that every minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations.\n\"It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,\" says Harvey. \"A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people.\"\nVisiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the \"set\" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The creation of three \"dire wolf\" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.\nWhen news broke that Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based biotechnology company, had resurrected three extinct dire wolves, the internet reacted with awe. It is a species that last roamed the earth some 13,000 years ago, but has found recent fame thanks to Game of Thrones, which features fictional dire wolves.\nThe story was stoked further when a photograph of Game of Thrones author George R R Martin holding one of the adorable white pups was released. \"I have to say the rebirth of the direwolf has stirred me as no scientific news has since Neil Armstrong [walked] on the moon,\" Martin wrote on his blog.\nMartin, who is an investor in Colossal, added that more extinct species were on the way, including the woolly mammoth, Tasmanian tiger and dodo.\u00a0\nColossal \u2013 which is currently valued at $10bn (\u00a37.6bn) and is backed by high-profile donors such as Chris Hemsworth, Paris Hilton and the CIA \u2013 boldly states on its website that it's \"going to fix\" the problem of extinction.\nAccording to Matt James, the company's chief animal officer, the aim is not to create a Jurassic Park-like zoo full of extinct animals, but to reintroduce lost species back into the habitats they once occupied. Once those animals are settled in, Colossal expects them to exert positive change on their habitats. \"We're trying to focus on species that can have cascading effects on an ecosystem to improve stability, lift biodiversity and maybe even help with climate change buffering,\" James tells the BBC.\u00a0\u00a0\nDe-extinction has been talked about for decades. But Colossal's three dire wolves \u2013 which are actually grey wolves that possess 20 edited genes that are meant to give them dire wolf-like features \u2013 represent the most serious effort to date to make that lofty vision a reality.\nIn the wake of the dire wolf announcement, however, many scientists have criticised Colossal's approach. They see efforts to bring back long-extinct species as costly wastes of resources and a distraction from the significant work that's needed to save still-living species.\nThe BBC spoke with several experts in fields ranging from conservation biology to paleontology about efforts to resurrect species from extinction and whether they are likely to achieve the goals that Colossal hopes.\nChief among the concerns raised was that claiming it is possible to bring back extinct species may actually lead to more existing species being lost. It could give politicians and industries the idea that damage to the environment can be fixed by resurrecting species.\nSuch a message could be particularly damaging at a time when the US is withdrawing from international agreements on climate change and revoking measures intended protect the environment and wildlife, says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and independent consultant based in Washington, DC.\n\"It's beyond irresponsible for these people [Colossal] to be claiming some sort of conservation victory in this environment,\" he says.\nThis worry was quickly reinforced when Doug Burgum, the US Secretary of the Interior \u2013 who the Colossal team met with in advance of their dire wolf announcement \u2013 praised the company's work on X as a new \"bedrock for modern species conservation\". Burgum also criticised the ineffectiveness of the \"endangered species list\" \u2013 presumably a reference to the Red List of Threatened Species, drawn up by the International Union of Conservation (IUCN) or the list of threatened & endangered species maintained by branches of the US Government \u2013 thanks to what he characterised as a focus on regulation. \"Since the dawn of our nation, it has been innovation \u2013 not regulation \u2013 that has spawned American greatness,\" he wrote.\nBiodiversity is under a seemingly endless onslaught of threats, virtually all of which are imposed by humans. The leading reasons, according to the IUCN, are habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation from fishing and hunting, illegal wildlife trade, pollution and climate change.\nColossal claims that its de-extinction work will directly benefit conservation. But the company needs to tie its work to \"ameliorating, alleviating or reversing something that's on that list\" of threats to biodiversity, says Kent Redford, former director of the Wildlife Conservation Society who now works as an independent conservation consultant in Portland, Maine.\nWhile Colossal's de-extinction work is \"super-cool science,\" he continues, he does not see it alleviating any of the threats highlighted by the IUCN.\nColossal sees things otherwise. The company states on its website that woolly mammoths reintroduced to the Arctic, for example, will increase those habitats' resilience to climate change through their foraging behavior, which they say will help to keep carbon locked in permafrost in the ground. By scraping away snow, the company says, mammoths will expose the soil below to cold air, causing it to stay frozen.\u00a0\nHowever, Nitin Sekar, a conservation scientist with the Asian elephant specialist group at the IUCN, says he has struggled to find evidence in the scientific literature to support this claim. One study comparing carbon storage in the Arctic tundra to taiga forest found the soil in areas covered in trees could store nearly twice as much carbon overall. Only slightly more was found in the permafrost of the tundra than in the taiga. Nor could he find anything else about how mammoths might have affected carbon in general.\nSome research on existing species of arctic herbivores suggests that they can reduce permafrost thawing. One scoping study by researchers at the University of Oxford does point to the role mammoths had on the climate during the Pleistocene and suggests bison and horses could replicate some of that role. But those species need to be maintained at high densities \u2013 where they are fenced, fed and managed by humans \u2013 to have any protective effect. The Arctic ecosystem is also different today than it was in the Pleistocene, so it is also hard to say whether mammoth hybrids would have that same effect on today's landscape as species like caribou and reindeer.\nThere could be other ways that mammoths affect carbon levels. As temperatures increase, the act of trampling and scraping away snow could actually accelerate permafrost melting by exposing it to the Sun \u2013 an effect that some research suggests is already happening in wet lowlands in the Arctic.\u00a0\n\"Overall, with the data we have now, it's just impossible to know how mammoths affected their environment millennia ago, or how the mammoth-elephant hybrids will behave in our warmer future,\" Sekar says. \"It seems like a strange thing to gamble on in the face of an existential crisis, given the alternatives.\"\u00a0\nJames calls for more research to resolve these questions and show \"direct links and causation in a way that can help to bring the rest of the scientific community along on this journey\".\nDire wolves and woolly mammoths were driven extinct by the complex forces of a changing planet, not just by human activities. For species that humans are responsible for annihilating, though, simply bringing them back does not help to address the threats that pushed them to extinction in the first place, says Corinne Kendall, programme director for Southern Africa at the Peregrine Fund, a non-profit organisation that aims to conserve birds of prey around the world.\nModern conservationists recognise this and are increasingly focused on landscape-level solutions rather than saving a particular favourite species, Kendall adds.\n\"That's what's missing in the way Colossal is approaching this,\" she says. \"If you only address the genetics and technology side of things, it's interesting from a scientific discovery standpoint, but you're creating the trees without the forest.\"\nJulie Meachen, a vertebrate paleontologist and morphologist at Des Moines University in Iowa, believes, however, that the genetic techniques Colossal used to create its dire wolves are applicable to conservation. The company is also exploring ways to help still-living species such as the northern white rhino, elephants and endangered pigeons, she points out. \"These techniques could be applied to any species suffering from genetic diversity loss and to combat inbreeding or genetic bottlenecks in low population sizes,\" she says.\n\"I think the conservation work that Colossal is doing is far more important than the de-extinction work, but this conservation work does not get the same press coverage as the flashy de-extinction part,\" she adds. \"That is unfortunate.\"\nJames at Colossal agrees that de-extinction technologies are just \"one piece of a very complex puzzle\" that must also include things like habitat protection. But he says that attention-grabbing headlines about extinct species being brought back to life can act like \"a giant ship\" pulling \"all these other projects in its wake\".\u00a0\nIt is also important to be clear about what Colossal is actually able to achieve. It is unlikely to ever be possible to truly resurrect long-gone species like dire wolves or woolly mammoths, say scientists not involved with the company. Tissue samples from animals that have been extinct for tens of thousands of years lack the intact cells needed for traditional cloning techniques, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. \"What Colossal is engaging in is genetic modification of modern species to give them physical characteristics to make them look like extinct species.\"\u00a0\nThis in itself is a significant technical achievement, argues Colossal and its supporters.\nIn the case of the dire wolves, the three puppies it managed to breed are in reality \"genetically modified grey wolves\", say researchers. Essentially the genome of modern wolves was edited to replicate small segments of ancient DNA obtained from the fossilised remains of dire wolves. They are, the company admits, grey wolves with dire wolf characteristics.\nBut scientists have even questioned some of those characteristics.It's unlikely, for example, that dire wolves would have been white, but Colossal chose to make its animals white \"because of popular conceptions from Game of Thrones\", Gill says. \"This was an aesthetic choice, not a biological or scientific one.\"\nEven if Colossal did bring back animals that very closely resembled Ice Age species, they still would not be the same as the bona fide ones that lived thousands of years ago because the Pleistocene ecosystem they inhabited no longer exists, Meachen says. \"A dire wolf or any other species is not only its genes, but also its environment and all the other species living there.\"\nColossal says it has no plans of releasing dire wolves into the wild. But it does aspire to eventually repopulate parts of the Arctic with woolly mammoths. This would require engineering a lot of baby mammoth proxies, which the company plans to do by using Asian or African elephants as surrogates.\nIn the West especially, though, some people are starting to question the ethics of whether elephants \u2013 extremely intelligent, social and sentient beings \u2013 should be kept in captivity at all, much less be experimented on, Sekar says. Asian elephants in modern zoo facilities also frequently suffer from infertility and lose their calves to stillbirths and infanticides twice as often as elephants in semi-wild conditions, he says, while mothers deeply mourn dead calves. \"Are we really ok putting elephants through that so we can have these visually entertaining animals that aren't even real mammoths?\" asks Sekar.\nJames says that Colossal will have many quality control steps to ensure things go well for the elephants, and that the company will also be working with leading animal welfare experts to \"avoid potential welfare pitfalls ahead\".\u00a0\nColossal has not disclosed how much it invested in the dire wolf programme \u2013 but it's likely in the many millions of dollars. While costs of new technologies do eventually go down with scale, even if de-extinction does get cheaper, it will still be orders of magnitude more affordable and effective to stop species from going extinct in the first place, Shiffman says. Moreover, if the original drivers of extinction are not addressed, then de-extinct species could quickly become re-extinct, he warns.\nWhile Redford acknowledges that money is not fungible, if Colossal's primary goal really is conservation, then he says he has a hard time viewing its work on de-extinction as being \"the right investment to make\".\nFor every extinct species that Colossal is bringing back, however, James says the company is also investing in a surviving endangered species. Work is being done to introduce greater genetic diversity to populations of endangered red wolves in the US, for example, and to engineer elephants to be resistant to herpes virus.\u00a0\nBut while red wolves do have some issues with genetic diversity, their biggest threats are road collisions and human persecution, Kendall says. Without addressing \"how the animal is going to survive on the ground\", the genetic component becomes \"kind of irrelevant\".\u00a0\nHerpes also only kills a fraction of the number of wild Asian elephants each year compared to those killed by humans, says Sekar, , who has reviewed data from the Indian government about causes of elephant deaths. Around two wild elephants are known to die per year of herpes compared to around 100 killed in some way by humans, he says.\u00a0\nColossal could leverage its synthetic biology expertise in ways that are clear wins for the planet, experts say. Crops that are engineered to more efficiently take up nitrogen, for example, could be a huge boon for reducing the steep climate costs of nitrogen fertiliser and lessening the major dead zones that its runoffs cause in water bodies. Finding ways to engineer high quality animal proteins for human consumption could, likewise, be a game-changer for alleviating the many environmental and animal welfare concerns that plague the livestock industry, the experts say.\u00a0\n\"Colossal clearly has very talented biologists on their team,\" Sekar says. \"If they were to turn their attention to addressing problems like that, they could really be the heroes of conservation.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The attack once again came off line-out ball and the forwards showed good patience, keeping it tight until Pyrs pounced from close range.\nBevan added the conversion to give Wales a 12-10 half-time lead, the first time this campaign they went down the tunnel ahead.\nBut the optimism was short-lived as Italy came out with a change of tactic as they chose to engage in a kicking battle with George.\nIt almost paid off with a chip setting up Giordana Duca, who would have been through if not for a last-gasp tap tackle from Jasmine Joyce-Butchers.\nItaly kept coming with wave after wave of attack as Wales struggled to live with their offloading game and when points were on offer Silari took the opportunity to kick Italy back in front.\nLynn responded by making some early changings, with Alex Callender, Hannah Bluck and Carys Phillips all coming on to the field.\nBut they were not able to make an impact as Italy kept piling on the pressure and managed to get the ball out wide to Granzotto, who did well to ride the defensive tackle and get the ball down in the corner.\nWales desperately needed to get a foothold, but they could not live with the scintillating Azzurre attack.\nItaly went for the jugular and opted for a tap penalty in front of posts, and while the defence did well to repel the charging Sara Tounesi, they could not prevent Turani from stretching over the line.\nThe fourth try came from the full-back Minuzzi, whose outstanding 50-22 launched Italy upfield. The forwards then carried hard before Minuzzi ran a fine line to cut through the defence.\nWales were reduced to 14 players when Natalia John was sent to the sin bin for a high tackle, and took full advantage as Granzotto completed another fine finish in the corner while Muzzo crossed at the death to pile on the misery.\nWales captain Hannah Jones said: \"We're hurt.\n\"We know we can be better than that, we have to learn fast and be better.\n\"We cannot be in this position again.\n\"We need to get a good preseason under our belt and work on key areas, but right now I'm just gutted.\"\nItaly: Vittoria Ostuni Minuzzi; Aura Muzzo, Michela Sillari, Sara Mannini, Alyssa D'Inc\u00e1; Veronica Madia, Sofia Stefan; Silvia Turani, Vittoria Vecchini, Sara Tounesi, Giordana Duca, Beatrice Veronese, Francesca Sgorbini, Elisa Giordano (capt).\nReplacements: Desiree Spinelli, Emanuela Stecca, Gaia Maris, Isabella Locatelli, Alissa Ranuccini, Alia Bitonci, Beatrice Rigoni, Francesca Granzotto.\nWales: Jasmine Joyce-Butchers; Lisa Neumann, Hannah Jones (capt), Courtney Keight, Carys Cox; Lleucu George, Keira Bevan; Gwenllian Pyrs, Kelsey Jones, Donna Rose, Abbie Fleming, Gwen Crabb, Kate Williams, Bethan Lewis, Georgia Evans.\nReplacements: Carys Phillips, Maisie Davies, Jenni Scoble, Natalia John, Alex Callender, Sian Jones, Hannah Bluck, Catherine Richards.\nSin bin: Natalia John (76 mins)",
