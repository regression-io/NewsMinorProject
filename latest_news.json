        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

        "summary": "- KateMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.The stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.This is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.However, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.This was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.Of course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.This is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.Some people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. \"So Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.Why can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. \"Verstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".The guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option.",

These were 10-year-olds,\" one teacher said.\nAnother teacher said: \"In a secondary English class last year, a group of boys opted, despite discouragement, to write a persuasive essay on why Andrew Tate is the GOAT (greatest of all time) which included praise of his view that women are a man's property... all of the parents were contacted and were appalled.\"\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2023, when pushed on whether his controversial views on women harmed young people, Tate claimed he was a \"force for good\". \nPatrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said \"there is an urgent need for concerted action involving schools, colleges and other agencies to safeguard all children and young people from the dangerous influence of far-right populists and extremists\".\n\"Teachers cannot be left alone to deal with these problems,\" he added.\nBut the founder of a group which trains professionals in how to work with boys and young men said the access young people have to pornography is \"way more impactful\" than the influence of people like Tate.\nMichael Conroy, who launched Men at Work in 2019, told BBC Breakfast: \"Without porn, Andrew Tate would not be a known name.\n\"Our boys, sadly, are learning about sex through porn, and it is usually representing to them a difference of power between men and women. \n\"That chimes when they see work from people like Andrew Tate.

It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "A Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration has been moved to a new prison, US Senator Chris Van Hollen has said.\nThe Democratic senator was speaking after returning from El Salvador where he met Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, who was sent to the notorious mega-jail Cecot (Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism) last month.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was \"traumatised\" and fearful of other prisoners while inside the facility, Van Hollen said, adding that he was moved to another facility in the country over a week ago.\nThe Supreme Court has ordered the government to \"facilitate\" his return, however Trump administration officials have continued to push back against the order.\nThe White House accuses him of being a member of the transnational Salvadoran gang MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organisation, and has said he will not return to the US. \nOn Sunday, Van Hollen appeared on all major US Sunday morning programmes to express his frustration with how the Trump administration has handled Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's mistaken deportation. \n\"I am not defending the man,\" he said in an interview with ABC News. \"I'm defending the rights of this man to due process.\"\nVan Hollen stressed that he went to El Salvador to ensure both the rule of law and the right to due process before the courts are upheld. \"If we take it away from [Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda], we do jeopardise it for everybody else,\" he said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has never been convicted of a crime. His family and attorneys have fiercely denied he is a member of MS-13. \nVan Hollen said he was initially blocked from meeting Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda by Salvadoran authorities.

        "article_text": "He had tea with the Queen, was blessed by the Pope and spread Hawaiian culture across the globe. More than a century later, a festival dubbed the \"Olympics of hula\" honours his legacy.\nSilence engulfed the audience at Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, Hawai'i, as a group of hula dancers appeared on stage. They moved gracefully in unison, rhythmically depicting a scene of an ancient Hawaiian myth as they bellowed \nmele\n (chants). The hula performance, which was part of the annual \nMerrie Monarch Festival\n, wasn't a mere spectacle; it was a powerful celebration of Hawaiian culture \u2013 and for years, it was banned.\nThe week-long Merrie Monarch Festival (which takes place 20-26 April 2025 and is celebrating its 62nd anniversary) has been called the \"\nOlympics of hula\n\" and perpetuates the sacred, centuries-old practice of dancing and chanting that preserves and portrays our native Hawaiian language, history, religion and culture. Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 best \nh\u0101lau\n (hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.\n\"It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,\" said K\u016b Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. \"And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King Kal\u0101kaua.\"\nFondly dubbed \"The Merrie Monarch\", King David La'amea Kal\u0101kaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislature\u00a0decided to elect a native\u00a0ali'i\u00a0(noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and Kal\u0101kaua took the oath of office the following day.\nBy the time of Kal\u0101kaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed \"vile heathen chants\".\nKal\u0101kaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the motto Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0(Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians \u2013 all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As Kal\u0101kaua famously proclaimed: \"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\"\u00a0\nTo many people around the world, \"hula\" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians \u2013 an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.\nAs part of Kal\u0101kaua's Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and l\u016b'au \u2013\u00a0all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later, \nho'opa'a \n(chanters) and \n'\u014dlapa \n(dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity Kal\u0101kaua revived.\n\"[Kal\u0101kaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,\" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have the \nKumulipo\n (a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, Kal\u0101kaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the \"Merrie Monarch\" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring by\u00a0spending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.\nDuring Kal\u0101kaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds of\u00a0Hawai'i Pono'\u012b\u00a0(the Kingdom's national anthem, which Kal\u0101kaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, Kal\u0101kaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.\u00a0'Iolani Palace\u00a0(which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights \u2013 five years before the White House did.\n\"He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],\" said Kenneth \"Aloha\" Victor, a kumu hula (master hula teacher) and designer of Kaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, Kal\u0101kaua maintained consulates and legations in more than 130 cities across the globe. The Kingdom had 13 consulates in Great Britain alone.\nBack at home, during an era of increased literacy, Kal\u0101kaua met with traditional na kahuna (priests) and na kapuna (elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book, Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The word embodying the spirit of Hawai'i\n\u2022 A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\nKal\u0101kaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of the Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art.\u00a0More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands: Princess Abigail Kaw\u0101nanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.\nA multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, Kal\u0101kaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be found hosting royal l\u016b'aus\u00a0for foreign dignitaries and heads of state.\nFor Hawaiians today, Kal\u0101kaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. \"When Kal\u0101kaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,\" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. \"It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.\"\nFor those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. \"Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,\" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.\nOf course, Kal\u0101kaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, l\u016b'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world. Visitors can experience this first hand at O'ahu's Polynesian Cultural Center, which hosts a traditional Hawaiian l\u016b'au paying homage to Queen Lili'uokalani (Kal\u0101kaua's sister, who succeeded him until white businessmen\u00a0overthrew the Kingdom in 1893), while the Queen Emma Summer Palace\u00a0in Honolulu offers contemporary hula lessons for adults.\nOn Maui, immersive experiences at the\u00a0Grand Wailea\u00a0include an E Ala E\u00a0oli\u00a0(chant) in the mornings on the beach, while interactive language lessons teach guests how to pronounce words in\u00a0\u02bb\u014clelo Hawai'i\u00a0(Hawaiian). Beachside resorts like\u00a0Outrigger Reef in Waikiki Beach are adopting a regenerative tourism approach at its A'o Cultural Center by allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and \u2013 yes \u2013 participate in hula lessons.\n\"It all spawns back to [King Kal\u0101kaua's] creed,\" said Victor. \"That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.\"\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story stated that\u00a0US sugar planters overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i. This statement has been corrected.\nThis article has been updated from its original 2023 publication.\n---\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0\n\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Shedeur Sanders was the initial favourite to be the first pick at the 2025 NFL Draft\nNFL Draft 2025\nVenue: Green Bay, Wisconsin Dates: Thursday, 24 April - Sunday, 26 April Start: 20:00 EDT (01:00 BST, Friday)\nCoverage: Live text commentary via the BBC Sport website and app from midnight\nThe wait is almost over for thousands of NFL hopefuls.\nAfter beginning to reshape their rosters during the free agency period, NFL teams will now select from the latest batch of players to emerge from the college game.\nThey have been scouting the top prospects for months, with fans and media speculating over who will pick who.\nNow dreams will come true this weekend as 257 players hear their name being called out at this year's NFL Draft.\nHow does the NFL draft work?\nAll 32 teams have one pick in each of the seven rounds - unless they have agreed trades - and they go in the reverse order of last season's standings, so the team with the worst record gets the first pick and the Super Bowl winners go last.\nGoing into the final game of last season, the New England Patriots were set for the first pick of the 2025 draft, but victory over a weakened Buffalo means they now have the fourth pick.\nThat left three teams on three wins from the 2024 season so the draft order was determined by the strength of their schedule - the record of their opponents.\nThe Tennessee Titans were therefore given the first pick, while the Cleveland Browns will choose second and the New York Giants third.\nWill Levis has failed to establish himself as Tennessee's starting quarterback and last season's back-up Mason Rudolph rejoined Pittsburgh in free agency, so the Titans are expected to go for a QB.\nAfter impressing the Titans at his pro day, potential first overall pick Cam Ward said \"I told them I was solidifying it today\"\nThere were a record six quarterbacks taken in the first 12 picks of last year's draft but a repeat is very unlikely.\nOnly two quarterbacks are among the highest-rated prospects in this year's draft class, namely Shedeur Sanders and Cam Ward.\nSanders was the initial favourite to be the first overall draft pick but was replaced by Ward in January, after he led Miami to a 10-3 season.\nThe 22-year-old racked up the most touchdown passes in college football (39) and the second-most passing yards (4,313) as he wrapped up a five-year college career, which included two-year stints with Incarnate Word and Washington State.\nWard, who is 6ft 2in, is now the clear favourite although Sanders could soon follow as the Giants also need a quarterback.\nAbdul Carter claimed 12 sacks and a total of 68 tackles in 16 games last season\nShedeur Sanders is the youngest son of former NFL star Deion Sanders, who was his head coach throughout his college career, which included two years at Jackson State followed by two at Colorado.\nThe 23-year-old's pass completion rate of 74.0% was the best in college football and helped Colorado to a 9-4 record.\nYet Ward and Oregon's Dillon Gabriel were the two quarterbacks among the four Heisman Trophy finalists, for the best college player, which was won by Sanders' team-mate Travis Hunter.\nThe 21-year-old has been dubbed a 'unicorn' as he is a genuine two-way player -

        "summary": "Who will be number one pick in the 2025 NFL draft?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Shedeur Sanders was the initial favourite to be the first pick at the 2025 NFL DraftBen CollinsBBC Sport journalistPublished22 April 2025182 CommentsNFL Draft 2025Venue: Green Bay, Wisconsin Dates: Thursday, 24 April - Sunday, 26 April Start: 20:00 EDT (01:00 BST, Friday)Coverage: Live text commentary via the BBC Sport website and app from midnightThe wait is almost over for thousands of NFL hopefuls.After beginning to reshape their rosters during the free agency period, NFL teams will now select from the latest batch of players to emerge from the college game.They have been scouting the top prospects for months, with fans and media speculating over who will pick who.Now dreams will come true this weekend as 257 players hear their name being called out at this year's NFL Draft.How does the NFL draft work?Published26 April 2024Which team gets the first pick?All 32 teams have one pick in each of the seven rounds - unless they have agreed trades - and they go in the reverse order of last season's standings, so the team with the worst record gets the first pick and the Super Bowl winners go last.Going into the final game of last season, the New England Patriots were set for the first pick of the 2025 draft, but victory over a weakened Buffalo means they now have the fourth pick.That left three teams on three wins from the 2024 season so the draft order was determined by the strength of their schedule - the record of their opponents.The Tennessee Titans were therefore given the first pick, while the Cleveland Browns will choose second and the New York Giants third.Will Levis has failed to establish himself as Tennessee's starting quarterback and last season's back-up Mason Rudolph rejoined Pittsburgh in free agency, so the Titans are expected to go for a QB.Which player will be the first pick?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, After impressing the Titans at his pro day, potential first overall pick Cam Ward said \"I told them I was solidifying it today\"There were a record six quarterbacks taken in the first 12 picks of last year's draft but a repeat is very unlikely.Only two quarterbacks are among the highest-rated prospects in this year's draft class, namely Shedeur Sanders and Cam Ward.Sanders was the initial favourite to be the first overall draft pick but was replaced by Ward in January, after he led Miami to a 10-3 season.The 22-year-old racked up the most touchdown passes in college football (39) and the second-most passing yards (4,313) as he wrapped up a five-year college career, which included two-year stints with Incarnate Word and Washington State.Ward, who is 6ft 2in, is now the clear favourite although Sanders could soon follow as the Giants also need a quarterback.Who are the players to watch out for?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Abdul Carter claimed 12 sacks and a total of 68 tackles in 16 games last seasonShedeur Sanders is the youngest son of former NFL star Deion Sanders, who was his head coach throughout his college career, which included two years at Jackson State followed by two at Colorado.The 23-year-old's pass completion rate of 74.0% was the best in college football and helped Colorado to a 9-4 record.Yet Ward and Oregon's Dillon Gabriel were the two quarterbacks among the four Heisman Trophy finalists, for the best college player, which was won by Sanders' team-mate Travis Hunter.The 21-year-old has been dubbed a 'unicorn' as he is a genuine two-way player - he plays significant time on both defence and offence, as a cornerback and wide receiver.The last player to do that in the NFL was Deion Sanders in the 1990s, which is partly why Hunter played under him at Jackson State and Colorado, but NFL teams seem unsure how best to utilise him at the top level.Hunter edged out Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty to win the Heisman while Penn State pass rusher Abdul Carter is the top-rated defensive player.Mason Graham (defensive tackle), Jalon Walker (linebacker) and offensive linemen Will Campbell and Armand Membou are also expected to be early picks, while Jalen Milroe and Jaxson Dart are seen as the next best quarterbacks.The Draft 'unicorn' that NFL teams just can't figure outPublished3 MarchWhen and where is the NFL Draft taking place?For the first time the NFL Draft will be held in Green Bay, Wisconsin, home to the league's most successful franchise.The Green Bay Packers have won the most championships (13) during the NFL's 105-year history and the city became known as 'Titletown' during the 1960s.This year's draft events will be staged in and around the Packers' iconic Lambeau Field and the mixed-use development next to the stadium, which is called Titletown.Green Bay is the smallest market in the NFL but 240,000 fans are expected to attend the draft this weekend - more than double the city's population.

Girl fends off love rivals and boy - finally - declares his affection for her.\nIf you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor.\nBut in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention. \nContent creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.\nLatey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette). \nTen women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas. \nThroughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.\nBroadcast on YouTube, Lately is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.\nWinning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".\nOf course, not everyone feels the same way. \n\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.\n\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"\nMr Semere, aged 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.\nSeveral viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"\nAnother asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"\nMs Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.\n\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.\n\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"\nArguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.\nIn one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.\nVivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years. \n\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.\nElsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.\nBy baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.\nMs Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.\n\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.\n\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"\nShe says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\" \nAdapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"\nA second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"\nOff the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.\nThis time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.\n\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.\nAs for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.\n\"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says.\nBut Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\".\nShe is proud that Latey showcased \"the romantic side of Ethiopia\" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media.\n\"It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,\" she says.\n\"It is a new way of seeing.\"\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Two years ago, Dan Somers started to experience a series of strange and unexplained symptoms. He had severe chest pain, was unable to keep food or even water down and kept \"chucking up bile\".\nThough he had a sense that something might be wrong, Dan was reluctant to seek medical help. \"I'm really stubborn when it comes down to going to the doctors,\" the 43-year-old from Ipswich tells the BBC. \"I didn't want to be a burden.\"\nDan's pain continued to get worse, until he was \"near enough screaming on the floor in pain\" and had to take time off work. It was the worst pain he's ever experienced, he says upon reflection.\nBut \"I honestly thought I could try and fix it,\" Dan recalls.\nIt was his wife who finally managed to push Dan to see the doctor.\nHis GP sent him straight to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a gallbladder infection and spent a week recovering. He was told he had been close to getting sepsis.\nDan's story mirrors those of other men who've told the BBC they've also put off seeking medical treatment - often until their symptoms became unbearable or until a loved one pushed them to get help.\nIt's well known that men go to the doctors less than women, and data backs this up.\nThe NHS told the BBC it doesn't release demographic data about GP appointments. But according to the ONS Health Insight Survey from February, commissioned by NHS England, 45.8% of women compared to just 33.5% of men had attempted to make contact with their GP practice for themselves or someone else in their household in the last 28 days.\nMen were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and \"rarely or never\" used a pharmacy, too.\nThey also make up considerably fewer hospital outpatient appointments than women, even when pregnancy-related appointments are discounted.\nMen are \"less likely to attend routine appointments and more likely to delay help-seeking until symptoms interfere with daily function,\" says Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York.\nThis all affects men's health outcomes.\nExperts say there's a long list of reasons why men might put off seeking medical help, and new survey data from the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play.\nIn the survey, 48% of male respondents agreed they felt a degree of pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues, while a third agreed they felt talking about potential health concerns might make others see them as weak. The poll heard from almost 1,000 men in England in November and December 2024.\nSociety associates masculinity with traits like self-reliance, independence and not showing vulnerability, says social psychologist Prof Brendan Gough of Leeds Beckett University. \"Men are traditionally supposed to sort things out themselves\".\n\"It's worrying to see just how many men still feel unable to talk about their health concerns,\" says Dr Claire Fuller, NHS medical director for primary care. She notes that men can be reluctant to seek medical support for mental health and for changes in their bodies that could be signs of cancer.\n\"GPs are often the best way to access the help they need,\" she adds.\nKevin McMullan says he's learned from working for men's mental health charity ManHealth that men want to solve their own problems. He says he struggled with his mental health for years before he finally got help.\n\"You want to fix it yourself. Men are inherent problem-solvers and how you are feeling is a problem in the same way that having a flat tyre is a problem,\" says Kevin, 44, from Sedgefield in County Durham.\nThis is something that the Health Insights Survey indicates, too. The data suggests that when people were unable to contact their GP practice, men were significantly more likely than women to report \"self-managing\" their condition, while women were more likely than men to go to a pharmacy or call 111.\n\"Many men feel that help-seeking threatens their sense of independence or competence,\" Prof Galdas says.\nProf Galdas points to other factors deterring men from going to the doctors, like appointment systems that don't fit around their working patterns.\nServices also rely on talking openly about problems, he suggests, which doesn't reflect how men speak about health concerns - and there are no fixed check-ups targeting younger men.\nWomen, in contrast, are \"sort of forced to engage in the health system\" because they might seek appointments related to menstruation, contraception, cervical screenings or pregnancy, says Seb Pillon, a GP in Bolton.\nAnd they're largely in control of organising their family's healthcare, too. For example, roughly 90% of the people who contacted the children's sleep charity Sleep Action for help in the last six months were mums, grandmothers and other women in the children's lives, its head of service Alyson O'Brien says.\nBecause women are more integrated in the healthcare system - through seeking support for both themselves and their children - they're more health-literate and are often the driving force behind their partners seeking medical help, according to Prof Galdas.\nAnd men just have a different attitude towards healthcare, Dr Pillon says. He believes many see it solely as treatment - solving their problems - rather than preventative. Men are, for example, less likely to take part in the NHS's bowel cancer screening programme. As Prof Galdas says: \"men often seek help when symptoms disrupt their ability to function.\"\nFor Jonathan Anstee, 54, from Surrey, it took his symptoms getting drastically worse for him to book a doctors appointment, after months of stomach aches and blood in his stool.\n\"The pain got a lot worse and the blood got a lot worse,\" Jonathan says. \"But even when I went to the doctors, I was sat in the waiting room thinking 'this is a massive waste of time'.\"\nHe was diagnosed with bowel cancer in September 2022.\nThroughout his life he'd generally avoided doctors appointments, Jonathan says. And as a father, \"you're used to worrying about your kids and not yourself,\" he says. Going to the doctors for himself, not his children, seemed \"a bit sort of indulgent\", he says.\nLast year, Jonathan was told his bowel cancer was stage four.\nHaving blood in his stool had felt too embarrassing to talk to his friends and family about at the time. Jonathan's advice to other men is: \"There is absolutely no need to be embarrassed. The alternative could kill you - literally.\"\nIn recent years, support groups for men with cancer and mental health conditions have sprung up.\nMatthew Wiltshire started the men's charity the Cancer Club after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2015. He died in 2023.\nMatthew felt there wasn't a space \"where men were openly talking about what it's like to go through cancer,\" his son, Oliver Wiltshire, says. \"He also noticed how much of the emotional load was being carried by the women around him.\"\nThrough the Cancer Club, men can message online and attend sports events together.\n\"Whether it's practical advice, honest chat or just knowing someone else gets it, that connection can make a big difference,\" Oliver adds.\nExperts say that while men's attitudes towards healthcare are gradually changing for the better, more work still needs to be done.\nProf Galdas believes men will engage more if services are redesigned to meet their needs - proactively offering support, having flexible access and focusing on practical action to improve mental health issues.\n\"There's good evidence from gender-responsive programmes in mental health, cancer care, and health checks showing this consistently,\" he says.\nFor Dr Pillon, it's adding general health checks for men in their 20s to get them more used to accessing medical care. \nThey're already available through the NHS for people aged 40 to 74, but introducing them for younger men who might not otherwise go to the doctors would \"embed the idea that you can come and use health services\", he says.\nIf you have been affected by some of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.",

the New Zealander has used three different fly-halves across four games.\nUtility back Helena Rowland started the opening-round win over Italy, with Saracens' Zoe Harrison starting the back-to-back victories over Wales and Ireland.\nHolly Aitchison, who was Mitchell's main 10 last year, started her first game at fly-half this campaign in Saturday's win over Scotland.\nHarrison's tactical kicking has been praised by Mitchell, who previously favoured Aitchison's running game.\nBut Aitchison showed improvement in her kicking game on Saturday, summed up by a well-weighted nudge in-behind Scotland's defence during the first half, to show the England coaches that she can also control a game like Harrison.\nSeven out of nine conversions also indicated improvement from the kicking tee - an area the Bristol Bears fly-half struggled with last Six Nations.\n\"Holly has put that [goal-kicking issue] to bed and ticked the box that says 'you can't pick me because I can't do that', which is all you can do as a player,\" former England fly-half Katy Daley-McLean told BBC'S Rugby Union Weekly.\nFrance enjoy an unstructured game, well-suited for attacking rugby, which may mean Mitchell leans towards kicking control at 10.\nNatasha Hunt (left) and Lucy Packer (right)\nThe contest over who will partner the chosen fly-half is also heating up.\nNatasha Hunt has been Mitchell's go-to starting scrum-half during his tenure, but after a slow start against Ireland, when England led only 7-5 at half-time in Cork, replacement scrum-half Lucy Packer helped speed up the game in a much-improved second-half performance that ended 49-5 in England's favour.\nPacker was rewarded with a start against Scotland and again showed her fast service as England scored 42 first-half points.\nHarlequins' Packer impacting the game from the bench, with Hunt's experience from the off, has been the usual play by Mitchell, but he is not shy of a bold selection call.\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nEngland set up Grand Slam decider with France\nAlex Matthews (left), Maddie Feaunati (centre), Marlie Packer (centre) and Sadia Kabeya (right)\nCaptain Zoe Aldcroft has moved from lock to blind-side flanker this campaign and is the only Red Roses player to start every game.\nRegular number eight and 2014 World Cup-winner Alex Matthews was suspended for the opening two games, which opened the door for Maddie Feaunati to pick up the player of the match in the opening round, before scoring two tries in Cardiff.\nAnother powerful display against Scotland by the 22-year-old Exeter Chief means Mitchell now has to decide between form and experience.\nMatthews, 31, picked up player of the match in last year's Grand Slam decider in Bordeaux, and has been Mitchell's reliable big-game player, drawing on her 74 caps of experience.\nFormer England captain Marlie Packer grabbed her 50th England try on Saturday in her 110th cap in a gentle reminder of her importance at open-side flanker.\nDespite losing the captaincy to Aldcroft in January, the 35-year-old featured against Italy and Scotland this campaign and will hope the experience of captaining England to their past two Grand Slams will go in her favour.\nLoughborough Lightning's Sadia Kabeya, 23, shone when wearing the seven shirt in the other two games and has an ability to produce big turnovers, such as the one against Wales on England's tryline, as well as linking play in attack.\nThis video can not be played\nEngland's Packer reacts to victory against Scotland\nJess Breach (left) and Claudia MacDonald (right)\nWhen England won their third Grand Slam in a row last year, their settled back three of Jess Breach, Abby Dow and Ellie Kildunne scored a combined 18 tries.\nWing Breach suffered a long-term hip injury in November, ruling the 27-year-old out until February.\nWhile Dow and Kildunne have continued their scintillating form of last year, with a combined eight tries this championship, Breach, who has looked dangerous on her return, has yet to score this campaign.\nExeter Chiefs' Claudia MacDonald returned to the Red Roses after missing last year's Six Nations following a second neck injury, and backed up her try-scoring return against Italy in round one with two tries and a player-of-the-match performance against Scotland.\nThe 29-year-old, who played in the World Cup final defeat by New Zealand in 2022, has impressed with her high work-rate, sharp footwork and balanced running style.\nGloucester-Hartpury wing Mia Venner saw her fine Premiership Women's Rugby form rewarded in round one, but despite scoring and looking dangerous on the ball, the 22-year-old has not been seen since.\nThe relationship Breach has with Kildunne and Dow may tilt the selection in her favour, but MacDonald is now certainly pushing for inclusion.\nThis video can not be played\nMacDonald grabs her second try against Scotland\n'Fitter and stronger' MacDonald stakes wing spot\nEngland thrash Scotland to set up Grand Slam decider\nWomen's Six Nations: Fixtures, results & BBC coverage\nAsked for her England starters in the jerseys seven to 10 for the game against France, Daley-McLean told Rugby Union Weekly: \"John Mitchell will look at it as a tactical game and not just pick on just form alone.

Aitchison or Harrison?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Holly Aitchison (left) and Zoe Harrison (right)Usually a head coach sticks with his main starting fly-half and builds the rest of the team accordingly.But that has not been the case with Mitchell this Six Nations - the New Zealander has used three different fly-halves across four games.Utility back Helena Rowland started the opening-round win over Italy, with Saracens' Zoe Harrison starting the back-to-back victories over Wales and Ireland.Holly Aitchison, who was Mitchell's main 10 last year, started her first game at fly-half this campaign in Saturday's win over Scotland.Harrison's tactical kicking has been praised by Mitchell, who previously favoured Aitchison's running game.But Aitchison showed improvement in her kicking game on Saturday, summed up by a well-weighted nudge in-behind Scotland's defence during the first half, to show the England coaches that she can also control a game like Harrison.Seven out of nine conversions also indicated improvement from the kicking tee - an area the Bristol Bears fly-half struggled with last Six Nations.\"Holly has put that [goal-kicking issue] to bed and ticked the box that says 'you can't pick me because I can't do that', which is all you can do as a player,\" former England fly-half Katy Daley-McLean told BBC'S Rugby Union Weekly.France enjoy an unstructured game, well-suited for attacking rugby, which may mean Mitchell leans towards kicking control at 10.Scrum-half \u2013 Hunt to hold off Lucy Packer?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Natasha Hunt (left) and Lucy Packer (right)The contest over who will partner the chosen fly-half is also heating up.Natasha Hunt has been Mitchell's go-to starting scrum-half during his tenure, but after a slow start against Ireland, when England led only 7-5 at half-time in Cork, replacement scrum-half Lucy Packer helped speed up the game in a much-improved second-half performance that ended 49-5 in England's favour.Packer was rewarded with a start against Scotland and again showed her fast service as England scored 42 first-half points.Harlequins' Packer impacting the game from the bench, with Hunt's experience from the off, has been the usual play by Mitchell, but he is not shy of a bold selection call.Listen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateEngland set up Grand Slam decider with FranceBack row - experience or in-form youth Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Alex Matthews (left), Maddie Feaunati (centre), Marlie Packer (centre) and Sadia Kabeya (right)Captain Zoe Aldcroft has moved from lock to blind-side flanker this campaign and is the only Red Roses player to start every game.Regular number eight and 2014 World Cup-winner Alex Matthews was suspended for the opening two games, which opened the door for Maddie Feaunati to pick up the player of the match in the opening round, before scoring two tries in Cardiff.Another powerful display against Scotland by the 22-year-old Exeter Chief means Mitchell now has to decide between form and experience.Matthews, 31, picked up player of the match in last year's Grand Slam decider in Bordeaux, and has been Mitchell's reliable big-game player, drawing on her 74 caps of experience.Former England captain Marlie Packer grabbed her 50th England try on Saturday in her 110th cap in a gentle reminder of her importance at open-side flanker.Despite losing the captaincy to Aldcroft in January, the 35-year-old featured against Italy and Scotland this campaign and will hope the experience of captaining England to their past two Grand Slams will go in her favour.Loughborough Lightning's Sadia Kabeya, 23, shone when wearing the seven shirt in the other two games and has an ability to produce big turnovers, such as the one against Wales on England's tryline, as well as linking play in attack.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, England's Packer reacts to victory against ScotlandWing -

        "article_text": "Leicester have been relegated from the Premier League after defeat to Liverpool \nThe banner flown over the King Power Stadium made its point. \n'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool.\nA second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwards as Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winner put the visitors within three points of the Premier League title.\nIt has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. \nThe drop had been coming - Leicester have won just once since December - and there was an air of resignation around the ground, even before Alexander-Arnold's strike. \nThere are unhappy and disconnected fans, players accused of giving up, and a manager in Ruud van Nistelrooy who, despite his pedigree as a player, has seen the Foxes get worse on his watch. \nThere were some boos at full-time, but the majority of home fans had already left. Those who stayed offered a smattering of applause, yet it was an empty gesture.\nIt reflected a club in need of a rebuild but how, and with who, are the biggest questions as Leicester - champions of England nine years ago - face one of their biggest crossroads.\nLeicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold moves Liverpool closer to title\n'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\n'My responsibility to lead the club in the best way' - Nistelrooy\nWhen the Foxes sacked Steve Cooper in October they were 16th, although the cracks were there.\nThe teething problems in moving away from Enzo Maresca's style - less expansive and working the ball quicker - were just part of the issue. \nThe departed Maresca, who led them to the Championship title last season before joining Chelsea, was well-liked by the squad and Cooper struggled to connect with players, even if some of the senior members of the squad - including Jamie Vardy - were onside. \nThere was growing concern from the club that any disconnect would impact their survival prospects, and one of the reasons why they dismissed Cooper. \nSo, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.\nFormer Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.\nYet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.\nThey have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.\nThe Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. \nThat is in stark contrast to the lack of goals under Van Nistelrooy - a revered striker for Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Netherlands - and they have scored just six times in the league since the draw with Brighton on 8 December.\nAnother goalless outing against Liverpool extended the home goal drought to nine league games and 810 minutes - the worst in top-flight history.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"They have some big decisions to make. It has been awful for them. They have been miles off it.\"\nSome players have recently raised concerns over the standard and intensity of training with the drop-off being connected to Leicester's impending relegation, which was becoming increasingly inevitable.\nThe fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks - Van Nistelrooy has dropped him for the last four games for refusing to agree to stay at the training ground one night a week - emphasises the growing tensions. \nWhen asked about whether he had been able to improve the standards and culture in his five months at the club, Van Nistelrooy was clear.\n\"When you don't combine them with results it's always hard. There's no negotiation on these standards and I hold everyone accountable on those,\" the Dutchman said this month. \n\"I know how I worked from a village of 5,000 people in the middle of nowhere to Manchester United and Real Madrid. I know what is necessary to stay at the highest level and I know there are so many people working at this football club who have the quality to do so. But not enough yet. \n\"In difficult moments you get to know people and characters very well. I speak about standards and what is needed to perform at the highest level and that's a culture which needs to be created in this club.\"\nDefender Conor Coady has been one trying to raise spirits at the club's Seagrave training base, but it has been an almost impossible task with results - and he admitted Leicester have not been good enough. \n\"We've took a bit of stick and we'll continue to take stick because it's deserved,\" said the former England centre-back. \"From minute one this season, we haven't been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it'll chew you up and spit you out.\"\nSusan Whelan, Jon Rudkin and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha watched Leicester's defeat to Liverpool\nAs the plane's banner suggested, director of football Jon Rudkin and the board have been the target for fans this season.\nThey see Rudkin as a root cause of their decline in recent seasons. He was, of course, in the same position when the Foxes stunned the world to win the Premier League in 2016, but supporters have made up their minds. \nIt does not help that the hierarchy rarely speak publicly, allowing supporters to understand and digest the situation.\nChief executive Susan Whelan twice met with the Foxes Trust and the club's Fan Advisory Board in February for candid and constructive meetings but the wider fanbase remain disconnected.\nDoes chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha decide to make a change at the top, does head of recruitment Martyn Glover's position come under more scrutiny following a number of poor transfer windows, regardless of financial constraints?\nVan Nistelrooy's position remains a doubt and it is hard to see a long-term future in the wake of damning statistics. \nDefeat against Liverpool leaves him with the unenviable record of having lost 17 of his 22 games, winning just three. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?\nVan Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.\n\"It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there.\n\"The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it. In a situation like this you have to sit very carefully with the club to discuss the matters.\"\nYet sacking a second manager of the season has financial consequences and with money tight, it will be a consideration. Can Leicester financially afford to sack Van Nistelrooy but, going forward, can they afford not to?\nThere is also an acceptance the squad needs a reset but only three players are out of contract - goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, and 38-year-old captain Jamie Vardy. \nWhat happens with Vardy - influential at the club as their last remaining title winner and the scorer of 198 goals - remains open, but it's the biggest decision the club has to make in terms of the squad given his reputation and achievements.\nIt means Leicester must shift big earners to make wholesale changes to a squad which has, in the main, brought them down twice.\nWilfred Ndidi signed a new three-year contract last summer but his appetite for another Championship campaign is likely to have waned and the same will go for defenders Ricardo Pereira and Wout Faes. Although, as part of Leicester's decline, they must find takers.\nGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been a rare bright spot and will have his admirers, as will Bilal El Khannouss, despite an underwhelming first season in England, while Winks' situation could depend on Van Nistelrooy's exit. \nLike every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.\nLeicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.\nYet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float.  \nFor now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with.\nThey made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. This time their short-term future is far less certain.",

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

These were 10-year-olds,\" one teacher said.\nAnother teacher said: \"In a secondary English class last year, a group of boys opted, despite discouragement, to write a persuasive essay on why Andrew Tate is the GOAT (greatest of all time) which included praise of his view that women are a man's property... all of the parents were contacted and were appalled.\"\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2023, when pushed on whether his controversial views on women harmed young people, Tate claimed he was a \"force for good\". \nPatrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said \"there is an urgent need for concerted action involving schools, colleges and other agencies to safeguard all children and young people from the dangerous influence of far-right populists and extremists\".\n\"Teachers cannot be left alone to deal with these problems,\" he added.\nBut the founder of a group which trains professionals in how to work with boys and young men said the access young people have to pornography is \"way more impactful\" than the influence of people like Tate.\nMichael Conroy, who launched Men at Work in 2019, told BBC Breakfast: \"Without porn, Andrew Tate would not be a known name.\n\"Our boys, sadly, are learning about sex through porn, and it is usually representing to them a difference of power between men and women. \n\"That chimes when they see work from people like Andrew Tate. It's already been learned, in that sense.\"\nMr Conroy said this is often the case for boys aged \"eight, nine upwards\", adding: \"Where there's access to a phone, there's access [to pornography], unfortunately.\"\nHe said while issues like misogyny and sexism were not new in schools, they were being \"turbocharged because of accessibility\" to dangerous material online.\nThe NASUWT conference came after Adolescence, a Netflix drama about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl from his class, prompted a national conversation about online safety.\nLast month, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer welcomed a move by Netflix to make the series available to screen for free in secondary schools.\nBut he said there was no \"simple solution\" to stop boys from being dragged into a \"whirlpool\" of misogyny.\nA DfE spokesperson, responding to the NASUWT poll, said the government provides a range of resources to support teachers and its curriculum review will look at the skills children need to thrive in an online world. \nThe Liberal Democrats said the results were \"shocking, but should come as no surprise\" and that it showed the need to \"cut addictive algorithms off at their source\".\nThe party is calling for a task force to be set up and for money from fines for breaching the Online Safety Act to be reinvested into a safer screens programme in schools.\nEarlier this month, a survey commissioned by BBC News showed more than a third of secondary teachers have reported misogynistic behaviour from pupils at their school in the last week.\nAbout 40% of the teachers who responded also said they felt ill-equipped to handle such conduct.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nCeltic hit five past St Johnstone to cruise into Scottish Cup final\nNearly two years ago, when Brendan Rodgers was mulling over a return to the role of Celtic manager, he caught up with captain Callum McGregor.\nDuring Rodgers first spell at the helm, the midfielder was learning from the armband-wearing Scott Brown while continually nudging his level up a notch. \nAll the ingredients were there when Rodgers left, but when he returned, the McGregor masterpiece was fully made and the pair, who previously enjoyed so much success together, vowed to make more. \nWith three trophies in the cabinet since the Northern Irishman came back, another Premiership title edging ever closer, and a Scottish Cup final against Aberdeen to come, the indomitable duo of Rodgers and McGregor are sticking to their word.\n\"We were talking about trying to win as many trophies as we can, be as dominant as we can, keep pushing the club,\" McGregor said of that chat with Rodgers after opening the scoring in Sunday's thumping cup semi-final win over St Johnstone.\n\"He's a manager that's done so much for my career and put so much trust and faith in me, so, every time I go on the pitch I try and repay that for him. \n\"The best way to do that is by winning trophies.\"\nCeltic thrash St Johnstone to reach Scottish Cup final\nCeltic's Scottish Cup dominance in numbers\nMore Celtic reaction, analysis & fan views\nWith 23 trophies in 11 years, former Scotland international McGregor knows a thing or two about doing just that. He's a serial winner. \nLevel on accolades with Lisbon Lions captain Billy McNeill, only Bobby Lennox and current team-mate James Forrest are ahead of him on the roll of honour.\nShould Celtic seal the Premiership title - they can do so on Saturday against Dundee United - Forrest will move ahead, on his own, as the most decorated Celt. \nRather than focus on his own player of the match performance, he was keen to heap praise on his long-time pal who has \"dedicated his life\" to the club. \nMcGregor, 31, is at the stage where reaching, and winning, finals is \"normal\".\nThe Celtic captain will now prepare for a 15th domestic cup final. He's never lost any of the previous 14. It's a winning feeling that he craves.\n\"If you ask any football player, success is addictive,\" he added. \"It becomes a habit. You just keep wanting more and that's what we're trying to instil in the team. \n\"When we get to these moments, they become normal. You have to win, you have to play well. \n\"So, as much as we can normalise that and keep being successful then hopefully that will keep the group in a good place.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWholesome moment as Jota celebrates with young fan\nNo matter Celtic's dominance in the last decade-plus, it's still frankly outrageous that winning has become so commonplace.\nBut such has been the way of it under Rodgers. The Northern Irishman is on the cusp of his own slice of history, as the first Celtic manager to oversee three trebles.\nHis first was secured in the most dramatic of fashions against Aberdeen in 2017, with Tom Rogic's extra-time goal clinching the Scottish Cup.\nSince then, what used to be a rare achievement has become a yearly target for Celtic, Rodgers and \"the glue\" to it all, McGregor.\nEven from afar, the understanding the pair have is evident. The manager fleetingly singles players out, but he's never shy to do so with his captain. \n\"He is such a unique player, the tempo setter for the team,\" Rodgers told BBC Scotland after the St Johnstone game. \"He's tactically so good, he really is a coach on the pitch. \n\"He sees all the pictures we want and he knows when to release himself to shoot or create goals. A wonderful player who is the glue for this team.\"\nWhen McGregor is missing - rare as that is - it's undeniably noticeable. See the defeat by Rangers last month for a recent example. \nBut with him, Celtic are a different animal.",

        "article_text": "The Everglades' eclectic alligators are surprisingly diverse builders, bodyguards, commuters, and health-bringing engineers.\nFrom the edge of the Miccosukee Indian Reservation, in the north of the Florida Everglades, it is a short fan-boat ride through grassy swamp to get to an island that 18-year-old Hector Tigertail's family visit each year. For decades, this family \"hammock\" \u2013 as the tree-covered islands that poke out from the Everglades are known \u2013 has been their retreat; a place where the family can camp, cook and hunt. But they share this particular island with at least one permanent resident: an American alligator that, at around 7ft (2.1m) from nose to tail, is the largest female he's ever seen.\u00a0\nTigertail's family, members of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and this powerful reptile, which locals refer to as Mama Gator, have lived side by side for much of the 60-year-old animal's life, he explains. This intimate coexistence provides a chance to observe how alligators meticulously shape their surroundings. Through the dry season between December and May, she excavates a \"gator pond\" with her snout, claws and tail, a depression where water pools and she can wallow, keep cool and mate. At the start of the rainy season (from June to November), she builds a raised nest for her clutch of eggs, from mud, grass and twigs \u2013 a time when the humans know to keep a respectful distance from the protective mother. In return, for the next few years, they are often rewarded with the sight of Mama and her baby gators in tow.\u00a0\n\"We like to call her Mama Gator because she's everybody's grandma,\" says Tigertail.\nIn recent years, scientific research is adding support to something Florida's Miccosukee Tribe have long known: alligators like Mama play vital roles as \"guardians of the Everglades\" and engineer their environment in ways that protect freshwater ecosystems. Alligators carry around nutrients that feed ecosystem webs, and their ponds and nests provide refuges where plants, fish\u00a0and frogs live. New data hints that that alligators may also benefit us.\n\"Apex predator or not, alligators are actually very helpful and they can change the ecosystem significantly,\" says Tigertail, who researches alligators for the Miccosukee Tribe's Fish and Wildlife Department. \"During the dry season, a lot of animals \u2013\u00a0 deer, fish, otters, turtles, birds \u2013\u00a0 follow the alligators.\"\nFor those like biologist Christopher Murray who has spent decades closely studying alligators, it's high time to move past their reputation as cold-hearted killers and recognise the varied roles they're playing as caring and constructive ecosystem engineers. While the cute, herbivorous beaver is widely celebrated for stewarding temperate wetlands, it is the \"gnarly swamp monsters\" who deserve plaudits in the southeastern United States and many other places, says Murray, associate professor at Southeastern Louisiana University. \"I think we're just beginning to understand that crocodilians, in general, and specifically alligators, do a lot more good than we think.\"\u00a0\nAlligators are often called \"living fossils\", relatively untouched by major evolutionary changes for at least eight million years, with remarkably similar ancestors already hunting swamps alongside the dinosaurs. Yet, beginning in the 1850s, the arrival of rifle-wielding European settlers into the wetlands of Florida and Louisiana drove this evolutionary line to the verge of extinction.\u00a0\nMore than 10 million alligators were killed by commercial hunting up to the 1960s, driven by the popularity of their hides for bags, belts and boots, with others shot for sport or \"just for fun\" according to historical accounts. In 1967, American alligators were placed on endangered species lists, leading to nationwide hunting bans that allowed populations to recover. Today, the species is recognised as a standout conservation success story, as the population has rebounded to more than three million alligators estimated to live in the wild in the states of Florida and Louisiana, and thousands more spread across the south-eastern United States.\nJust as conservationists began fighting to save the species from extinction in the 1960s and 1970s, researchers began documenting their important ecological roles. In the wet season, the raised ridges around the edge of these nests are relatively dry land where some plants can escape flooding and provide platforms where smaller reptiles build their own nests. Meanwhile wading birds build their own nests above alligators, which act as \"bodyguards\", keeping raccoons and other predators away from the birds' eggs. (More recent research has shown that this is a macabre but overall mutually beneficial arrangement with alligators being rewarded with snacks from chicks that fall from the nests.)\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nMike Heithaus, professor of biological sciences at Florida International University, explains that, despite its lush appearances, the Everglades can be a nutrient poor environment. A largely flat wetland, dominated by grass-like plants, many key nutrients are carried out to sea by great slow-flowing seasonal rivers, some kilometres wide.\u00a0\nIn the dry season, when the water level falls, research since the mid-20th Century has shown that alligators' habit of excavating holes created variety in the otherwise monotonous landscape, with unique communities of plants, animals and algae around ponds. These holes can be architecturally diverse \u2013 created by one alligator or up to a dozen together \u2013 incorporating eclectic \"burrows and hidey-holes\", says Heithaus, including underwater caverns, where the alligator can stay submerged for hours. These aquatic environments form refuges in which fish like juvenile largemouth bass survive the dry season but can also be \"death traps\" which lure birds in search of a snack, he adds.\u00a0\nWe're now learning these are surprisingly dynamic systems. Research in 2023 showed that it was not only the construction of the ponds that counted \"but actively being in the pond matters\", says Heithaus. As the alligators move, they continually stir up the sediment to keep those nutrients in the water. \"The alligators are moving around; they're pooping in there. That's providing nutrients which algae \u2013 that form the base of the food web \u2013 rely on. So, you kind of prime the pump: you feed the bottom of the food chain and [the nutrients] come all the way up.\"\u00a0\nWithout alligators, there would be much less nutrients circulated in the water, says Heithaus. \"You put alligators there, and you get food and water, and that's happy times for most critters in the Everglades.\"\nThis research also reveals a lesser-seen side of alligators, spotlighting them as remarkably sophisticated and adaptable creatures. The alligator's reputation as a \"man-eating monster\" was inspired long ago by accounts like William Bartram's widely reproduced (and wildly inaccurate) stories of encountering alligators in Florida swamps with \"clouds of smoke\" erupting from their nostrils. Although attacks on humans are very rare, these cold-blooded animals remain feared by many as killers or \"weird swamp things\", says Murray, who has worked with alligators for more than two decades.\nThose who live up close with alligators see other qualities. One alligator in the state of Georgia, named Wally, was even docile enough to be domesticated as an \"emotional support alligator\", providing comfort and \"hugs\" to help alleviate his owner's depression.\u00a0\nDespite the reported gentleness of some individuals, it is recommended to stay at least 9m (30ft) away from alligators in the wild. Alligators are carnivores, powerful enough to bring down a wild deer or feral boar but \"naturally they're going to be more of a flighty, non-confrontational animal,\" says Kendall Osceola, who worked at the Miccosukee Indian Village, the tribe's cultural centre. The Miccosukee learn a strict set of rules from a young age for sharing their coastal homes with gators. \"We were always told if there's a body of water in Florida, there's going to be an alligator in there. So, keep a careful eye on any pets or anything small around the water line,\" she says. Yet Miccosukee stories depict them as \"benevolent creatures\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\n\u2022\u00a0How do you re-home a rhino? Upside down\n\u2022\u00a0Elephants hate bees - here's how that helps humans\n\u2022\u00a0A wild\u00a0'freakosystem' has been born in Hawaii\nToday, alligators have adapted to live in the urbanised environments of golf courses, canals and sewers. Researchers have been surprised by how varied and flexible alligators are, explains Heithaus, yet research in 2011 found behaviours that have shocked even those who study them. Near Miccosukee village, in an area where alligators live in mangrove forests alongside a fast-flowing river, Heithaus and Adam Rosenblatt fitted trackers to alligators, finding that similar alligators lived very different lives \u2013 some were \"couch potatoes\" who remain close to home, while others were \"commuters\" who travel long distances to coastal areas. \"Tag two alligators \u2013 same size, both males, 20m (65.6ft) apart on the shore \u2013 and one will not move more than 7km (4.3 miles) in total in three months, and the other might do 800km (497 miles),\" says Heithaus.\nWhile American alligators have been spotted swimming out in the ocean in the past, prior to this research this behaviour was believed to be extremely rare, says Heithaus. Unlike crocodiles, alligators lack specialised glands to process salt, yet this monitoring showed that some alligators frequently venture out into the ocean when there are abundant saltwater fish and crabs to feast on. \"When we first got some data suggesting the alligators were down in these saltwater environments for maybe 18 hours at a time, we were looked at like we had two heads \u2013 people didn't believe it at all,\" says Heithaus. \"And I think it's one of the cool things we're finding across sharks, alligators, and lots of animals \u2013 that there's a lot more behavioural adaptability and individual specialisation than we would have thought \u2013 bold individuals, shy individuals; exploratory individuals, stay-at-home individuals.\"\nHeithaus is aiming to figure out what causes these different behaviours \u2013 whether genetic or influenced by environmental factors \u2013 as well as what role \"commuting\" plays in cycling nutrients around wetland environments. Already, studies have shown that alligator ponds are richer in key nutrients like phosphorus and commuters are carrying nutrients up into the wetlands from coastal areas, by eating in the oceans and excreting upstream. \"We know that they're moving these nutrients upstream,\" says Heithaus. His team at the Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research Program is seeking a more granular understanding of how this affects the overall \"nutrient budget\" of the ecosystem, where nutrients are deposited, and how it affects the overall system.\nCrucially, at a time when the Gulf Coast is being hard hit by the impacts of climate change, we are also learning that alligators may affect their environments' ability to capture carbon. By analysing soil samples across Louisiana, Murray was recently able to demonstrate in a study that areas with high numbers of alligators are rich carbon stores. \"What this paper says to me is: look, we rescued the American alligator from extinction,\" he says, \"but what we didn't realise, back then, was that maybe we were actually doing a lot more for the environment \u2013 in the context of carbon sequestration and the battle against climate change \u2013 than we previously thought.\"\nThe next step, says Murray, is to show that alligators are actively contributing to higher carbon storage in these areas \u2013 and how. We have good reason to think alligators, as apex predators, may be playing a similar \"top-down\" role to the famed wolves of Yellowstone, whose return has reduced herbivore grazing on small trees and helped forests to regrow. The theory of trophic cascades developed by Utah State University ecologist Trisha Atwood has shown that apex predators are not only vital for ecosystem health but could have big impacts on CO2 dynamics. This could be particularly important in freshwater ecosystems like Louisiana's tidally inundated wetlands, which store enormous amounts of carbon, says Murray, but can turn into a carbon source when they dry out.\nMurray hopes his forthcoming research can provide further evidence about the value of supporting healthy alligator populations. Although hunting bans were the most important step to save the species from extinction, efforts to protect and restore populations are ongoing and involve groups who are often less recognised, he says. Among them are commercial alligator ranchers who retrieve eggs from the wild, incubate them and raise them through the first few years of life in enclosed or semi-wild environments, safeguarding them when they are most vulnerable to predation and disease. This form of early-years care, known as \"head-starting\", is common in conservation initiatives that aim to help endangered animals \u2013 from Eastern indigo snakes to burrowing owls. But, in Louisiana, this is a \"self-funded\" system driven by ranchers, says Murray. These ranchers are required to release 5% of alligators they raise into the wild, while the rest are treated as livestock that can be butchered for meat and hides.\u00a0\nIn the Everglades, head-starting is also carried out by the Miccosukee, who rescue eggs in years when water levels in the Everglades rise, threatening to drown eggs, or temperatures fall to levels that can harm baby alligators. \"Sometimes I would be at home and my uncle would tell me: 'Hey, the temperature is dropping really fast. It's going to be a really cold night. So get on the airboat and we have to go out there before the cold weather kills them',\" says Tigertail.\nDespite their fearsome reputation, all this hints at a future where humans and alligators coexist, with these reptiles recognised as \"helpful participants\" in solutions to the challenges we both face, says Murray. \"If you think historically, alligators and other crocodilians have been revered as a sacred entity in cultures around the world. Do they command respect? Yes. But are they monsters? Are they to be feared? No.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "A team of scientists claim to have discovered a new colour that no human has ever seen before. \nThe research follows an experiment in which researchers in the US had laser pulses fired into their eyes. \nBy stimulating specific cells in the retina, the participants claim to have witnessed a blue-green colour that scientists have called \"olo\", but some experts have said the existence of a new colour is \"open to argument\". \nThe findings, published in the journal Science Advances on Friday, have been described by the study's co-author, Prof Ren Ng from the University of California, as \"remarkable\". \nHe and his colleagues believe that the results could potentially further research into colour blindness. \nProf Ng, who was one of five people to take part in the experiment, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday that olo was \"more saturated than any colour that you can see in the real world\". \n\"Let's say you go around your whole life and you see only pink, baby pink, a pastel pink,\" he said. \n\"And then one day you go to the office and someone's wearing a shirt, and it's the most intense baby pink you've ever seen, and they say it's a new colour and we call it red.\"\nDuring the team's experiment, researchers shone a laser beam into the pupil of one eye of each participant. \nThere were five participants in the study - four male and one female - who all had normal colour vision. Three of the participants - including Prof Ng - were co-authors of the research paper.\nAccording to the research paper, the participants looked into a device called Oz which consists of mirrors, lasers and optical devices. The equipment was designed previously by some of the involved researchers - a team of scientists from UC Berkeley and the University of Washington, and updated for use in this study.\nThe retina is a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye responsible for receiving and processing visual information. It converts light into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve, enabling us to see.\nThe retina includes cone cells, which are cells responsible for perceiving colour. \nThere are three types of cone cells in the eye - S, L and M - and each one is sensitive to different wavelengths of blue, red and green respectively.\nAccording to the research paper, in normal vision, \"any light that stimulates an M cone cell must also stimulate its neighbouring L and/or S cones\", because its function overlaps with them. \nHowever, in the study, the laser only stimulated M cones, \"which in principle would send a colour signal to the brain that never occurs in natural vision\", the paper said. \nThis means the colour olo could not be seen by a person's naked eye in the real world without the help of specific stimulation. \nTo verify the colour observed during the experiment, each participant adjusted a controllable colour dial until it matched olo. \nSome experts, however, say the new perceived colour is a \"matter of interpretation\". \nProf John Barbur, a vision scientist at City St George's, University of London, who was not involved in the study, said that while the research is a \"technological feat\" in stimulating selective cone cells, the discovery of a new colour is \"open to argument\".\nHe explained that if, for example, the red cone cells (L) were stimulated in large numbers, people would \"perceive a deep red\", but the perceived brightness may change depending on changes to red cone sensitivity, which is not unlike what happened in this study.\nBut the study's co-author Prof Ng admitted that although olo is \"certainly very technically difficult\" to see, the team is studying the findings to see what it could potentially mean for colour blind people, who find it difficult to distinguish between certain colours.",

        "article_text": "The Everglades' eclectic alligators are surprisingly diverse builders, bodyguards, commuters, and health-bringing engineers.\nFrom the edge of the Miccosukee Indian Reservation, in the north of the Florida Everglades, it is a short fan-boat ride through grassy swamp to get to an island that 18-year-old Hector Tigertail's family visit each year. For decades, this family \"hammock\" \u2013 as the tree-covered islands that poke out from the Everglades are known \u2013 has been their retreat; a place where the family can camp, cook and hunt. But they share this particular island with at least one permanent resident: an American alligator that, at around 7ft (2.1m) from nose to tail, is the largest female he's ever seen.\u00a0\nTigertail's family, members of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and this powerful reptile, which locals refer to as Mama Gator, have lived side by side for much of the 60-year-old animal's life, he explains. This intimate coexistence provides a chance to observe how alligators meticulously shape their surroundings. Through the dry season between December and May, she excavates a \"gator pond\" with her snout, claws and tail, a depression where water pools and she can wallow, keep cool and mate. At the start of the rainy season (from June to November), she builds a raised nest for her clutch of eggs, from mud, grass and twigs \u2013 a time when the humans know to keep a respectful distance from the protective mother. In return, for the next few years, they are often rewarded with the sight of Mama and her baby gators in tow.\u00a0\n\"We like to call her Mama Gator because she's everybody's grandma,\" says Tigertail.\nIn recent years, scientific research is adding support to something Florida's Miccosukee Tribe have long known: alligators like Mama play vital roles as \"guardians of the Everglades\" and engineer their environment in ways that protect freshwater ecosystems. Alligators carry around nutrients that feed ecosystem webs, and their ponds and nests provide refuges where plants, fish\u00a0and frogs live. New data hints that that alligators may also benefit us.\n\"Apex predator or not, alligators are actually very helpful and they can change the ecosystem significantly,\" says Tigertail, who researches alligators for the Miccosukee Tribe's Fish and Wildlife Department. \"During the dry season, a lot of animals \u2013\u00a0 deer, fish, otters, turtles, birds \u2013\u00a0 follow the alligators.\"\nFor those like biologist Christopher Murray who has spent decades closely studying alligators, it's high time to move past their reputation as cold-hearted killers and recognise the varied roles they're playing as caring and constructive ecosystem engineers. While the cute, herbivorous beaver is widely celebrated for stewarding temperate wetlands, it is the \"gnarly swamp monsters\" who deserve plaudits in the southeastern United States and many other places, says Murray, associate professor at Southeastern Louisiana University. \"I think we're just beginning to understand that crocodilians, in general, and specifically alligators, do a lot more good than we think.\"\u00a0\nAlligators are often called \"living fossils\", relatively untouched by major evolutionary changes for at least eight million years, with remarkably similar ancestors already hunting swamps alongside the dinosaurs. Yet, beginning in the 1850s, the arrival of rifle-wielding European settlers into the wetlands of Florida and Louisiana drove this evolutionary line to the verge of extinction.\u00a0\nMore than 10 million alligators were killed by commercial hunting up to the 1960s, driven by the popularity of their hides for bags, belts and boots, with others shot for sport or \"just for fun\" according to historical accounts. In 1967, American alligators were placed on endangered species lists, leading to nationwide hunting bans that allowed populations to recover. Today, the species is recognised as a standout conservation success story, as the population has rebounded to more than three million alligators estimated to live in the wild in the states of Florida and Louisiana, and thousands more spread across the south-eastern United States.\nJust as conservationists began fighting to save the species from extinction in the 1960s and 1970s, researchers began documenting their important ecological roles. In the wet season, the raised ridges around the edge of these nests are relatively dry land where some plants can escape flooding and provide platforms where smaller reptiles build their own nests. Meanwhile wading birds build their own nests above alligators, which act as \"bodyguards\", keeping raccoons and other predators away from the birds' eggs. (More recent research has shown that this is a macabre but overall mutually beneficial arrangement with alligators being rewarded with snacks from chicks that fall from the nests.)\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nMike Heithaus, professor of biological sciences at Florida International University, explains that, despite its lush appearances, the Everglades can be a nutrient poor environment. A largely flat wetland, dominated by grass-like plants, many key nutrients are carried out to sea by great slow-flowing seasonal rivers, some kilometres wide.\u00a0\nIn the dry season, when the water level falls, research since the mid-20th Century has shown that alligators' habit of excavating holes created variety in the otherwise monotonous landscape, with unique communities of plants, animals and algae around ponds. These holes can be architecturally diverse \u2013 created by one alligator or up to a dozen together \u2013 incorporating eclectic \"burrows and hidey-holes\", says Heithaus, including underwater caverns, where the alligator can stay submerged for hours. These aquatic environments form refuges in which fish like juvenile largemouth bass survive the dry season but can also be \"death traps\" which lure birds in search of a snack, he adds.\u00a0\nWe're now learning these are surprisingly dynamic systems. Research in 2023 showed that it was not only the construction of the ponds that counted \"but actively being in the pond matters\", says Heithaus. As the alligators move, they continually stir up the sediment to keep those nutrients in the water. \"The alligators are moving around; they're pooping in there. That's providing nutrients which algae \u2013 that form the base of the food web \u2013 rely on. So, you kind of prime the pump: you feed the bottom of the food chain and [the nutrients] come all the way up.\"\u00a0\nWithout alligators, there would be much less nutrients circulated in the water, says Heithaus. \"You put alligators there, and you get food and water, and that's happy times for most critters in the Everglades.\"\nThis research also reveals a lesser-seen side of alligators, spotlighting them as remarkably sophisticated and adaptable creatures. The alligator's reputation as a \"man-eating monster\" was inspired long ago by accounts like William Bartram's widely reproduced (and wildly inaccurate) stories of encountering alligators in Florida swamps with \"clouds of smoke\" erupting from their nostrils. Although attacks on humans are very rare, these cold-blooded animals remain feared by many as killers or \"weird swamp things\", says Murray, who has worked with alligators for more than two decades.\nThose who live up close with alligators see other qualities. One alligator in the state of Georgia, named Wally, was even docile enough to be domesticated as an \"emotional support alligator\", providing comfort and \"hugs\" to help alleviate his owner's depression.\u00a0\nDespite the reported gentleness of some individuals, it is recommended to stay at least 9m (30ft) away from alligators in the wild. Alligators are carnivores, powerful enough to bring down a wild deer or feral boar but \"naturally they're going to be more of a flighty, non-confrontational animal,\" says Kendall Osceola, who worked at the Miccosukee Indian Village, the tribe's cultural centre. The Miccosukee learn a strict set of rules from a young age for sharing their coastal homes with gators. \"We were always told if there's a body of water in Florida, there's going to be an alligator in there. So, keep a careful eye on any pets or anything small around the water line,\" she says. Yet Miccosukee stories depict them as \"benevolent creatures\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\n\u2022\u00a0How do you re-home a rhino?

Researchers have been surprised by how varied and flexible alligators are, explains Heithaus, yet research in 2011 found behaviours that have shocked even those who study them. Near Miccosukee village, in an area where alligators live in mangrove forests alongside a fast-flowing river, Heithaus and Adam Rosenblatt fitted trackers to alligators, finding that similar alligators lived very different lives \u2013 some were \"couch potatoes\" who remain close to home, while others were \"commuters\" who travel long distances to coastal areas. \"Tag two alligators \u2013 same size, both males, 20m (65.6ft) apart on the shore \u2013 and one will not move more than 7km (4.3 miles) in total in three months, and the other might do 800km (497 miles),\" says Heithaus.\nWhile American alligators have been spotted swimming out in the ocean in the past, prior to this research this behaviour was believed to be extremely rare, says Heithaus. Unlike crocodiles, alligators lack specialised glands to process salt, yet this monitoring showed that some alligators frequently venture out into the ocean when there are abundant saltwater fish and crabs to feast on. \"When we first got some data suggesting the alligators were down in these saltwater environments for maybe 18 hours at a time, we were looked at like we had two heads \u2013 people didn't believe it at all,\" says Heithaus. \"And I think it's one of the cool things we're finding across sharks, alligators, and lots of animals \u2013 that there's a lot more behavioural adaptability and individual specialisation than we would have thought \u2013 bold individuals, shy individuals; exploratory individuals, stay-at-home individuals.\"\nHeithaus is aiming to figure out what causes these different behaviours \u2013 whether genetic or influenced by environmental factors \u2013 as well as what role \"commuting\" plays in cycling nutrients around wetland environments. Already, studies have shown that alligator ponds are richer in key nutrients like phosphorus and commuters are carrying nutrients up into the wetlands from coastal areas, by eating in the oceans and excreting upstream. \"We know that they're moving these nutrients upstream,\" says Heithaus. His team at the Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research Program is seeking a more granular understanding of how this affects the overall \"nutrient budget\" of the ecosystem, where nutrients are deposited, and how it affects the overall system.\nCrucially, at a time when the Gulf Coast is being hard hit by the impacts of climate change, we are also learning that alligators may affect their environments' ability to capture carbon. By analysing soil samples across Louisiana, Murray was recently able to demonstrate in a study that areas with high numbers of alligators are rich carbon stores. \"What this paper says to me is: look, we rescued the American alligator from extinction,\" he says, \"but what we didn't realise, back then, was that maybe we were actually doing a lot more for the environment \u2013 in the context of carbon sequestration and the battle against climate change \u2013 than we previously thought.\"\nThe next step, says Murray, is to show that alligators are actively contributing to higher carbon storage in these areas \u2013 and how. We have good reason to think alligators, as apex predators, may be playing a similar \"top-down\" role to the famed wolves of Yellowstone, whose return has reduced herbivore grazing on small trees and helped forests to regrow. The theory of trophic cascades developed by Utah State University ecologist Trisha Atwood has shown that apex predators are not only vital for ecosystem health but could have big impacts on CO2 dynamics. This could be particularly important in freshwater ecosystems like Louisiana's tidally inundated wetlands, which store enormous amounts of carbon, says Murray, but can turn into a carbon source when they dry out.\nMurray hopes his forthcoming research can provide further evidence about the value of supporting healthy alligator populations. Although hunting bans were the most important step to save the species from extinction, efforts to protect and restore populations are ongoing and involve groups who are often less recognised, he says. Among them are commercial alligator ranchers who retrieve eggs from the wild, incubate them and raise them through the first few years of life in enclosed or semi-wild environments, safeguarding them when they are most vulnerable to predation and disease. This form of early-years care, known as \"head-starting\", is common in conservation initiatives that aim to help endangered animals \u2013 from Eastern indigo snakes to burrowing owls. But, in Louisiana, this is a \"self-funded\" system driven by ranchers, says Murray. These ranchers are required to release 5% of alligators they raise into the wild, while the rest are treated as livestock that can be butchered for meat and hides.\u00a0\nIn the Everglades, head-starting is also carried out by the Miccosukee, who rescue eggs in years when water levels in the Everglades rise, threatening to drown eggs, or temperatures fall to levels that can harm baby alligators. \"Sometimes I would be at home and my uncle would tell me: 'Hey, the temperature is dropping really fast. It's going to be a really cold night. So get on the airboat and we have to go out there before the cold weather kills them',\" says Tigertail.\nDespite their fearsome reputation, all this hints at a future where humans and alligators coexist, with these reptiles recognised as \"helpful participants\" in solutions to the challenges we both face, says Murray. \"If you think historically, alligators and other crocodilians have been revered as a sacred entity in cultures around the world. Do they command respect? Yes. But are they monsters? Are they to be feared? No.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold planted his shirt on the corner flag after scoring his winner at Leicester\nThe sight of Trent Alexander-Arnold celebrating bare chested with arms outstretched, his red shirt hoisted on a corner flag at King Power Stadium, will become an iconic image of Liverpool's march to the Premier League title.\nAmid the wild elation that followed his late winner at relegated Leicester City, it left Liverpool's big questions still hanging in the air.\nWill Alexander-Arnold leave his home city club behind in pursuit of new glory with Real Madrid in Spain? Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated. And the final part of the script was written when Alexander-Arnold returned as a substitute with 19 minutes left, having been out since early March with an ankle injury.\nPremier League: Leicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold scores Liverpool winner - report & reaction\n'I know why Real appeal to Alexander-Arnold - I was tempted too'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk pushed Alexander-Arnold to take the acclaim of travelling fans after his winner at Leicester City\nIt took him five minutes to release the pressure valve, of sorts, that had been building as the doomed Foxes frustrated Liverpool.\nThe scenes that followed will be tantalising ones for any Liverpool fan who clings to the hope Alexander-Arnold will reject the advances of Real Madrid.\nCould there still be a late twist in Alexander-Arnold's long-running contract situation?\nCould the wild celebrations, and the communion between Alexander-Arnold and those fans in one red-drenched corner of King Power Stadium, make him rethink his next move?\nThere is confidence in Spain that Alexander-Arnold will be at Real Madrid next season - but the leaving of Liverpool will still be tough for a player who grew up in the city's West Derby district.\nHe has faced some criticism for not committing to Liverpool, especially since Salah and Van Dijk signed new contracts, but there was none here. This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing.

Although the Australian was quicker in both the second and third sectors, the Dutchman had done enough to grab pole.\nVerstappen said: \"I definitely didn't expect to be on pole here but the car came alive in the night and it was a lot more enjoyable to drive.

Our pace is good. It's going to be a tough race, the tyres are softer than last year and we'll see if that plays to our advantage.\"\nNorris will have to rely on the strong race pace of the McLaren to try to limit the damage to his championship position, as he starts the race three points clear of Piastri and eight in front of Verstappen.\nHis accident was caused by him misjudging the entry to the chicane at Turns Four and Five. The car oversteered on to the kerb at Five and was flicked into the wall on the exit, damaging the left-hand side of the car.\nHe swore over the radio that he was an \"idiot\", but was unhurt.\n\"Disappointed but I'm fine,\" Norris said. \"The team have a lot of work to do. It has been such a smooth positive weekend so far, so I'm disappointed to have such big setback. But have to take it on the chin, and try and go again tomorrow.\n\"The car is quick. It has been quick all weekend, so I have to work hard to overtake the cars tomorrow.\"\nRussell said he had \"mixed feelings\" because he felt there was more in his car, adding that he rued Mercedes' decision not to use the same strategy as Red Bull after the red flag.\nAt Ferrari, Hamilton's travails this season continued, underlined by the statistic that he has only once so far qualified higher than the seventh place he managed this weekend.\n\"I've been nowhere all weekend,\" Hamilton said. \"I am happier than I was yesterday.

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer.\nThe controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages.\n\"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\"\nWhite House officials have played down reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it.\nTrump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary.\n\"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media,\" he said. \"Try finding something new,\" he said. \nTrump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea  also floated by Hegseth earlier on Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".\nHegseth did not directly respond to reports of a second Signal chat, which were initially covered by the New York Times.\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.\nThe messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times. But it too appeared to share details of military operations against Yemen.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nAlthough the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents. Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices.\nThe second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth criticised the media and denounced the reports. He also said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\".\nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, the top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said the \"Trump-hating media\" was  \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nUS air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.",

But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine.\nSince making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an \"important step\" in those facing addiction.\n\"It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?\" she says.\n\"To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different.\n\"That's why we've shared James's story.\"\nChanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine.\n\"There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs,\" she says.\n\"But it's not just about reclassification [\u2026] it needs to include education, police, health, to really raise awareness. We need a strategy around drug usage and drug deaths in the UK.\"\nThe UK government is currently seeking experts' advice on the re-classification of ketamine, with Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson writing to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) expressing concern over the rise in young people taking the drug.\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"Our thoughts are with James's family and friends, and all those affected by this tragic death, which has sadly reinforced once again the serious dangers of taking ketamine.\n\"We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply.\"\nChanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family \"talked about what we can do\".\n\"The Vivienne left a legacy as a trailblazing icon and this, I feel, is James's legacy. To help other people,\" she says.\n\"If I can help one family to not feel what we are feeling, then it's all worth it.\"\nYou can see the full interview with The Vivienne's sister Chanel on BBC Newsnight at 10:30 on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

Her trademark wit and sincerity are firmly in place, as she talks candidly about social anxiety, crises of confidence, infantilised men, her least favourite sexual positions and being beaten down for speaking up.\nHighlights include The Curse, a stadium-sized ballad about using alcohol as an emotional crutch; and closing track The Deep Blue Okay, where she eventually finds a modicum of inner peace.

If someone's age matches the digits, they die (hence the 33 in the title).\nSomehow, the 30-person team at French developer Sandfall Interactive has also managed to attract some top-tier acting talent to the role-playing game (RPG) project, including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Gollum actor Andy Serkis, Final Fantasy XVI's Ben Starr and Baldur's Gate 3's Jennifer English.\nBut the thing that's arguably generated most excitement is the game's focus on old-school turn-based combat. It was a staple of classic 1990s and early 2000s RPG series such as Final Fantasy that's fallen out of fashion in the blockbuster space of late. If the studio sticks the landing with their debut title, expect to hear about Expedition 33 when Game of the Year season rolls around.\nIf that doesn't take your fancy, video game adaptation Until Dawn is out in cinemas on Friday.

        "article_text": "Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold planted his shirt on the corner flag after scoring his winner at Leicester\nThe sight of Trent Alexander-Arnold celebrating bare chested with arms outstretched, his red shirt hoisted on a corner flag at King Power Stadium, will become an iconic image of Liverpool's march to the Premier League title.\nAmid the wild elation that followed his late winner at relegated Leicester City, it left Liverpool's big questions still hanging in the air.\nWill Alexander-Arnold leave his home city club behind in pursuit of new glory with Real Madrid in Spain? Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated. And the final part of the script was written when Alexander-Arnold returned as a substitute with 19 minutes left, having been out since early March with an ankle injury.\nPremier League: Leicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold scores Liverpool winner - report & reaction\n'I know why Real appeal to Alexander-Arnold - I was tempted too'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\nSuperstar Trent Alexander Arnold's 'unbelievable' left foot half-volley\nIt took him five minutes to release the pressure valve, of sorts, that had been building as the doomed Foxes frustrated Liverpool.\nThe scenes that followed will be tantalising ones for any Liverpool fan who clings to the hope Alexander-Arnold will reject the advances of Real Madrid.\nCould there still be a late twist in Alexander-Arnold's long-running contract situation?\nCould the wild celebrations, and the communion between Alexander-Arnold and those fans in one red-drenched corner of King Power Stadium, make him rethink his next move?\nThere is confidence in Spain that Alexander-Arnold will be at Real Madrid next season - but the leaving of Liverpool will still be tough for a player who grew up in the city's West Derby district.\nHe has faced some criticism for not committing to Liverpool, especially since Salah and Van Dijk signed new contracts, but there was none here. This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "It may be set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but Tony Gilroy's Star Wars series takes a key plot from a real robbery masterminded by Stalin in an Imperial Russian city. And Andor has as much to do with our world as it has with Stalin's.\nIt has all the makings of the perfect heist.\nThe scheme takes place far from the imperial seat of power, on the wild fringes of an empire almost too vast to comprehend. Fuelled with revolutionary zeal, the plotters are a rag-tag outfit of men and women that includes thieves, murderers and turncoats. Their prize? A treasure chest of cash that can fund ever-more-ambitious missions against the hated ruling elite.\nIf you watched the first season of the Star Wars spin-off TV series Andor, you'll recognise this plot as one of the high points. Over three episodes, anti-hero Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and his band of accomplices hide out in mountain passes on the planet Aldhani, fine-tuning an audacious smash-and-grab from an Imperial garrison which is storing the wages of an entire sector.\u00a0\nThe real-life theft that inspired it was also a long, long time ago, just not quite so far away.\nIt took place in Yerevan Square in what was then the imperial Russian city of Tiflis, now the Georgian capital Tblisi, on 26 June 1907. A shipment of cash for the city's Russian state bank branch, amounting to some 300,000 roubles ($1m at the time), was stolen by a gang of robbers linked to the Bolshevik revolutionary movement. Using bombs and guns, the gang left a scene of utter devastation in their wake; some 40 people were killed and dozens more injured. The news of the brazen daylight attack made headlines across the world.\nThe heist was the brainchild of a charismatic cobbler's son-turned-revolutionary called Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili. He was a gifted public speaker, an ex-seminary student, a romantic poet rumoured to have left a string of broken hearts in his rakish wake. He often went by the name \"Soso\" (which he had used when writing poems for local publications), though in years to come he would become far better-known \u2013 and feared \u2013 as Joseph Stalin.\u00a0\nYes, the troubled outlaw beloved by Star Wars fans everywhere is based in part on one of history\u2019s most notorious mass murderers, as the series' creator, Tony Gilroy, has acknowledged. \"If you look at a picture of young Stalin, isn\u2019t he glamorous,\" Gilroy said in an interview in\u00a0Rolling Stone in 2022. \"He looks like Diego!\"\nStalin took Russia from its war-ravaged imperial decline to a nuclear-armed superpower in just three decades, but also presided over a reign of authoritarian terror that starved, executed or imprisoned millions of its own citizens. Countless books had been written on his cruel years in power, but very little on his early years. Writer Simon Sebag Montefiore saw a gap, and began rifling through archives in post-Soviet countries to try and separate the truth from myth, and tell the little-known story of Stalin's early life.\nIn 2007 \u2013 a century after the infamous heist in Tiflis \u2013 Young Stalin was published. It delved into the early life of the Soviet Union's dictatorial leader. \"Should the life of a black-hearted ogre, a mass murderer who was the wickedest of the 20th-Century's monsters, be quite so entertaining,\" asked a review in The Observer at the time.\nOne person who read Young Stalin was Gilroy. The writer and producer, who had scripted the first four Bourne films and the Andor-precursor film, Rogue One, was planning a TV series that would explore Cassian Andor's journey from casual thief to rebellious figurehead. The true story of a revolutionary movement on the far fringes of a real empire gave Gilroy his source material. \"Literally, I\u2019m the classic old white guy who just can\u2019t get enough history,\" Gilroy said in Rolling Stone. \"The last 15 years, I\u2019ve been reading all non-fiction.\" He added that Young Stalin was \"an amazing book\" and that its account of the Tiflis bank robbery was an \"incredible movie sequence\".\nDid Sebag Montefiore ever think to himself, 'Here's the perfect setting for a Star Wars spin-off,' when he was researching his book? \"No, I didn't ever think that when I was toiling in the archives in Moscow and Tbilisi,\" he tells the BBC. \"But I did think that there was something pretty elemental about the life of Stalin, especially before 1917. It was a fascinating story, partly because no one knew about it.\"\nThe Tiflis heist was reported around the world and funded the revolutionaries' movement for years, says Sebag Montefiore. \"Lenin and the whole Bolshevik Party lived off that money until the [1917] revolution.\"\nSebag Montefiore says that the young Stalin and the troubled Andor bear striking similarities: \"A young man from nowhere with a revolutionary ideology, and a fight against a huge empire,\" the writer says. \"I did think there was something interesting about the secret life of someone in that situation. That's basically what Tony Gilroy has focused on in Andor.\"\nStalin was, of course, not the only figure fomenting turmoil in Tsarist Russia, and Andor fleshes out other characters with attributes from the young Georgian's contemporaries. Among Andor's co-conspirators in the Aldanhi heist is Karis Nemik (Alex Lawther), an idealist writing a high-minded manifesto for the emerging resistance, similar to Bolshevik Leon Trotsky's polemics amid the opulent decline of Romanov rule.\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's character, Luthen Rael, is an analogue for Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader who was able to form a powerful movement from unlikely bedfellows. A wealthy art collector, Luthen's precise manners in front of his gilded customers hide an uncompromising hatred of the empire and a restless desire to fund a growing resistance. In Cassian's talented, taciturn thief he sees a useful tool; Lenin saw the same in Stalin. \"In 1911, people said to Lenin, 'Why are you using this guy? He's a gangster. He's had people killed. He was involved in all these bank robberies,'\" says Sebag Montefiore. \"And Lenin replies, 'He's exactly the type we need.' Stalin could edit a paper. He could write and could read. And he was also someone who could arrange a hit on somebody and arrange a bank robbery. That was what Lenin talked about: some people were tea drinkers, and other people were thugs, Stalin could do both, and that's why Stalin won in the end.\"\u00a0\nThe research into historical rebellions \u2013 Gilroy has said he studied other revolutions while writing Andor, as well \u2013 has no doubt helped create the show's oddly realistic feel. Andor feels more down to earth than anything the Star Wars universe has shown us before, if you'll excuse the occasional spaceship roaring overhead, or an alien or two sitting in the local bar. There are flashes of mundane detail rarely scene in big-budget sci-fi. People complain that Andor's mother Maarva's (Fiona Shaw) house is always too cold. Security officer Syril Karn's (Kyle Soller) petulant intensity even extends to tailoring his uniform to make him look smarter than his contemporaries. The Imperial Security Bureau hoping to root out the emerging rebellion is a nest of competing ambitions that feels as real as anything in a historical drama \u2013 or in everyday office politik. There are fewer blaster-toting Stormtroopers than there are in the Star Wars films, and more sadistic, trenchcoated officers who would have been right at home in the Tsarist secret police, the Okhrana, or its Soviet replacement, the Cheka.\n\"In the past, Star Wars movies drop us in at a very big moment,\" says Walter Marsh, an Australian writer who praised Andor's grown-up worldview in The Guardian in 2022. \"There's the big climactic battle, or Luke Skywalker's heroic journey, and they're these big themes of good versus evil. But as any historian will tell you, wars and empires and revolutions don't start and end overnight, and there's always this bigger backstory. There's this sort of long tail. It takes years for that kind of colonial rot, those systems of control, to set in.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Japanese film that Star Wars stole from\n\u2022 The truth about Henry VIII's right-hand man\n\u2022 Black Mirror's most 'devastating' episode ever\nAndor shows the corruption and brutal entitlement found at every layer of autocratic regimes: the guards drinking in a brothel while they're supposed to be on duty (and prepared to shake down anyone they don't like the look of); the prison industrial system that requires constant additions even if the new prisoners have done nothing wrong; the subtle sabotage of ethnic pilgrimages to sacred land that is earmarked for imperial development. And with authoritarianism on the rise around the globe, Andor has as much to say about today's world as it does about Stalin's.\u00a0\n\"When the show came out I think I was pleasantly surprised to see a story in that universe that was familiar, but which also approached this question of empire that's been so central to the whole franchise, but was never actually tackled in a really nuanced and human character-driven way,\" Marsh tells the BBC. \"It's all well and good to have a big, evil Sith Lord achieve global, universal domination. But how does power assert itself on the street level, from one human to another?\n\"The Empire is this huge grinding, unthinking machine, but it's also a very human thing,\" Marsh continues. \"Who are the people that find a place and thrive in those systems?\" He remarks that in the original films the Imperials were little more than blank-and-you-miss-them pantomime villains: \"British guys in suits getting choked by Darth Vader at some point, who are just fiddling with buttons in the background.\"\nAndor's strength is its \"three-episode arcs that showed us the kind of death by a thousand cuts that it takes to achieve this sort of social, political and economic dominance\", says Marsh. \"The converse of that is it shows all the ways in which that kind of oppression inspires pushback and resistance in all kinds of different ways.\"\nThe new season, which begins on Tuesday 22 April, will develop the rebellion's story as it rushes towards the events seen in Rogue One: the scenes of brutal Imperial reactions to a demonstration shown in the trailer evoke the Tsarist crackdown on a St Petersburg march in 1905, which was a\u00a0 slow-burning contributor to the Bolshevik revolution.\n\"The scavenger who becomes a passionate revolutionary leader is kind of fascinating,\" says Sebag Montefiore of the troubled Cassian Andor. \"That's a great trajectory, because that's exactly what Stalin did. And it'll be interesting to see how deep Gilroy uses that \u2013 how far he goes to create a character with both heroic and villainous features.\"\nGeorge Lucas's original film trilogy rooted the rebellion in the classic good-guys-versus-bad-guys dynamic of countless Saturday matinee cliffhangers, the resistance modelled after anti-Nazi opposition in occupied Europe. The rebels of Andor inhabit a much more compromised reality; like real-life revolutionary movements, they are much more complicated than the ones we usually see on screen. Luthen, Andor's Lenin proxy, considers it with chilling deliberation in one of the first season's standout scenes: \"I'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else's future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I\u2019ll never see.\"\nAs Sebag Montefiore notes, the revolutionaries themselves knew deep down that if they took power, they themselves would have to use repression as a tool; they would become what they once despised. \"Lenin himself said: 'A revolution without firing squads is meaningless.'\"\u00a0\nAndor season two is available on Disney+ from 22 April.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.\n\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.\nLucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.\nLucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.\nThe condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.\nLucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.\nThe abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.\n\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.\nThis is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.\nWithout medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.\nShe pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"\nAnd that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.\nIt is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.\nIn 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.\nIt is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.\n\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\" \nLucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.\nShe says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.\n\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"\nIP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.\n\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"\nIn response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.\nBut Lucy says responses have been different around the world.

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

Article 2 said the sides \"respect each other's territorial integrity and confirm the inviolability of existing borders between them\".\nThe war has been rife with accusations of treachery from the very beginning. \nGen Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of Ukraine's General Staff at the time, accuses Russia of going back on agreements allowing Ukrainian troops to pull out from the eastern town of Ilovaysk in August 2014. \nAs a result, withdrawing convoys came under fire, and at least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed.\nThe first major ceasefire agreement, signed on 5 September 2014 in Minsk, was broken within hours of being signed, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport. Attacks on other Ukrainian towns in the region, such as Debaltseve, continued, too.\nThis prompted the second attempted truce, known as Minsk-2, but it was even shorter. \nWithin minutes of it going into effect on 15 February 2015, observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported mortar and artillery fire in Donetsk. They were deployed to the war zone at Ukraine's request to monitor the security situation including any ceasefire violations, but they did not explicitly say who committed them.\nWhat followed was a string of other failed ceasefire attempts. Again, some were broken within minutes of coming into force.\nThey included Easter truces in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the \"school ceasefires\" of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 which were meant to allow schoolchildren near the frontline to go back to school in September, Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the \"bread ceasefires\" of 2017, 2018 and 2019 to allow the harvesting of grain, and others.\nA \"comprehensive ceasefire\" that went into effect on 27 July 2020 only lasted 20 minutes, according to Kyiv. Still, it had an effect on the fighting, halving the number of fatalities among Ukrainian soldiers in the following year.\nMatthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, argues that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith.\n\"Russia has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives,\" he says.\nBecause of various ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and Russia, \"the level of fighting has ebbed and flowed, and Ukraine bears some responsibility for part of that\", he tells the BBC. \n\"But the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat, and that informs things.\"\nJohn Herbst, a former US ambassador to Kyiv who now works for the Washington-based think-tank Atlantic Council, argues that Russia, not Ukraine was the \"serial violator\" of the Minsk ceasefire accords, the first and still one of the most comprehensive attempts to broker a truce in Ukraine.\nVerifying claims of ceasefire violations is not easy because almost all independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.\nBBC journalist Olga Ivshina, who was on the ground in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region reporting about the earlier stages of the war, says there were reports of Ukraine retaking villages in 2016-19, a successful Ukrainian offensive outside Mariupol, and Ukrainian tanks were spotted too close to the frontline, where they should not have been under the ceasefire deals.\n\"All of these were proclaimed as violations by Moscow. But of course they forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all,\" Ivshina says. \nDespite the Minsk accords, Russian-controlled forces launched an offensive against the town of Debaltseve, claiming that it was not covered by the ceasefire deal.\nZelensky has described the Minsk accords as a \"trap\" for Ukraine which allowed Russia to prepare for the full-scale invasion. \nPutin says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers had intended to implement the Minsk deals. Their fate was sealed when Russia declared the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" - separatist entities it had helped to set up - as independent states.\nPutin's \"Easter truce\" was never more than a lull, but President Trump said \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\".\nSo far there has been no indication that the Kremlin will accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, agreed to by Ukraine. \nTrump has already warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, \"we're just gonna take a pass\" and walk away.\nRussia's demand for \"the underlying causes of the conflict\" to be resolved suggest it has not moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty - through negotiations as well as military means.\nVladislav Surkov, a former close adviser to Vladimir Putin who was known as the \"grey cardinal\" of Russian politics, celebrates the Minsk accords last year as a way of \"legitimising\" Ukraine's initial partition.\nThe very idea of peace, he said, wass \"nothing but a continuation of war by other means\".",

        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Perched on top of Santorini's sheer cliffs is a world-famous tourist industry worth millions. Underneath is the fizzing risk of an almighty explosion.\nA huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.\nNow scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.\nBBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.\nJust weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.\nIt was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.\nProf Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.\n\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.\nThis work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent. \nSantorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".\n\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.\n\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.\nThe Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.\nBeneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.\n\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.\nThe robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.\nThose vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.\nThey are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.\nSo far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.\n\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.\nThe Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.\nThe two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.\nThe expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.\nShe is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.\n\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.\nIt will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.\nThese missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.\nJohn Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.\n\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"\nPointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"\nThese rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.\nBut the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.\nUsing a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found. \nThey have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.\nThey identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.\nThis is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.\n\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.\nThe recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.\nBack on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.\n\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.\nShe's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says.\nIn the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.\nShe believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting.\n\"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said.\nBut Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot.\nThe couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks.\n\"Actually we wanted to get married by a volcano,\" Tom says, his bride Kristina by his side.",

        "article_text": "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.\n\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.\nLucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.\nLucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.\nThe condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.\nLucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.\nThe abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.\n\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.\nThis is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.\nWithout medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.\nShe pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"\nAnd that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.\nIt is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.\nIn 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.\nIt is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.\n\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\" \nLucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.\nShe says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.\n\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"\nIP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.\n\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"\nIn response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.\nBut Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.\n\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.\n\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"\n\nLucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.\nNHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.\n\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"\nHer health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.\n\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"\nOnce she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.\nShe will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.\nOver a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.\nMeanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.\nThe embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.\nLucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.\n\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"\nA few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.\n\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.\n\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"\nYou can listen to Lucy Edwards on BBC Access All on BBC Sounds.

Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

        "article_text": "Fr Jorge Bergoglio often described Ireland affectionately as \"the green country\", recalling his first impressions of its landscape when, in 1980, he spent a short sabbatical in Dublin trying to improve his English.\nWhen the Argentinian priest made a return visit, in August 2018, he was known by a different name: Pope Francis.\nThe Vatican confirmed that Pope Francis died at the age of 88 on Easter Monday. \nDuring the 2018 visit, he became only the second pope in the church's history to set foot on Irish soil.\nJohn Paul II, who visited in 1979 at the height of the Troubles, famously told a crowd of 300,000 people in Drogheda: \"On my knees, I beg you to turn away from the paths of violence and return to the ways of peace.\"\nNearly 40 years later, at a state reception in Dublin Castle, Pope Francis lauded the work of those who negotiated the Good Friday Agreement and expressed his \"firm hope that the peace process will overcome every remaining obstacle and help give birth to a future of harmony, reconciliation and mutual trust\".\nHowever, the former Irish President Mary McAleese said the Pope \"took wrong advice\" when planning his visit to Dublin by not visiting Northern Ireland.\nIt was \"completely wrong-headed,\" she told BBC's Evening Extra programme.\n\"He should have gone,\" she added.\n\"The leaders of the protestant churches had invited him to Northern Ireland. Itself a wonderful, miraculous thing, and he didn't go... At the time there was no government in place in Northern Ireland and that might have weighed heavily in the thinking, but I also just think he got bad advice.\"\nArchbishop Eamon Martin, the primate of All Ireland, says the Pope often asked for updates on the Irish peace process when they met.\n\"He had a great interest in how things were in Northern Ireland, and how well the peace was developing. And he asked if he could make a message to Ireland to commend us on the journey of peace that we have taken and to encourage us to persevere on that road.\"\nArchbishop Martin believes that commitment to peace inspired the Pope's choice of papal name.\n\"He chose the name Francis, of course, and it was a daring thing to do.  He was the first Pope ever to use the name of the great Saint Francis of Assisi. \n\"And that message of peace, of praising God in creation, the message of brotherhood and sisterhood\u2014of fraternity\u2014characterised the pontificate of Pope Francis.\"\nBut between those two papal visits \u2014 from John Paul's passionate pleading for peace to Francis's endorsement of an historic peace process \u2014 Ireland had changed almost beyond recognition.\nA country once seen as a citadel of global Catholicism had seen plummeting church attendance as the moral credibility of bishops and priests was undermined by the twin forces of secularisation and the clerical abuse crisis.\nIn welcoming the Pope, then Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar told him Ireland was a more diverse, less religious place, a country which understood that \"marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions, and that families come in many different, wonderful forms, including those headed by a grandparent, lone parent or same-sex parents, or parents who are divorced\".\nAs Ireland's first gay head of government, Varadkar seemed to embody the social transformation he was describing.\nThe taoiseach also called for a \"new relationship between church and state\", urging the Pope to address the \"history of sorrow and shame\" laid bare by the abuse of vulnerable children.\nHours later, Francis met eight survivors of clerical abuse for 90 minutes at the Vatican embassy in Dublin.\nAt the final Mass in Phoenix Park the next day, the Pope recalled that meeting and then offered a series of apologies, written in his own hand, for the \"crimes\" of clerical abuse and made a public plea for forgiveness.\nFr Timothy Bartlett, who had a key role in planning the Pope's visit, says this \"penitential act\" was \"the most profound, eloquent and developed apology to those who had been hurt by abuse in the church\".\n\"I am absolutely satisfied that historians will look back at that and regard it as one of the most profound apologies ever given on this issue.\"\nIt was Fr Bartlett who gave the Pope the sheet of paper he used to pen that historic apology on the flight from the Knock Shrine to the Irish capital.\n\"I think it will go down as one of the most eloquent, personal and profound acknowledgements of all of that issue and hurt,\" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme on Monday.\n\"He had been dealing with all these other things, but he stayed attentive to the victims of abuse he had met the night before.\n\"That was what was dominant in his mind.\"\nArchbishop Martin thinks it is also significant that Pope Francis asked to meet with homeless people at the Capuchin Day Centre in Dublin.\n\"Pope Francis always exercised a preferential option for the poor, for those on the peripheries, for those who were not only poor materially, but who were excluded from society, or indeed from the church.\n\"He wanted to walk to them, to accompany them. I think that made him fearless in speaking quite prophetically to the church, to society and to the global world.\"\nWhen the Pope completed his 32-hour visit to Ireland, he returned to his home in Rome, where he had chosen to live amongst others in a Vatican guesthouse, rather than reside in the solitary splendour of the Apostolic Palace.\nMore than once, he publicly criticised bishops who spent large sums of money to support a lavish lifestyle. And he warned new cardinals not to see themselves as \"princes of the church\", but rather as servants.\n\"Humility\", the Pope would later say, \"is the gateway to all virtues.\"\nIt was this personal modesty that impressed so many who met Pope Francis\u2014even those outside the Catholic fold.\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson told BBC News NI that Pope Francis \"injected a level of humility that we don't often recognise within the Catholic Church, that you don't see through the opulence of St Peter's Basilica, Rome, the Vatican, the state that it is\". \n\"No flashy cars, no flashy suits, no flashy shoes. He was somewhat different and he brought the sort of early principles of Christian faith that I would recognise into a role that I see quite far apart from that. \n\"So he wanted to do things differently. He seemed a more gentle, humble, engaging, caring individual.\"",

        "article_text": "On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring an emergency at the US southern border and directed his top officials to evaluate whether to invoke a rarely used 19th-century law in response to immigration concerns.\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807 allows the president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the US. \nUS media report that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem, who were tasked with the assessment, will announce their recommendations later this week.\nSince returning to office, Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a central focus, and border crossings have reached a quarter-century low. But the  statute could further expand the president's powers. \nHere's what to know.\nThe 19th-century law would allow the use of active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties within the US.\nThis includes the National Guard - a branch of the US armed forces traditionally reserved for domestic emergencies and disasters. \nUS presidents can invoke the law if they determine that \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" against the government make it \"impracticable to enforce\" US law \"by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings\". \nOnce invoked, troops could be tasked with a range of duties, from quelling civil unrest and enforcing court orders to arresting and detaining migrants.\nBecause the Insurrection Act was written in broad terms, with little specific guidance on how and when the powers can be used, it gives presidents wide latitude in deciding when to mobilise military personnel for domestic operations.\nThroughout his election campaign, Trump vowed to crackdown on illegal immigration, calling the southern border situation a \"national emergency\" that could be better tamed by invoking the 19th-century statute.\nOn his first day in office in January, he asked for \"recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807\".\nThe administration has already rolled out a series of sweeping measures targeting the border. These include a nationwide deportation sweep and the controversial move to transfer alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador - a decision now facing legal challenges.\nThis comes as US Border Patrol has recorded just 8,300 migrant apprehensions, marking the lowest number of border crossings since 2000.\n\nThe Insurrection Act has been invoked a handful of times in American history. \nAbraham Lincoln used it when the southern states rebelled during the US Civil War, and former President Ulysses S Grant invoked it against a wave of racist violence by the Ku Klux Klan after the war.\nIn the 20th century, former President Dwight D Eisenhower invoked it so the US Army would escort black students into their high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, after the state's governor refused to comply with a federal desegregation order.\nMore recently, it was used in 1992 when massive riots broke out in Los Angeles over the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a black man. Then-President George Bush sent in active-duty members of the Marines and Army as well as National Guard troops.\nThe US government has traditionally worked to limit the use of military force on American soil, especially against its own citizens.\nThe Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 was enacted to restrict the military from acting as domestic law enforcement. In times of unrest, states typically deploy the National Guard to help maintain order.\nSince returning to office, Trump has expanded his authority by declaring national emergencies - a move that grants the presidency access to powers and resources that are normally restricted. He has used this authority to impose tariffs and, more controversially, to take action on immigration.\nIn March, following his emergency declaration at the border, Trump invoked the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport migrants he alleged were gang members.  Earlier this month, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked that effort.\nIf Trump chooses to invoke the Insurrection Act, it remains unclear what legal challenges he might face.",

Relieved? There was no toolbox, I had no-one to talk to about how I was meant to feel \u2013 so I just felt angry.\n\"Angry with myself for maybe not pushing more \u2013 angry with the NHS for taking one look at me and dismissing me because of my age, my demographic.\"\nThe actor's symptoms had developed over a number of months in 2021, and when she returned from three months filming in Spain she spoke to her GP about back pain and bloating. \nShe was referred for a scan, which revealed a four inch (10cm) tumour on her right ovary.\nAfter further investigations, she said a multi-disciplinary team at the hospital in Nottingham talked her through the results.\n\"They said because of my age, and the sort of cells that were inside my tumour, times that by X, multiply this by Y and Z - you don't have cancer,\" she said. \n\nShalisha was told there was a six-month wait for surgery to remove the tumour.\nShe returned to the set of Casualty, relieved not to have cancer, but still with a distended stomach and \"excruciating pain\".\n\"Bless the costume department - I couldn't really tell anyone, so I asked if they could just make my scrubs a bit bigger, because I couldn't have people thinking I was pregnant,\" she said. \nNot even Shalisha's family knew cancer was a possibility, as she did not want to scare them without knowing the full facts.\n\"It was a very lonely experience because it was just me and my husband going through this,\" she said. \nThings came to a head in the spring of 2022.\n\"One morning in early March I woke the whole house up screaming - my tumour was twisting inside my abdomen,\" Shalisha said. \n\"I couldn't keep painkillers down so we had to call an ambulance.\"\nFollowing surgery, doctors discovered the 12 inch by 12 inch (30cm x 30cm) tumour was mucinous ovarian cancer.\n\"I didn't let anyone apart from my husband and my best friend come and visit me in hospital, because I didn't want to see in my mum's eyes how sick I looked,\" Shalisha said. \nShe said processing her diagnosis also came with challenges, adding: \"The pamphlets and websites never showed anyone younger than 40, let alone a black woman.\"\nShe credits the nurses volunteering with charity Black Women Rising with saving her life.\n\"There were times where I was at a point that if I didn't speak to someone right then, I was going to lose my mind and spiral \u2013 and I didn't know how to climb out of that,\" Shalisha said. \n\"But even within that community, I still haven't met a young woman with mucinous ovarian cancer who is of my Caribbean heritage.\n\"There's a lot of culture there \u2013 a rich history that is instilled into me \u2013 of having my own back and being strong, and I needed another woman to be like 'girl, I get it, I understand'.\"\nShalisha also praised the after-care she received from the oncology team in Cardiff, but said her cancer had changed \"every single facet of life\" including her attitude to her own body.\nWhen she awoke from surgery she had around 29 staples down her stomach.\n\"It took me a long time to look in the mirror, and a while before I started to see how incredible it is and what it represents,\" she said. \n\"Every time I get changed I'm reminded of what my body went through \u2013 but three years on I'm so proud of this tiny body that has got me to where I am now.\"\nSince leaving Casualty in 2024 Shalisha has taken on a number of theatre roles, presented Saying Yes to Life for BBC Radio wales, and also worked with charities to raise awareness of ovarian cancer, even though talking about it can still be difficult.\n\"People assume because I'm an actor I'm good at talking - but in work people write lines for me,\" she added.\n\"Speaking about my experience is completely new to me.\"\n\"Mucinous ovarian cancer is a rare form of cancer and the complexities of a case can make it challenging to diagnose,\" said Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust's director of nursing and professions Rachel Boardman.\n\"However, where there are concerns, various tests and scans are used to identify the cancer, which would be assessed at a multidisciplinary level, in order to maintain an accurate diagnosis and a treatment plan to be delivered as quickly as possible.\"\nAsk Eve nurse Helen Hyndman said: \"I speak to many young women who get in touch with Ask Eve for advice who struggled to get their diagnosis of one of the five gynaecological cancers.\n\"Women tell me that they felt that because of their age, they were seen as 'too young' for cancer to be investigated.\"\nThere are five gynaecological cancers - womb, ovarian, cervical, vulval and vaginal.\nMs Hyndman said: \"The symptoms of the five cancers include abnormal vaginal bleeding, unexplained pelvic pain, changes to bladder or bowel habits or vulva itching, all of which can be caused by other much more common and less serious conditions. \n\"This means it's usually appropriate to test for other conditions before checking for cancer in younger women and people with gynae organs. \n\"But if you can't find a cause, or your symptoms persist or worsen, don't be afraid to mention the word cancer to your doctor and ask for tests.\"",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer.\nThe controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages.\n\"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\"\nWhite House officials have played down reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it.\nTrump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary.\n\"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media,\" he said. \"Try finding something new,\" he said. \nTrump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea  also floated by Hegseth earlier on Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".\nHegseth did not directly respond to reports of a second Signal chat, which were initially covered by the New York Times.\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.\nThe messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times. But it too appeared to share details of military operations against Yemen.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nAlthough the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents. Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices.\nThe second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth criticised the media and denounced the reports. He also said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\".\nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, the top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said the \"Trump-hating media\" was  \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza .

Trump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea  also floated by Hegseth earlier on Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".Hegseth did not directly respond to reports of a second Signal chat, which were initially covered by the New York Times.In a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.The messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices.EPAHegseth and his wife Jennifer Rauchet, who reportedly was part of the second Signal chat, attended the White House Easter egg rollFive takeaways from first leaked US military chat groupPentagon watchdog probing Hegseth's Signal app useFour lingering questions about 'Signalgate'What is messaging app Signal and how secure is it?The second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).Hegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".In a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired. Although the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel.Signal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents.",

        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "The Everglades' eclectic alligators are surprisingly diverse builders, bodyguards, commuters, and health-bringing engineers.\nFrom the edge of the Miccosukee Indian Reservation, in the north of the Florida Everglades, it is a short fan-boat ride through grassy swamp to get to an island that 18-year-old Hector Tigertail's family visit each year. For decades, this family \"hammock\" \u2013 as the tree-covered islands that poke out from the Everglades are known \u2013 has been their retreat; a place where the family can camp, cook and hunt. But they share this particular island with at least one permanent resident: an American alligator that, at around 7ft (2.1m) from nose to tail, is the largest female he's ever seen.\u00a0\nTigertail's family, members of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and this powerful reptile, which locals refer to as Mama Gator, have lived side by side for much of the 60-year-old animal's life, he explains. This intimate coexistence provides a chance to observe how alligators meticulously shape their surroundings. Through the dry season between December and May, she excavates a \"gator pond\" with her snout, claws and tail, a depression where water pools and she can wallow, keep cool and mate. At the start of the rainy season (from June to November), she builds a raised nest for her clutch of eggs, from mud, grass and twigs \u2013 a time when the humans know to keep a respectful distance from the protective mother. In return, for the next few years, they are often rewarded with the sight of Mama and her baby gators in tow.\u00a0\n\"We like to call her Mama Gator because she's everybody's grandma,\" says Tigertail.\nIn recent years, scientific research is adding support to something Florida's Miccosukee Tribe have long known: alligators like Mama play vital roles as \"guardians of the Everglades\" and engineer their environment in ways that protect freshwater ecosystems. Alligators carry around nutrients that feed ecosystem webs, and their ponds and nests provide refuges where plants, fish\u00a0and frogs live. New data hints that that alligators may also benefit us.\n\"Apex predator or not, alligators are actually very helpful and they can change the ecosystem significantly,\" says Tigertail, who researches alligators for the Miccosukee Tribe's Fish and Wildlife Department. \"During the dry season, a lot of animals \u2013\u00a0 deer, fish, otters, turtles, birds \u2013\u00a0 follow the alligators.\"\nFor those like biologist Christopher Murray who has spent decades closely studying alligators, it's high time to move past their reputation as cold-hearted killers and recognise the varied roles they're playing as caring and constructive ecosystem engineers. While the cute, herbivorous beaver is widely celebrated for stewarding temperate wetlands, it is the \"gnarly swamp monsters\" who deserve plaudits in the southeastern United States and many other places, says Murray, associate professor at Southeastern Louisiana University. \"I think we're just beginning to understand that crocodilians, in general, and specifically alligators, do a lot more good than we think.\"\u00a0\nAlligators are often called \"living fossils\", relatively untouched by major evolutionary changes for at least eight million years, with remarkably similar ancestors already hunting swamps alongside the dinosaurs. Yet, beginning in the 1850s, the arrival of rifle-wielding European settlers into the wetlands of Florida and Louisiana drove this evolutionary line to the verge of extinction.\u00a0\nMore than 10 million alligators were killed by commercial hunting up to the 1960s, driven by the popularity of their hides for bags, belts and boots, with others shot for sport or \"just for fun\" according to historical accounts. In 1967, American alligators were placed on endangered species lists, leading to nationwide hunting bans that allowed populations to recover. Today, the species is recognised as a standout conservation success story, as the population has rebounded to more than three million alligators estimated to live in the wild in the states of Florida and Louisiana, and thousands more spread across the south-eastern United States.\nJust as conservationists began fighting to save the species from extinction in the 1960s and 1970s, researchers began documenting their important ecological roles. In the wet season, the raised ridges around the edge of these nests are relatively dry land where some plants can escape flooding and provide platforms where smaller reptiles build their own nests. Meanwhile wading birds build their own nests above alligators, which act as \"bodyguards\", keeping raccoons and other predators away from the birds' eggs. (More recent research has shown that this is a macabre but overall mutually beneficial arrangement with alligators being rewarded with snacks from chicks that fall from the nests.)\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nMike Heithaus, professor of biological sciences at Florida International University, explains that, despite its lush appearances, the Everglades can be a nutrient poor environment. A largely flat wetland, dominated by grass-like plants, many key nutrients are carried out to sea by great slow-flowing seasonal rivers, some kilometres wide.\u00a0\nIn the dry season, when the water level falls, research since the mid-20th Century has shown that alligators' habit of excavating holes created variety in the otherwise monotonous landscape, with unique communities of plants, animals and algae around ponds. These holes can be architecturally diverse \u2013 created by one alligator or up to a dozen together \u2013 incorporating eclectic \"burrows and hidey-holes\", says Heithaus, including underwater caverns, where the alligator can stay submerged for hours. These aquatic environments form refuges in which fish like juvenile largemouth bass survive the dry season but can also be \"death traps\" which lure birds in search of a snack, he adds.\u00a0\nWe're now learning these are surprisingly dynamic systems. Research in 2023 showed that it was not only the construction of the ponds that counted \"but actively being in the pond matters\", says Heithaus. As the alligators move, they continually stir up the sediment to keep those nutrients in the water. \"The alligators are moving around; they're pooping in there. That's providing nutrients which algae \u2013 that form the base of the food web \u2013 rely on. So, you kind of prime the pump: you feed the bottom of the food chain and [the nutrients] come all the way up.\"\u00a0\nWithout alligators, there would be much less nutrients circulated in the water, says Heithaus. \"You put alligators there, and you get food and water, and that's happy times for most critters in the Everglades.\"\nThis research also reveals a lesser-seen side of alligators, spotlighting them as remarkably sophisticated and adaptable creatures. The alligator's reputation as a \"man-eating monster\" was inspired long ago by accounts like William Bartram's widely reproduced (and wildly inaccurate) stories of encountering alligators in Florida swamps with \"clouds of smoke\" erupting from their nostrils. Although attacks on humans are very rare, these cold-blooded animals remain feared by many as killers or \"weird swamp things\", says Murray, who has worked with alligators for more than two decades.\nThose who live up close with alligators see other qualities. One alligator in the state of Georgia, named Wally, was even docile enough to be domesticated as an \"emotional support alligator\", providing comfort and \"hugs\" to help alleviate his owner's depression.\u00a0\nDespite the reported gentleness of some individuals, it is recommended to stay at least 9m (30ft) away from alligators in the wild. Alligators are carnivores, powerful enough to bring down a wild deer or feral boar but \"naturally they're going to be more of a flighty, non-confrontational animal,\" says Kendall Osceola, who worked at the Miccosukee Indian Village, the tribe's cultural centre. The Miccosukee learn a strict set of rules from a young age for sharing their coastal homes with gators. \"We were always told if there's a body of water in Florida, there's going to be an alligator in there. So, keep a careful eye on any pets or anything small around the water line,\" she says. Yet Miccosukee stories depict them as \"benevolent creatures\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\n\u2022\u00a0How do you re-home a rhino? Upside down\n\u2022\u00a0Elephants hate bees - here's how that helps humans\n\u2022\u00a0A wild\u00a0'freakosystem' has been born in Hawaii\nToday, alligators have adapted to live in the urbanised environments of golf courses, canals and sewers. Researchers have been surprised by how varied and flexible alligators are, explains Heithaus, yet research in 2011 found behaviours that have shocked even those who study them. Near Miccosukee village, in an area where alligators live in mangrove forests alongside a fast-flowing river, Heithaus and Adam Rosenblatt fitted trackers to alligators, finding that similar alligators lived very different lives \u2013 some were \"couch potatoes\" who remain close to home, while others were \"commuters\" who travel long distances to coastal areas. \"Tag two alligators \u2013 same size, both males, 20m (65.6ft) apart on the shore \u2013 and one will not move more than 7km (4.3 miles) in total in three months, and the other might do 800km (497 miles),\" says Heithaus.\nWhile American alligators have been spotted swimming out in the ocean in the past, prior to this research this behaviour was believed to be extremely rare, says Heithaus. Unlike crocodiles, alligators lack specialised glands to process salt, yet this monitoring showed that some alligators frequently venture out into the ocean when there are abundant saltwater fish and crabs to feast on. \"When we first got some data suggesting the alligators were down in these saltwater environments for maybe 18 hours at a time, we were looked at like we had two heads \u2013 people didn't believe it at all,\" says Heithaus. \"And I think it's one of the cool things we're finding across sharks, alligators, and lots of animals \u2013 that there's a lot more behavioural adaptability and individual specialisation than we would have thought \u2013 bold individuals, shy individuals; exploratory individuals, stay-at-home individuals.\"\nHeithaus is aiming to figure out what causes these different behaviours \u2013 whether genetic or influenced by environmental factors \u2013 as well as what role \"commuting\" plays in cycling nutrients around wetland environments. Already, studies have shown that alligator ponds are richer in key nutrients like phosphorus and commuters are carrying nutrients up into the wetlands from coastal areas, by eating in the oceans and excreting upstream. \"We know that they're moving these nutrients upstream,\" says Heithaus. His team at the Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research Program is seeking a more granular understanding of how this affects the overall \"nutrient budget\" of the ecosystem, where nutrients are deposited, and how it affects the overall system.\nCrucially, at a time when the Gulf Coast is being hard hit by the impacts of climate change, we are also learning that alligators may affect their environments' ability to capture carbon. By analysing soil samples across Louisiana, Murray was recently able to demonstrate in a study that areas with high numbers of alligators are rich carbon stores. \"What this paper says to me is: look, we rescued the American alligator from extinction,\" he says, \"but what we didn't realise, back then, was that maybe we were actually doing a lot more for the environment \u2013 in the context of carbon sequestration and the battle against climate change \u2013 than we previously thought.\"\nThe next step, says Murray, is to show that alligators are actively contributing to higher carbon storage in these areas \u2013 and how. We have good reason to think alligators, as apex predators, may be playing a similar \"top-down\" role to the famed wolves of Yellowstone, whose return has reduced herbivore grazing on small trees and helped forests to regrow. The theory of trophic cascades developed by Utah State University ecologist Trisha Atwood has shown that apex predators are not only vital for ecosystem health but could have big impacts on CO2 dynamics. This could be particularly important in freshwater ecosystems like Louisiana's tidally inundated wetlands, which store enormous amounts of carbon, says Murray, but can turn into a carbon source when they dry out.\nMurray hopes his forthcoming research can provide further evidence about the value of supporting healthy alligator populations. Although hunting bans were the most important step to save the species from extinction, efforts to protect and restore populations are ongoing and involve groups who are often less recognised, he says. Among them are commercial alligator ranchers who retrieve eggs from the wild, incubate them and raise them through the first few years of life in enclosed or semi-wild environments, safeguarding them when they are most vulnerable to predation and disease. This form of early-years care, known as \"head-starting\", is common in conservation initiatives that aim to help endangered animals \u2013 from Eastern indigo snakes to burrowing owls. But, in Louisiana, this is a \"self-funded\" system driven by ranchers, says Murray. These ranchers are required to release 5% of alligators they raise into the wild, while the rest are treated as livestock that can be butchered for meat and hides.\u00a0\nIn the Everglades, head-starting is also carried out by the Miccosukee, who rescue eggs in years when water levels in the Everglades rise, threatening to drown eggs, or temperatures fall to levels that can harm baby alligators. \"Sometimes I would be at home and my uncle would tell me: 'Hey, the temperature is dropping really fast. It's going to be a really cold night. So get on the airboat and we have to go out there before the cold weather kills them',\" says Tigertail.\nDespite their fearsome reputation, all this hints at a future where humans and alligators coexist, with these reptiles recognised as \"helpful participants\" in solutions to the challenges we both face, says Murray. \"If you think historically, alligators and other crocodilians have been revered as a sacred entity in cultures around the world. Do they command respect? Yes. But are they monsters? Are they to be feared? No.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Pope Francis, who has died aged 88, made his final public appearance on Easter Sunday at the Vatican's St Peter's Square. \nAfter wishing the gathered crowd of more than 20,000 a happy Easter, he indicated that Archbishop Diego Ravelli, master of liturgical ceremonies, would read a message he had written.\nHere is the full text of his final public address, as released by the Vatican.\n\n\"Christ is risen, alleluia!\nDear brothers and sisters, Happy Easter!\nToday at last, the singing of the 'alleluia' is heard once more in the Church, passing from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart, and this makes the people of God throughout the world shed tears of joy.\nFrom the empty tomb in Jerusalem, we hear unexpected good news: Jesus, who was crucified, 'is not here, he has risen' (Lk 24:5). Jesus is not in the tomb, he is alive!\nLove has triumphed over hatred, light over darkness and truth over falsehood. Forgiveness has triumphed over revenge. Evil has not disappeared from history; it will remain until the end, but it no longer has the upper hand; it no longer has power over those who accept the grace of this day.\nSisters and brothers, especially those of you experiencing pain and sorrow, your silent cry has been heard and your tears have been counted; not one of them has been lost! \nIn the passion and death of Jesus, God has taken upon himself all the evil in this world and in his infinite mercy has defeated it. He has uprooted the diabolical pride that poisons the human heart and wreaks violence and corruption on every side. The Lamb of God is victorious! That is why, today, we can joyfully cry out: 'Christ, my hope, has risen!' (Easter Sequence). \nThe resurrection of Jesus is indeed the basis of our hope. For in the light of this event, hope is no longer an illusion. Thanks to Christ \u2014 crucified and risen from the dead \u2014 hope does not disappoint! Spes non confundit! (cf. Rom 5:5). That hope is not an evasion, but a challenge; it does not delude, but empowers us.\nAll those who put their hope in God place their feeble hands in his strong and mighty hand; they let themselves be raised up and set out on a journey. Together with the risen Jesus, they become pilgrims of hope, witnesses of the victory of love and of the disarmed power of Life.\nChrist is risen! These words capture the whole meaning of our existence, for we were not made for death but for life. Easter is the celebration of life! God created us for life and wants the human family to rise again! In his eyes, every life is precious! The life of a child in the mother's womb, as well as the lives of the elderly and the sick, who in more and more countries are looked upon as people to be discarded.\nWhat a great thirst for death, for killing, we witness each day in the many conflicts raging in different parts of our world! How much violence we see, often even within families, directed at women and children! How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalised, and migrants!\nOn this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas! For all of us are children of God!\nI would like us to renew our hope that peace is possible! From the Holy Sepulchre, the Church of the Resurrection, where this year Easter is being celebrated by Catholics and Orthodox on the same day, may the light of peace radiate throughout the Holy Land and the entire world.\nI express my closeness to the sufferings of Christians in Palestine and Israel, and to all the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. The growing climate of anti-Semitism throughout the world is worrisome. Yet at the same time, I think of the people of Gaza, and its Christian community in particular, where the terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.\nI appeal to the warring parties: call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace!\nLet us pray for the Christian communities in Lebanon and in Syria, presently experiencing a delicate transition in its history. They aspire to stability and to participation in the life of their respective nations. I urge the whole Church to keep the Christians of the beloved Middle East in its thoughts and prayers.\nI also think in particular of the people of Yemen, who are experiencing one of the world's most serious and prolonged humanitarian crises because of war, and I invite all to find solutions through a constructive dialogue.\nMay the risen Christ grant Ukraine, devastated by war, his Easter gift of peace, and encourage all parties involved to pursue efforts aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace.\nOn this festive day, let us remember the South Caucasus and pray that a final peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan will soon be signed and implemented, and lead to long-awaited reconciliation in the region.\nMay the light of Easter inspire efforts to promote harmony in the western Balkans and sustain political leaders in their efforts to allay tensions and crises, and, together with their partner countries in the region, to reject dangerous and destabilising actions.\nMay the risen Christ, our hope, grant peace and consolation to the African peoples who are victims of violence and conflict, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Sudan and South Sudan. May he sustain those suffering from the tensions in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region, as well as those Christians who in many places are not able freely to profess their faith.\nThere can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression and respect for the views of others.\nNor is peace possible without true disarmament! The requirement that every people provide for its own defence must not turn into a race to rearmament. \nThe light of Easter impels us to break down the barriers that create division and are fraught with grave political and economic consequences. It impels us to care for one another, to increase our mutual solidarity, and to work for the integral development of each human person.\nDuring this time, let us not fail to assist the people of Myanmar, plagued by long years of armed conflict, who, with courage and patience, are dealing with the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Sagaing, which caused the death of thousands and great suffering for the many survivors, including orphans and the elderly. We pray for the victims and their loved ones, and we heartily thank all the generous volunteers carrying out the relief operations. \nThe announcement of a ceasefire by various actors in the country is a sign of hope for the whole of Myanmar.\nI appeal to all those in positions of political responsibility in our world not to yield to the logic of fear which only leads to isolation from others, but rather to use the resources available to help the needy, to fight hunger and to encourage initiatives that promote development. These are the 'weapons' of peace: weapons that build the future, instead of sowing seeds of death!\nMay the principle of humanity never fail to be the hallmark of our daily actions. In the face of the cruelty of conflicts that involve defenceless civilians and attack schools, hospitals and humanitarian workers, we cannot allow ourselves to forget that it is not targets that are struck, but persons, each possessed of a soul and human dignity.\nIn this Jubilee year, may Easter also be a fitting occasion for the liberation of prisoners of war and political prisoners!\nDear brothers and sisters,\nIn the Lord's Paschal Mystery, death and life contended in a stupendous struggle, but the Lord now lives forever (cf. Easter Sequence). He fills us with the certainty that we too are called to share in the life that knows no end, when the clash of arms and the rumble of death will be heard no more. Let us entrust ourselves to him, for he alone can make all things new (cf. Rev. 21:5)!\nHappy Easter to everyone!\"",

        "article_text": "Last year, Alfie Watts went global, becoming the youngest ever winner of Race Across the World - the BBC show that does exactly what it says on the tin.\nTeams of two race to get from one part of the world to another with no air travel, no smartphones, no bank cards and a limited cash budget. \nAfter 50 days spent travelling by land and sea from Japan to Indonesia alongside his St Albans schoolfriend Owen Wood, it all came down to a foot race by a beach off the island of Lombok.\nThe series four finale saw the pair pip mother and daughter duo Eugenie and Isabel by a mere eight minutes to take the title and \u00a320,000 prize pot.\nIt also saw Alfie catch the travel bug, sending him on his way to a new career as a travel guru and online content creator.\nAs series five of the show gets underway on Wednesday, BBC News speaks to the 21-year-old about his new life on the road, advice for fellow travellers and tips for this year's contestants on how to win the show.\n\"The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,\" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.\n\"I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.\n\"And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is. \n\"And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.\"\nWatts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling further afield.\n\"Flights to Spain in the summer might be \u00a3300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,\" he notes.\n\"Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be \u00a3600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending \u00a320-25 a day maximum.\"\nSince his big TV win, he's been to around 30 countries, including five in one day for a Europe-based online challenge.\nAnother time he found and boarded the cheapest possible flights he could find online for seven days straight.\nAnd he also returned to Japan to pay a bill he felt he owed for some Kobe beef steaks that were kindly donated to him and Owen for free when they were worried about their budget, as fans of the show will remember. \"That was a really nice moment,\" he says.\nWatts likes to travel solo as he enjoys his \"own company\" and doing things on his \"own terms\", while also meeting new people.\nHe acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to \"throw yourself in\".\n\"I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,\" he says.\nHe does admit though that he once ended up in a taxi with an armed government official in Venezuela - a country he travelled to against UK goverment guidance.\n\"That was about as wacky as it got.\"\nHis favourite place he has been on his travels so far is \"without doubt\" Angel Falls in Venezuela, while his favourite country would be a coin flip between Jordan and Malaysia.\nOne thing he'd still like to tick off his bucket list is visiting the remote island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific Ocean, which sounds like a pitch for a new TV show in itself.\n\"It's the least visited country in the world,\" he explains.\n\"Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"\nAs well as becoming far better travelled, the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways, acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK, a mental health charity for young people, and Winston's Wish, a children and young people's grief charity.\nOne of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.\nSpeaking of his ambassadorial work, he says: \"I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].\n \"But internalising it, it can be quite challenging, listening to people's stories.\"\nRace Across the World resumes on Wednesday, with a new raft of contestants heading this time from north eastern China to the southernmost tip of India.\nThey include ex-spouses Gaz and Yin, and current couple Fin and Sioned, as well as sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, brothers Brian and Melvyn and mother and son duo Caroline and Tom.\nThe rules, as usual, are no smart phones, no bank cards (just a small cash budget) and no air travel.\nWatts thinks it's going to be a \"really tough route\" and \"a topsy turvey\" series.\n\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"\nHis \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".\nHe'd also suggest taking \"little travel placards\" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.\n\"I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.\n\"And I think we're probably going to see that this series, that people have been a lot more streetwise with how they've prepared.\"\nIs he worried about losing his title as the show's youngest winner?\nHe replies, like a true international diplomat, that he just wants the pair who \"nicely interact\" with the others and \"who genuinely appreciate the opportunity to travel\" to win.\n\"I think those are always the people that you want to do best, and if that happens to be the two 18-year-olds this time, then I'll be happy to hand my crown over.\"\nSeries five of Race Across the World begins on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Wednesday 23 April.",

        "article_text": "Leicester have been relegated from the Premier League after defeat to Liverpool \nThe banner flown over the King Power Stadium made its point. \n'King Power Clueless Sack The Board,' it read, just before Leicester City stepped into the last chance saloon for their game against Liverpool.\nA second relegation in three seasons, and instant return to the Championship, was confirmed soon afterwards as Trent Alexander-Arnold's second-half winner put the visitors within three points of the Premier League title.\nIt has been a calamitous season after last year's Championship triumph, with two managers, four wins and no home league goals for almost five months. \nThe drop had been coming - Leicester have won just once since December - and there was an air of resignation around the ground, even before Alexander-Arnold's strike. \nThere are unhappy and disconnected fans, players accused of giving up, and a manager in Ruud van Nistelrooy who, despite his pedigree as a player, has seen the Foxes get worse on his watch. \nThere were some boos at full-time, but the majority of home fans had already left. Those who stayed offered a smattering of applause, yet it was an empty gesture.\nIt reflected a club in need of a rebuild but how, and with who, are the biggest questions as Leicester - champions of England nine years ago - face one of their biggest crossroads.\nLeicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold moves Liverpool closer to title\n'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\n'My responsibility to lead the club in the best way' - Nistelrooy\nWhen the Foxes sacked Steve Cooper in October they were 16th, although the cracks were there.\nThe teething problems in moving away from Enzo Maresca's style - less expansive and working the ball quicker - were just part of the issue. \nThe departed Maresca, who led them to the Championship title last season before joining Chelsea, was well-liked by the squad and Cooper struggled to connect with players, even if some of the senior members of the squad - including Jamie Vardy - were onside. \nThere was growing concern from the club that any disconnect would impact their survival prospects, and one of the reasons why they dismissed Cooper. \nSo, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.\nFormer Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.\nYet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.\nThey have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.\nThe Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. \nThat is in stark contrast to the lack of goals under Van Nistelrooy - a revered striker for Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Netherlands - and they have scored just six times in the league since the draw with Brighton on 8 December.\nAnother goalless outing against Liverpool extended the home goal drought to nine league games and 810 minutes - the worst in top-flight history.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"They have some big decisions to make. It has been awful for them. They have been miles off it.\"\nSome players have recently raised concerns over the standard and intensity of training with the drop-off being connected to Leicester's impending relegation, which was becoming increasingly inevitable.\nThe fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks - Van Nistelrooy has dropped him for the last four games for refusing to agree to stay at the training ground one night a week - emphasises the growing tensions. \nWhen asked about whether he had been able to improve the standards and culture in his five months at the club, Van Nistelrooy was clear.\n\"When you don't combine them with results it's always hard. There's no negotiation on these standards and I hold everyone accountable on those,\" the Dutchman said this month. \n\"I know how I worked from a village of 5,000 people in the middle of nowhere to Manchester United and Real Madrid. I know what is necessary to stay at the highest level and I know there are so many people working at this football club who have the quality to do so. But not enough yet. \n\"In difficult moments you get to know people and characters very well. I speak about standards and what is needed to perform at the highest level and that's a culture which needs to be created in this club.\"\nDefender Conor Coady has been one trying to raise spirits at the club's Seagrave training base, but it has been an almost impossible task with results - and he admitted Leicester have not been good enough. \n\"We've took a bit of stick and we'll continue to take stick because it's deserved,\" said the former England centre-back. \"From minute one this season, we haven't been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it'll chew you up and spit you out.\"\nSusan Whelan, Jon Rudkin and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha watched Leicester's defeat to Liverpool\nAs the plane's banner suggested, director of football Jon Rudkin and the board have been the target for fans this season.\nThey see Rudkin as a root cause of their decline in recent seasons. He was, of course, in the same position when the Foxes stunned the world to win the Premier League in 2016, but supporters have made up their minds. \nIt does not help that the hierarchy rarely speak publicly, allowing supporters to understand and digest the situation.\nChief executive Susan Whelan twice met with the Foxes Trust and the club's Fan Advisory Board in February for candid and constructive meetings but the wider fanbase remain disconnected.\nDoes chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha decide to make a change at the top, does head of recruitment Martyn Glover's position come under more scrutiny following a number of poor transfer windows, regardless of financial constraints?\nVan Nistelrooy's position remains a doubt and it is hard to see a long-term future in the wake of damning statistics. \nDefeat against Liverpool leaves him with the unenviable record of having lost 17 of his 22 games, winning just three. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?\nVan Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.\n\"It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there.\n\"The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it. In a situation like this you have to sit very carefully with the club to discuss the matters.\"\nYet sacking a second manager of the season has financial consequences and with money tight, it will be a consideration. Can Leicester financially afford to sack Van Nistelrooy but, going forward, can they afford not to?\nThere is also an acceptance the squad needs a reset but only three players are out of contract - goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, and 38-year-old captain Jamie Vardy. \nWhat happens with Vardy - influential at the club as their last remaining title winner and the scorer of 198 goals - remains open, but it's the biggest decision the club has to make in terms of the squad given his reputation and achievements.\nIt means Leicester must shift big earners to make wholesale changes to a squad which has, in the main, brought them down twice.\nWilfred Ndidi signed a new three-year contract last summer but his appetite for another Championship campaign is likely to have waned and the same will go for defenders Ricardo Pereira and Wout Faes. Although, as part of Leicester's decline, they must find takers.\nGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been a rare bright spot and will have his admirers, as will Bilal El Khannouss, despite an underwhelming first season in England, while Winks' situation could depend on Van Nistelrooy's exit. \nLike every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.\nLeicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.\nYet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float.  \nFor now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with.\nThey made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. This time their short-term future is far less certain.",

A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.\n\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.\n\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\" \nThe skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.\n\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.\n\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"\nArtefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.\nShards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.\n\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.\n\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"\nThe presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.\nThe team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.\nThey have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.\nOsteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s. \nHer skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.\n\nTen of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.\nThe results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.\nFurther DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.\nThe team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.\nBecause of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.\n\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.\n\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"\nThe dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.\nAndy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.\n\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.\n\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people.

        "article_text": "The baba is often served at Easter in Poland, with the most extraordinary version \u2013 the muslin baba \u2013 made from a rich dough of flour, yeast, butter and quite a lot of egg yolks.\nDepending on where it's baked, the baba or babka takes on many different forms. In the US, it's a braided brioche-like bread that often has chocolate, nuts or other ingredients mixed in. Europeans might be more familiar with baba au rhum, a desert popular in France and Italy that is soaked in liqueur and served in individual portions.\nBut in Poland, the word \"baba\" can refer to a variety of baked goods. Some are made in Bundt pans, while others are loaf shaped. Some are more bread-like and use yeast while others more closely resemble pound cake, like the lemon baba I made for my son's birthday. And some, like the potato babka so popular in Poland's Podlasie region, are savoury instead of sweet.\n[jump to recipe]\nThe typical yeasted baba is often served at Easter and added to the Easter basket brought to church to be blessed, with the most extraordinary version being the muslin baba named for muslin cloth because of its lightness. It's made from a rich dough that contains flour, butter, yeast and a lot of egg yolks \u2013 96 of them for every kilogram of flour.\nOne food website says to \"take a deep breath\", as the home version of the muslin baba recipe calls for just 250g of flour, so you will only need 24 egg yolks. By contrast, the Easter baba recipe I usually make contains six egg yolks for 500g of flour (or 12 egg yolks per kilogram), and I already consider that to be a lot.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table\u00a0\"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nThe original recipe for muslin baba is often credited to the 19th-Century food writer and journalist Lucyna \u0106wierczakiewiczowa, an extremely popular and successful cookbook writer at the time. I came across the recipe in two other cookbooks: Jak Gotowa\u0107 (How to Cook) by Maria Disslowa, first published in 1931, and then again in\u00a0Old Polish Traditions in the Kitchen and at the Table\u00a0(published in 1979) by Maria Lemnis and Henryk Vitry, both pseudonyms of Polish musicologist Tadeusz \u017bakiej, which provides fascinating insights into the life and traditions of pre-war Poland.\n\"The cook, the lady of the house and all the women locked themselves up in the kitchen,\" \u017bakiej writes. \"They sieved the whitest of flours, mixed hundreds of egg yolks with sugar in clay bowls, dissolved saffron in vodka.\"\nThis is not the easiest of recipes. It requires long mixing and rising times and keeping an eye on the oven during baking to prevent burning (not to mention having to crack so many eggs). In other words, making baba was serious business.\nSome say that the name \"baba\" (the word for \"woman\" in Polish) referred to the fact that the dough was finnicky and moody, \"just like a woman's temperament\". And men weren't allowed into the kitchen during baking as it was thought their presence could lead to a failed, undercooked cake. While the dough was rising, it would be covered in a linen tablecloth and doors and windows were sealed to prevent drafts. After baking, the baba rested on cushions, and because it was thought to be so sensitive until it fully cooled, everyone would whisper because it was believed loud noises would cause it to collapse. Sometimes, after taking the baba out of the oven, the kitchen would be filled with sobbing: \"A burned or collapsed baba was a terrible faux pas,\" \u017bakiej writes.\nBut one question remains, why the extreme amount of egg yolks?\n\"Egg yolks contain lecithin, which acts as natural leavening agent,\" says Jacek Malarski, the co-founder of Lukullus, a Warsaw-based bakery that sells the 96-egg yolk baba (or as they call it, Baba 96). \"Adding a large amount of yolks results in a tender and fluffy texture, and adding an extreme amount of egg yolks results in an extremely fluffy texture, like a cloud.\"\nBecause of their high fat content and emulsifying properties, the egg yolks also make the baba last for longer without having to add any preservatives and give the finished product a beautiful golden-yellow colour.\u00a0\nIn the past, serving such a rich pastry was a status symbol. \"Fat was more expensive than even the most expensive of meats,\" says Jaros\u0142aw Dumanowski, a food historian at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru\u0144. The recipe also calls for 400g of butter for every kilogram of flour, which acts as carrier for the vanilla flavour. Some households even added saffron, one of the most expensive spices. \"These were exotic things from far away so that rich people could distinguish themselves from the rest,\" Dumanowski says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Poland's famous gingerbread from Torun\n\u2022 The dumpling that comforts Poland\n\u2022 Bebinca: a multi-layered egg yolk cake\nWhen Malarski and his partner, Albert Judycki, decided to offer a baba at Lukullus bakery, they tested several dozens of versions, both old and modern, before deciding on a clear winner: the muslin baba. \"The muslin baba was beyond compare. It melted in your mouth and remained fresh for longest,\" Malarski says. They use bourbon vanilla from Madagascar and cover the Baba 96 in homemade lemon glaze. The muslin baba has been making a regular appearance at Lukullus at Easter ever since.\nWhen I ask Malarski about the popularity of this particular baba despite it being so rich and labour-intensive, he replied: \"It's the best. If someone tries it, they never want to go back. They miss it too much.\"\nMuslin baba recipe\nAdapted from Old Polish Traditions in the Kitchen and at the Table\nIngredients\n24 egg yolks*\n300g sugar, setting aside 1 tsp\n\u00bd cup lukewarm milk\n60g fresh yeast (or substitute 21g of instant yeast instead)**\n250g flour, setting aside 1 tsp of flour\n1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped out (or substitute 1 tsp vanilla extract)\n100g butter, melted, plus more for the Bundt pan\nlemon glaze (optional)\ncandied orange or lemon peel (optional, for decoration)\nMethod\nStep 1\nIn a heated bain-marie, beat the egg yolks and sugar (what remains after separating out 1 tsp) until white and fluffy. The original recipe calls for half an hour by hand with a whisk but with an electric mixer, 10 minutes should be enough. Set aside to cool.\u00a0\nStep 2\nHeat up the milk until lukewarm and add the yeast, 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp flour. Let rest until bubbly, around 5 minutes.\nStep 3\nAdd this mixture, with the remaining flour and vanilla bean seeds or vanilla extract to the egg yolks and sugar and beat for another 10 minutes.\nStep 4\nAdd the melted (but not hot) butter, beat for another 10 minutes, then leave the dough to rest in a warm place until doubled in size. The dough will be loose, more like a cake batter than yeast dough. (You won't be able to knead it, not by hand and not with the dough hook. Even the stretch-and-fold technique, typically used when handling wetter doughs, will fail here.)\nStep 5\nWhen it has doubled in size, carefully transfer it to a buttered 4-liter-sized Bundt pan.\nStep 6\nAllow it to rest in a warm spot until the dough has risen out of the form. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 170C/340F.\nStep 7\nCarefully transfer the baba to the hot oven and bake for 35-40 minutes but keep a good eye on it as the high amount of egg yolk and sugar may cause it to burn easily. A toothpick inserted into the baba should come out clean. Allow to cool.\nRemove from the pan, then decorate with lemon glaze (a mix of lemon juice and powdered sugar to taste), or candied orange peel if you wish.\nNotes\n* If 24 yolks seems excessive to you, you can halve the recipe and make a smaller baba.\n** Some people online have suggested decreasing the amount of yeast to 45g.\nThis story was originally published in 2024.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0\n\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.\nIt also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.\nThe College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.\nWith 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.\nFor the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European. \nAnd although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".\nFor those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.\nCould the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?\nHere are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.\nNationality: Italian\nAge: 70\nSoftly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.\nHaving acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.\nHe is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.\nBut he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".\nThe bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"\nSome 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.\nNationality: Filipino\nAge: 67\nCould the next pope come from Asia?\nCardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.\nThe Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.\nHe is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.\nHe has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.\nBut in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.\nThe cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.\nAsked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"\nNationality: Congolese\nAge: 65\nIt's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\nHe has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.\nHe is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".\nThough Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.\nBut in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"\nSuch comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.\nNationality: Ghanaian\nAge: 76\nIf chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.\nLike Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.\nAsked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".\nHe was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.\nLike Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.\nA guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.\nLike many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.\nIn a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.\nIn 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.\nNationality: Hungarian\nAge: 72\nA cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.\nHe is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.\nThe archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.\nErdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.\nHis conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.\nNationality: Italian\nAge: 83\nOnly cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.\nThe former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.\nHis name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".\nFrancis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.\nNationality: German\nAge: 71\nGermany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.\nThe Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.\nHe has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.\nBut in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.\nTwo years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.\nNationality: Canadian\nAge: 80\nCardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.\nFor years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.\nAs another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.\nOuellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.\nHe opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".\nNationality: American\nAge: 69\nCould the papacy go to an American for the first time?\nChicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.\nTwo years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.\nHe worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.\nPrevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.\nHe is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.\nNationality: Guinean\nAge: 79\nWell-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.\nThe son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.\nHe has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.\nWhile not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.\nNationality: Canadian\nAge: 78\nCardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.\nAlthough he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.\nHe has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.\nCzerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis.

And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.LIVE UPDATES: Follow the latest after the Pope's deathIN PICTURES: Symbolism on show as Pope lies in open coffinEXPLAINER: Key candidates in an unpredictable contest to be the next PopePROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin FarrellPietro ParolinGetty ImagesNationality: ItalianAge: 70Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the pope's chief adviser. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. That resignation was rejected by Francis.Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.Marc OuelletReutersNationality: CanadianAge: 80Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".Robert PrevostGetty ImagesNationality: AmericanAge: 69Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. He has also spoken against euthanasia.But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke!",

        "article_text": "He had tea with the Queen, was blessed by the Pope and spread Hawaiian culture across the globe. More than a century later, a festival dubbed the \"Olympics of hula\" honours his legacy.\nSilence engulfed the audience at Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, Hawai'i, as a group of hula dancers appeared on stage. They moved gracefully in unison, rhythmically depicting a scene of an ancient Hawaiian myth as they bellowed \nmele\n (chants). The hula performance, which was part of the annual \nMerrie Monarch Festival\n, wasn't a mere spectacle; it was a powerful celebration of Hawaiian culture \u2013 and for years, it was banned.\nThe week-long Merrie Monarch Festival (which takes place 20-26 April 2025 and is celebrating its 62nd anniversary) has been called the \"\nOlympics of hula\n\" and perpetuates the sacred, centuries-old practice of dancing and chanting that preserves and portrays our native Hawaiian language, history, religion and culture. Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 best \nh\u0101lau\n (hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.\n\"It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,\" said K\u016b Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. \"And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King Kal\u0101kaua.\"\nFondly dubbed \"The Merrie Monarch\", King David La'amea Kal\u0101kaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislature\u00a0decided to elect a native\u00a0ali'i\u00a0(noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and Kal\u0101kaua took the oath of office the following day.\nBy the time of Kal\u0101kaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed \"vile heathen chants\".\nKal\u0101kaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the motto Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0(Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians \u2013 all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As Kal\u0101kaua famously proclaimed: \"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\"\u00a0\nTo many people around the world, \"hula\" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians \u2013 an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.\nAs part of Kal\u0101kaua's Ho'oulu L\u0101hui\u00a0policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and l\u016b'au \u2013\u00a0all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later, \nho'opa'a \n(chanters) and \n'\u014dlapa \n(dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity Kal\u0101kaua revived.\n\"[Kal\u0101kaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,\" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have the \nKumulipo\n (a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\nYet, Kal\u0101kaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the \"Merrie Monarch\" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring by\u00a0spending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.\nDuring Kal\u0101kaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds of\u00a0Hawai'i Pono'\u012b\u00a0(the Kingdom's national anthem, which Kal\u0101kaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, Kal\u0101kaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.\u00a0'Iolani Palace\u00a0(which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights \u2013 five years before the White House did.\n\"He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],\" said Kenneth \"Aloha\" Victor, a kumu hula (master hula teacher) and designer of Kaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, Kal\u0101kaua maintained consulates and legations in more than 130 cities across the globe. The Kingdom had 13 consulates in Great Britain alone.\nBack at home, during an era of increased literacy, Kal\u0101kaua met with traditional na kahuna (priests) and na kapuna (elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book, Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.\u00a0\nMore like this\n:\n\u2022 The word embodying the spirit of Hawai'i\n\u2022 A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu\n\u2022 Hawaii's ancient land management system\nKal\u0101kaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of the Hawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art.\u00a0More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands: Princess Abigail Kaw\u0101nanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.\nA multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, Kal\u0101kaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be found hosting royal l\u016b'aus\u00a0for foreign dignitaries and heads of state.\nFor Hawaiians today, Kal\u0101kaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. \"When Kal\u0101kaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,\" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. \"It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.\"\nFor those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. \"Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,\" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.\nOf course, Kal\u0101kaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, l\u016b'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world. Visitors can experience this first hand at O'ahu's Polynesian Cultural Center, which hosts a traditional Hawaiian l\u016b'au paying homage to Queen Lili'uokalani (Kal\u0101kaua's sister, who succeeded him until white businessmen\u00a0overthrew the Kingdom in 1893), while the Queen Emma Summer Palace\u00a0in Honolulu offers contemporary hula lessons for adults.\nOn Maui, immersive experiences at the\u00a0Grand Wailea\u00a0include an E Ala E\u00a0oli\u00a0(chant) in the mornings on the beach, while interactive language lessons teach guests how to pronounce words in\u00a0\u02bb\u014clelo Hawai'i\u00a0(Hawaiian). Beachside resorts like\u00a0Outrigger Reef in Waikiki Beach are adopting a regenerative tourism approach at its A'o Cultural Center by allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and \u2013 yes \u2013 participate in hula lessons.\n\"It all spawns back to [King Kal\u0101kaua's] creed,\" said Victor. \"That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.\"\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story stated that\u00a0US sugar planters overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i. This statement has been corrected.\nThis article has been updated from its original 2023 publication.\n---\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0\n\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of creating an \"impression\" of a ceasefire while still taking military actions in some places in Ukraine.\nIn the first six hours of the \"Easter truce\" - as ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin - Zelensky said there had been 387 shellings and 19 assaults by Russian forces, and drones used 290 times. There are no reports of casualties.\nPutin ordered his forces to \"stop all military activity\" in Ukraine from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday. Kyiv said it would also adhere.\nRussia's defence ministry insisted all Russian forces had been adhering to the truce and accused Ukraine's army of breaking it.\nRussia said Ukrainian units fired at the positions of Russian troops 444 times, carried out 900 strikes with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), 12 shellings, 33 strikes by UAVs and seven drops of munitions. The ministry said there were dead and wounded among the civilian population. It did not give any details.\nZelensky on Sunday morning said Moscow was \"trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine.\"\nAccusing Russia of specific military actions, Zelensky added that \"everywhere our warriors are responding as the enemy deserves, based on the specific combat situation.\"\nBecause Putin's ceasefire was announced minutes before it was due to take effect, an immediate, complete pause was always unlikely, but the BBC in Ukraine reports it has been quieter on the front lines.\nBefore Zelensky said there had been continued attacks in some areas, at midnight on Saturday there were no reported Russian drones or fighter jets in Ukrainian skies. \nThat is very rare.\nThe only report was that a Russian ship with missile launchers had been deployed to the Black Sea. \nIn the southern city of Odesa, it was silent. On Friday, before Moscow's announcement, air defences crackled throughout the night as Russian drones flew in from the direction of occupied Crimea.\nLate on Saturday - hours into the truce - Zelensky had said: \"If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russia's actions.\" \n\"Our actions are and will be symmetrical. The proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table \u2014 the answer to it must come from Moscow,\" he wrote on X. \nZelensky said Ukraine would be ready to extend a truce beyond 20 April, seemingly referring to an earlier proposal from the US for a 30-day ceasefire which Ukraine had already agreed to. \nIt seems now both Moscow and Kyiv want to show Washington they are serious about peace. The question of whether the Kremlin accepts Zelensky's offer to turn this truce from a 30-hour one to a 30 day one is central to any potential path to peace.\nFew Ukrainians think that is remotely possible.\nPutin had announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov.\n\"Based on humanitarian considerations... the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period,\" Putin told Gerasimov.\n\"We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.\"\nThe Russian defence ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was \"mutually respected\" by Ukraine.\nIt is not the first time a pause in fighting has been suddenly announced - a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 fell apart after both sides failed to agree on a proposal. \nReacting to the recent truce announcement, a UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for - not just a one day pause for Easter.\"\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides. \nThe US has been directly talking to Russia as part of its efforts to end the war, but has struggled to make major progress. \nLast month, Moscow came up with a long list of conditions in response to a full and unconditional ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine.\nUS President Donald Trump on Friday warned Washington would \"take a pass\" on brokering further talks on ending the war in Ukraine unless there was quick progress.\nHe was speaking after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not \"going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end\", as it had \"other priorities to focus on\".\n\"We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable,\" he added. \n\"If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on.\"",

Kenji Kanasugi, Japan's ambassador to China said Zhong had requested to speak to the victim's family, but did not say if he had been targeting Japanese nationals.\nThe incident has also shone a light on the unchecked nationalism on Chinese social media, which has fuelled anti-foreigner sentiment in recent years.\nOnline commentators noted that the schoolboy's killing had happened on a politically sensitive date - 18 September, the anniversary of an incident that led to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in China in the early 1930s.\nHistorical grievances have long overshadowed political tensions between China and Japan. China has long demanded an apology from Japan for its colonial and wartime aggression in the early and mid 20 Century. It has also accused Japan of glossing over its brutal military actions in China in its history textbooks. \nThe stabbing also came amid a spate of high-profile attacks on foreigners in China, including the stabbing of four American teachers in Jilin.\nLast June, a man attacked a Japanese mother and her child at a bus stop in Suzhou but ended up killing a Chinese woman trying to protect them.

        "article_text": "After fleeing Silicon Valley for political and business reasons, Elon Musk is building a corporate campus in rural Texas \u2013 but his new neighbours have mixed views.\nHalf an hour east of Austin, past the airport, the clogged-up traffic starts to melt away and the plains of Central Texas open up, leaving the booming city behind.\nSomewhere along the main two-lane highway, a left turn takes drivers down Farm-to-Market Road 1209. It seems like an unlikely address for a high-tech hub, but that's exactly what Elon Musk, the world's richest man and one of President Donald Trump's closest allies, hopes it will become.\nCourt filings indicate that a large metal building finished in the last few months will be the new headquarters of X, his social media platform.\nA short distance away, a large logo of the Boring Company, Musk's infrastructure company, is plastered on the side of another headquarters.  And across FM 1209 is a rapidly growing SpaceX facility which manufactures Starlink satellite internet equipment.\nLike most technology tycoons, Musk had long made Silicon Valley his home and headquarters. Once a supporter of the Democrats, his move to Texas is part of a larger tech world trend and also appears to reflect his own transformed ideological views.\nHere the land is (relatively) cheap, skilled tech workers from nearby Austin are plentiful, and local laws are favourable to development.\nOf course, there are also specific political angles to the move.\nIn July 2024, Musk said he was quitting California after the state passed a law prohibiting teachers from enforcing rules about notifying families when students' gender identity changes. \nMusk has an estranged transgender daughter and has spoken out against what he calls \"woke mind virus\" - which he describes in interviews as divisive identity politics - along with anti-meritocratic and anti-free speech ideas.\nAnd so Musk upped sticks and headed to Texas, a Republican stronghold and the fastest-growing state in the US.\n\nIn addition to the cluster of buildings near Bastrop in central Texas, he has built a SpaceX facility in Cameron County, on the southern tip of Texas near the border with Mexico. SpaceX employees there have filed a petition to create a new town called Starbase. The measure will go to a vote in May.\nLocals in Bastrop have mixed feelings about the development.\n\"It's almost like we have a split personality,\" says Sylvia Carrillo, city manager of Bastrop, which has a growing population of more than 12,000. \"Residents are happy that their children and grandchildren will have jobs in the area. \n\"On the other hand it can feel like we are being overwhelmed by a third party and that the development will quickly urbanise our area,\" she says.\nAlthough the Musk development is technically outside of the city's limits, it's close enough that Texas laws give Bastrop's government sway over development. And, Ms Carrillo stresses, the Musk buildings are just one example of many developments springing up in a booming area.\n\"He's faced a backlash that is not entirely of his own creating,\" she says.\n\"But now that he's here and things are changing quickly, it's a matter of managing\" issues like house and land prices and the environment, she says.\nThe Musk compound is still fairly bare-bones. The grandly named Hyperloop Plaza sits in the middle of the corporate buildings, and is home to the company-owned Boring Bodega, a bar, coffee shop, hairdresser and gift shop.\nOn a recent windy Sunday afternoon, a video game console sat unplayed in front of a couch near a display of company T-shirts, while a few children scurried back and forth to a playground outside.\nThe developments in Bastrop fit right into the quickening pace of activity across central Texas, where cranes perpetually loom above the Austin skyline and the housing market is a perpetual topic of conversation.\nThe area has gone through various industry booms and busts over the years, including lumber and coal mining, says Judy Enis, a volunteer guide at the Bastrop Museum and Visitor Center. \nDuring World War Two, tens of thousands of soldiers - and around 10,000 German prisoners of war - poured in to Camp Swift, a US Army facility north of the town.\n\"That probably had more of an impact than Elon Musk,\" Ms Enis notes.\nViews of the tycoon are mixed, to say the least, and inseparable not only from his politics but also opinions on economic development, in what still is a predominately rural area.\nJudah Ross, a local real estate agent, says the development has supercharged population growth that started as a result of the Austin boom and accelerated during the Covid pandemic.\n\"I'm always going to be biased because I want the growth,\" Mr Ross says. \"But I love it here and I want to be part of it.\n\"If nothing else, what's good is the amount of jobs that this is bringing in,\" he says. \"In the past year,  I've sold to people working at Boring and SpaceX.\"\nAlfonso Lopez, a Texan who returned to the state after working in tech in Seattle, says he initially picked Bastrop figuring he would make a quick buck on a house purchase and move on. \nInstead, he quickly became enamoured with the town, its mix of local businesses and friendly people, and wants to stay.\n\nMr Lopez is no big fan of Musk and is critical of some of his management practices and politics, but admires the technology his companies have built and is happy to live nearby as long as the companies are good neighbours.\n\"As long as they don't ruin my water or dig a tunnel beneath my house and create a sinkhole, this isn't bad,\" he says, gesturing around the metal shed housing the bodega, coffee shop and bar. \"I'll come here and watch a game.\"\nHis concerns about water are more than theoretical. Last year The Boring Company was fined $11,876 (\u00a38,950) by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality after being cited for water pollution violations.\nThe Boring Company initially planned to dump wastewater in the nearby Colorado River but, after local pressure, signed a deal to send the sludge to a Bastrop wastewater treatment plant.\nThe water issues appear to have delayed housebuilding, which reportedly could include more than 100 homes for Musk employees. The planned development of homes has so far failed to materialise, however. For now, the extent of living quarters is a handful of temporary trailers behind the bodega building, surrounded by a wall, acres of Texas plain and a few horses munching grass. Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says any large-scale home building is at least a year off.\n\nIn November, SpaceX applied for a free trade zone designation, which would allow it to move materials and finished products in and out of the Bastrop factory without being subject to tariffs - one of Donald Trump's signature policies. \nIt's a common practice for manufacturers, and there are hundreds of similar zones across the country.\nLocal officials in Texas have endorsed the proposal, saying it will boost the local economy, despite costing the county an estimated $45,000 (\u00a334,800) in revenue this year. \nThe company is also getting an injection of $17.3m (\u00a313.4m) from the Texas government to develop the site, a grant that officials say is expected to create more than 400 jobs and $280m in capital investment in Bastrop.\nFew local residents wanted to directly criticise Musk when standing face-to-face with a visiting reporter. But it's a different story online, where sharper feelings shine through. \n\"They will ruin everything nearby,\" one resident posted on a local online forum. \"Nothing good comes with him.\" \n\nThe BBC contacted SpaceX, The Boring Company and X for comment.\nMs Carrillo, the city manager, says she hasn't picked up on much personal anger on the part of locals prompted by Musk's activities in Washington. \nBut to protect Bastrop, she says, the city has recently enacted laws limiting housing density and providing for public parks - measures that she says will keep the \"historic nature\" of the well-preserved downtown while allowing for growth on the outskirts.\nBastrop, she says, is a conservative, traditionally Republican place.\n\"His national stuff doesn't really register,\" she says. \"His companies have been good corporate citizens, and we hope it can stay that way.\"",

        "article_text": "A Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration has been moved to a new prison, US Senator Chris Van Hollen has said.\nThe Democratic senator was speaking after returning from El Salvador where he met Kilmar \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, who was sent to the notorious mega-jail Cecot (Centre for the Confinement of Terrorism) last month.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda was \"traumatised\" and fearful of other prisoners while inside the facility, Van Hollen said, adding that he was moved to another facility in the country over a week ago.\nThe Supreme Court has ordered the government to \"facilitate\" his return, however Trump administration officials have continued to push back against the order.\nThe White House accuses him of being a member of the transnational Salvadoran gang MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organisation, and has said he will not return to the US. \nOn Sunday, Van Hollen appeared on all major US Sunday morning programmes to express his frustration with how the Trump administration has handled Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda's mistaken deportation. \n\"I am not defending the man,\" he said in an interview with ABC News. \"I'm defending the rights of this man to due process.\"\nVan Hollen stressed that he went to El Salvador to ensure both the rule of law and the right to due process before the courts are upheld. \"If we take it away from [Mr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda], we do jeopardise it for everybody else,\" he said.\nMr \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda has never been convicted of a crime.

        "article_text": "Stock markets around the world have been relatively settled this week after a period of chaos, sparked by US trade tariffs.\nBut investors are still closely watching a part of the market which rarely moves dramatically - the US bond market.\nGovernments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest.\nRecently, in an extremely rare move the rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell.\nThe volatility suggests investors were losing confidence in the world's biggest economy.\nYou may think it's too esoteric to bother you, but here's why it matters and how it may change President Trump's mind on tariffs.\nWhen a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - known as \"Treasuries\" in the US -  to investors on financial markets.\nSuch payments are made over a number of pre-agreed years before a full and final payment is made when the bond \"matures\" - in other words, expires. \nInvestors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks like the Bank of England.\nInvestors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.\nSo when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds. \nBut recently that hasn't happened.\nInitially, following the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds. \nHowever, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend, investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.\nThe so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.\nWhy the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them. \nThe higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.\nIf the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself. \nBut it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.\nJohn Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.\nBusinesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.\nMr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.\nFirst-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.\nFollowing the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to \"hang tough\", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.\nFollowing the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.\nIt proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.\n\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.\nAccording to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump. \nThe bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.\nSome analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.\nWhile bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.\n\"Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,\" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.\nBut unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.\nSince 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.\nJapan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally. \nQuestions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.\nHowever, this is unlikely as any fire sale \"would impoverish China more than it would hurt the US\", according to Capital Economics.",

I think I was 3-0 up and then I didn't pot a ball for three or four frames. Some of the balls he potted were incredible,\" Williams told BBC Sport. \n\"He's got the potential to win this tournament, there's absolutely no question.

With this coaching certificate, I want to be able to get a job.\"\nListen to Africa Daily: Can football help women prisoners get back on their feet?\nAbout 80 women and their children are currently housed at the Freetown Female Correctional Centre according to AdvocAid, a non-governmental organisation in the West African country.\nBut it is not just prisoners in Sierra Leone who have benefited from the Caf course.\nIt has also been held in Ghana, is under way in Liberia and there are plans to extend the scheme to other parts of the continent.\nIsha Johansen, former president of the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA), pioneered the project after a visit to the correctional facility in Freetown.\n\"I saw very young girls there, an inmate with a baby on her lap and another pregnant,\" she told the BBC.\n\"90% of those inmates were in there because of poverty or petty crimes. They had no business being there.\n\"They are spending five, six or eight years doing nothing.\n\"I had to make a change. I was compelled to do something and football was a massive tool I had at my disposal.\"\nInmates received their coaching qualifications at the end of the course - but their anonymity was ensured by Sierra Leonean prison authorities\nWith few facilities at Freetown's correctional centre, the first course was run on the Astroturf pitch at the SLFA academy in the city.\nThe country's governing body also provided the inmates with equipment and jerseys.\nHowever, Johansen said the prison will now be investing in its own football pitch \"in the next few months\".\nFor those not keen on issuing instructions on the touchline, the Caf programme also offers other ways for inmates to get involved.\nSome are now sewing jerseys and training bibs for clubs across the country.\n\"What I'd like to see is when these girls go back into society, they don't end up back in prison,\" Johansen said.\n\"When they come out, they've got skills. They can go to the football federation to look for a job and they can coach in schools.\"\nMeanwhile, inmates in Nsawam - the largest female prison in Ghana with a population of 115 - also took to the football pitch in February.\nThe facility, located just to the north of the capital Accra, houses just over half of the country's female convicts.\nFormer Uganda international Majidah Nantanda offered instruction to inmates in Sierra Leone\n\"Being in prison here is very complicated for us,\" said one prisoner involved in the scheme in Nsawam.\n\"We are controlled on everything. It gives us a headache.\n\"But coaching is my passion, so when we heard about the course I was so happy to be part of it.\n\"We have learnt a lot of skills, like dribbling techniques.\"\nFormer Ghana international Mercy Tagoe, who represented her country at the 1999 Women's World Cup and has also coached the Black Queens, was among the instructors when the Caf course was run in Nsawam.\nShe stresses how it can help inmates back into society.\n\"They can do something with this license. Once they leave prison they can start with the grassroots within their local area,\" Tagoe said.\n\"They go to prison to be reformed. So this course can help them move on with their lives.\"\nBack in Freetown, Johansen is working with Caf and world governing body Fifa to see how the scheme can be implemented in other African countries - but also further afield in Asia and South America.\nFootball, she believes, has the power the change the lives of young women in similar circumstances across the globe.\n\"It's about using football for positive social change,\" Johansen said.\n\"Football is so much more than just 90 minutes on the pitch. This is an example of that.\"",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer.\nThe controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen.\nIn the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages.\n\"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\"\nWhite House officials have played down the reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it.\nTrump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary.\n\"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media. That's an old one. Try finding something new,\" he said. \nTrump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea that was also floated by Hegseth himself earlier Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\".\nHegseth did not directly respond to the story about the second Signal chat, which was initially reported by the New York Times.\nIn a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared.\nThe messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. \nHegseth's wife, Jennifer, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans.\nUnlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times.\nThe existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. \nOfficials used the group to discuss information relating to upcoming strikes in Yemen. Goldberg left the original chat after the first attacks on 14 March, but the two group chats appeared to discuss the same military operation that took place over several weeks.\nThe White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, although critics of Hegseth - including former US defence officials - question that. They say discussing such information in Signal groups could jeopardise US personnel carrying out military operations.\nSignal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only the sender of the message and its recipients can view its contents. \nThis is considered a high level of security for a messaging app. But it offers no protection if someone's phone is viewed by another person or falls into the wrong hands, or if the wrong person is added to a group chat.\nExperts say this is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on officials' private devices.\nThe existence of the second Signal group is the latest controversy surrounding the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (\u00a3670bn).\nHegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\".\nIn a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired.\n\"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. \nHegseth denounced the reporters, and said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\" before turning away from the cameras. \nIn an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, a former top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\".\nHe added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\"\nUllyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\"\nHowever, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, accused the \"Trump-hating media\" of \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\".\nHe echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\".\nWashington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.\nThe Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nUS air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The Houthi-led government said the attack constituted a \"war crime\".",

        "article_text": "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.\n\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.\nLucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.\nLucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.\nThe condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.\nLucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.\nThe abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.\n\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.\nThis is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.\nWithout medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.\nShe pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"\nAnd that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.\nIt is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.\nIn 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.\nIt is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.\n\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\" \nLucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.\nShe says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.\n\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"\nIP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.\n\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"\nIn response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.\nBut Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.\n\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.\n\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"\n\nLucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.\nNHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.\n\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"\nHer health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.\n\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"\nOnce she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.\nShe will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.\nOver a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.\nMeanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.\nThe embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.\nLucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.\n\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"\nA few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.\n\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.\n\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"\nYou can listen to Lucy Edwards on BBC Access All on BBC Sounds.

        "article_text": "The cover of a book held at a Suffolk museum was recently found to be made from the skin of a man hanged for a notorious murder almost 200 years ago.\nWilliam Corder was convicted of killing a woman in 1827, which shocked Georgian Britain and became known as the Red Barn Murder.\nCurators at Moyse's Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds realised the book, which was on a bookshelf in an office, had been overlooked but it has now gone on display.\nIt had been donated decades ago by a family with close connections to the surgeon who anatomised Corder's body.\nSo what do we know of William Corder and the murder, which fascinates to this day?\nWilliam was from a middle-class family of tenant farmers in the village of Polstead, between Ipswich and Sudbury, at the turn of the 19th Century. \nAt the age of 22, when he and Maria Marten became lovers, he was the head of the Corder family and had a reputation as a ladies' man. Maria, who was 24 and lived at home with her mole-catcher father, a stepmother, sister, and her young son, may have seen young William as a means of escape.\nIn 1827, William came up with a plan to elope, telling Maria to meet him at the Red Barn on the Corder's farm, then run off to Ipswich to get the banns for their wedding. \nMaria was not seen again and William disappeared.\nWilliam eventually left Suffolk and wrote to the Marten family to say he had eloped with Maria to the Isle of Wight.\nIn reality, he was holed up just outside London and Maria was buried at the lovers' rendezvous, having been shot in the neck.\nAlmost a year later, legend states, Ann Marten had a dream her stepdaughter was dead and at the Red Barn. Maria's father dug with his \"mole spud\" spade and found his daughter's remains.\nAs a manhunt ensued, a newspaper editor flagged that he knew of a William Corder.\n\"He is effectively on the run, and the theory is he's lonely, and puts an advert in the newspaper asking for a new wife,\" says Dan Clarke, a heritage officer at Moyse's Hall Museum. It holds many Red Barn Murder artefacts, including two books covered in Corder's skin.\nThe authorities traced Corder, who denies any knowledge of Maria, but has a letter from Polstead telling him her body has been found.\nCorder was brought to Bury St Edmunds on 10 counts of murder, each based on a different theory about Maria's demise and to strengthen the chance of a conviction.\nIn his defence he claimed Maria had killed herself, thereby accusing the dead woman of a capital crime. He was found guilty after a two-day trial, and in a final confession said he had accidentally shot Maria during an argument.\nIt is estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people came to see him hanged outside the prison at the stroke of noon on 11 August 1828. Later that day, people queued to file past his body at the town's Shire Hall. \n\"There were so many people, the story goes they couldn't get him outside the prison, so they had to hit a hole in the side of the building and create a temporary scaffold,\" said Mr Clarke.\n\"There would have been singing and dancing, you would have been able  to buy a section of the rope afterwards.\"\nPolstead became a tourist attraction, the Red Barn and even Maria's gravestone chipped away by souvenir-hunters.\nPublic intrigue in the Red Barn Murder sparked books, plays and music, and it permeates the true crime culture to this day.\nAt a distance of two centuries, it has become a ripping yarn, the true story clouded in legend.\nIt is probably fuelled, in part, by being able to stand face-to-face with Corder's image, his eyes shut and his nostrils flared. His death mask is held at Moyse Hall and Norwich Castle.\nFor many years, until it eventually began to fall apart, his skeleton was used to teach medical students at West Suffolk Hospital.\nDisturbingly, two books were covered in his skin and part of the man's scalp, with ear included, was kept as a gruesome ornament. All are at Moyse Hall.\nTerry Deary, who created Horrible Histories, believes Corder has been \"maligned\" with Maria incorrectly portrayed as an innocent young maiden.\nMoyse's Hall said it would redress the focus on Corder with a future exhibition which will shine a light on woman victims in Suffolk history, including Maria. \nHeritage assistant Abbie Smith said 80% of its visitors were \"desperate\" to know about the Red Barn Murder.\n\"How it ended is a big factor, it was such a spectacle and people are going to be drawn to it.\n\"It's a gory, grotty one, so people seem to like that - rather worryingly.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "The Everglades' eclectic alligators are surprisingly diverse builders, bodyguards, commuters, and health-bringing engineers.\nFrom the edge of the Miccosukee Indian Reservation, in the north of the Florida Everglades, it is a short fan-boat ride through grassy swamp to get to an island that 18-year-old Hector Tigertail's family visit each year. For decades, this family \"hammock\" \u2013 as the tree-covered islands that poke out from the Everglades are known \u2013 has been their retreat; a place where the family can camp, cook and hunt. But they share this particular island with at least one permanent resident: an American alligator that, at around 7ft (2.1m) from nose to tail, is the largest female he's ever seen.\u00a0\nTigertail's family, members of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and this powerful reptile, which locals refer to as Mama Gator, have lived side by side for much of the 60-year-old animal's life, he explains. This intimate coexistence provides a chance to observe how alligators meticulously shape their surroundings. Through the dry season between December and May, she excavates a \"gator pond\" with her snout, claws and tail, a depression where water pools and she can wallow, keep cool and mate. At the start of the rainy season (from June to November), she builds a raised nest for her clutch of eggs, from mud, grass and twigs \u2013 a time when the humans know to keep a respectful distance from the protective mother. In return, for the next few years, they are often rewarded with the sight of Mama and her baby gators in tow.\u00a0\n\"We like to call her Mama Gator because she's everybody's grandma,\" says Tigertail.\nIn recent years, scientific research is adding support to something Florida's Miccosukee Tribe have long known: alligators like Mama play vital roles as \"guardians of the Everglades\" and engineer their environment in ways that protect freshwater ecosystems. Alligators carry around nutrients that feed ecosystem webs, and their ponds and nests provide refuges where plants, fish\u00a0and frogs live. New data hints that that alligators may also benefit us.\n\"Apex predator or not, alligators are actually very helpful and they can change the ecosystem significantly,\" says Tigertail, who researches alligators for the Miccosukee Tribe's Fish and Wildlife Department. \"During the dry season, a lot of animals \u2013\u00a0 deer, fish, otters, turtles, birds \u2013\u00a0 follow the alligators.\"\nFor those like biologist Christopher Murray who has spent decades closely studying alligators, it's high time to move past their reputation as cold-hearted killers and recognise the varied roles they're playing as caring and constructive ecosystem engineers. While the cute, herbivorous beaver is widely celebrated for stewarding temperate wetlands, it is the \"gnarly swamp monsters\" who deserve plaudits in the southeastern United States and many other places, says Murray, associate professor at Southeastern Louisiana University. \"I think we're just beginning to understand that crocodilians, in general, and specifically alligators, do a lot more good than we think.\"\u00a0\nAlligators are often called \"living fossils\", relatively untouched by major evolutionary changes for at least eight million years, with remarkably similar ancestors already hunting swamps alongside the dinosaurs. Yet, beginning in the 1850s, the arrival of rifle-wielding European settlers into the wetlands of Florida and Louisiana drove this evolutionary line to the verge of extinction.\u00a0\nMore than 10 million alligators were killed by commercial hunting up to the 1960s, driven by the popularity of their hides for bags, belts and boots, with others shot for sport or \"just for fun\" according to historical accounts. In 1967, American alligators were placed on endangered species lists, leading to nationwide hunting bans that allowed populations to recover. Today, the species is recognised as a standout conservation success story, as the population has rebounded to more than three million alligators estimated to live in the wild in the states of Florida and Louisiana, and thousands more spread across the south-eastern United States.\nJust as conservationists began fighting to save the species from extinction in the 1960s and 1970s, researchers began documenting their important ecological roles. In the wet season, the raised ridges around the edge of these nests are relatively dry land where some plants can escape flooding and provide platforms where smaller reptiles build their own nests. Meanwhile wading birds build their own nests above alligators, which act as \"bodyguards\", keeping raccoons and other predators away from the birds' eggs. (More recent research has shown that this is a macabre but overall mutually beneficial arrangement with alligators being rewarded with snacks from chicks that fall from the nests.)\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nMike Heithaus, professor of biological sciences at Florida International University, explains that, despite its lush appearances, the Everglades can be a nutrient poor environment. A largely flat wetland, dominated by grass-like plants, many key nutrients are carried out to sea by great slow-flowing seasonal rivers, some kilometres wide.\u00a0\nIn the dry season, when the water level falls, research since the mid-20th Century has shown that alligators' habit of excavating holes created variety in the otherwise monotonous landscape, with unique communities of plants, animals and algae around ponds. These holes can be architecturally diverse \u2013 created by one alligator or up to a dozen together \u2013 incorporating eclectic \"burrows and hidey-holes\", says Heithaus, including underwater caverns, where the alligator can stay submerged for hours. These aquatic environments form refuges in which fish like juvenile largemouth bass survive the dry season but can also be \"death traps\" which lure birds in search of a snack, he adds.\u00a0\nWe're now learning these are surprisingly dynamic systems. Research in 2023 showed that it was not only the construction of the ponds that counted \"but actively being in the pond matters\", says Heithaus. As the alligators move, they continually stir up the sediment to keep those nutrients in the water. \"The alligators are moving around; they're pooping in there. That's providing nutrients which algae \u2013 that form the base of the food web \u2013 rely on. So, you kind of prime the pump: you feed the bottom of the food chain and [the nutrients] come all the way up.\"\u00a0\nWithout alligators, there would be much less nutrients circulated in the water, says Heithaus. \"You put alligators there, and you get food and water, and that's happy times for most critters in the Everglades.\"\nThis research also reveals a lesser-seen side of alligators, spotlighting them as remarkably sophisticated and adaptable creatures. The alligator's reputation as a \"man-eating monster\" was inspired long ago by accounts like William Bartram's widely reproduced (and wildly inaccurate) stories of encountering alligators in Florida swamps with \"clouds of smoke\" erupting from their nostrils. Although attacks on humans are very rare, these cold-blooded animals remain feared by many as killers or \"weird swamp things\", says Murray, who has worked with alligators for more than two decades.\nThose who live up close with alligators see other qualities. One alligator in the state of Georgia, named Wally, was even docile enough to be domesticated as an \"emotional support alligator\", providing comfort and \"hugs\" to help alleviate his owner's depression.\u00a0\nDespite the reported gentleness of some individuals, it is recommended to stay at least 9m (30ft) away from alligators in the wild. Alligators are carnivores, powerful enough to bring down a wild deer or feral boar but \"naturally they're going to be more of a flighty, non-confrontational animal,\" says Kendall Osceola, who worked at the Miccosukee Indian Village, the tribe's cultural centre. The Miccosukee learn a strict set of rules from a young age for sharing their coastal homes with gators. \"We were always told if there's a body of water in Florida, there's going to be an alligator in there. So, keep a careful eye on any pets or anything small around the water line,\" she says. Yet Miccosukee stories depict them as \"benevolent creatures\", she says.\nMore like this:\n\n\u2022\u00a0How do you re-home a rhino? Upside down\n\u2022\u00a0Elephants hate bees - here's how that helps humans\n\u2022\u00a0A wild\u00a0'freakosystem' has been born in Hawaii\nToday, alligators have adapted to live in the urbanised environments of golf courses, canals and sewers. Researchers have been surprised by how varied and flexible alligators are, explains Heithaus, yet research in 2011 found behaviours that have shocked even those who study them. Near Miccosukee village, in an area where alligators live in mangrove forests alongside a fast-flowing river, Heithaus and Adam Rosenblatt fitted trackers to alligators, finding that similar alligators lived very different lives \u2013 some were \"couch potatoes\" who remain close to home, while others were \"commuters\" who travel long distances to coastal areas. \"Tag two alligators \u2013 same size, both males, 20m (65.6ft) apart on the shore \u2013 and one will not move more than 7km (4.3 miles) in total in three months, and the other might do 800km (497 miles),\" says Heithaus.\nWhile American alligators have been spotted swimming out in the ocean in the past, prior to this research this behaviour was believed to be extremely rare, says Heithaus. Unlike crocodiles, alligators lack specialised glands to process salt, yet this monitoring showed that some alligators frequently venture out into the ocean when there are abundant saltwater fish and crabs to feast on. \"When we first got some data suggesting the alligators were down in these saltwater environments for maybe 18 hours at a time, we were looked at like we had two heads \u2013 people didn't believe it at all,\" says Heithaus. \"And I think it's one of the cool things we're finding across sharks, alligators, and lots of animals \u2013 that there's a lot more behavioural adaptability and individual specialisation than we would have thought \u2013 bold individuals, shy individuals; exploratory individuals, stay-at-home individuals.\"\nHeithaus is aiming to figure out what causes these different behaviours \u2013 whether genetic or influenced by environmental factors \u2013 as well as what role \"commuting\" plays in cycling nutrients around wetland environments. Already, studies have shown that alligator ponds are richer in key nutrients like phosphorus and commuters are carrying nutrients up into the wetlands from coastal areas, by eating in the oceans and excreting upstream. \"We know that they're moving these nutrients upstream,\" says Heithaus. His team at the Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research Program is seeking a more granular understanding of how this affects the overall \"nutrient budget\" of the ecosystem, where nutrients are deposited, and how it affects the overall system.\nCrucially, at a time when the Gulf Coast is being hard hit by the impacts of climate change, we are also learning that alligators may affect their environments' ability to capture carbon. By analysing soil samples across Louisiana, Murray was recently able to demonstrate in a study that areas with high numbers of alligators are rich carbon stores. \"What this paper says to me is: look, we rescued the American alligator from extinction,\" he says, \"but what we didn't realise, back then, was that maybe we were actually doing a lot more for the environment \u2013 in the context of carbon sequestration and the battle against climate change \u2013 than we previously thought.\"\nThe next step, says Murray, is to show that alligators are actively contributing to higher carbon storage in these areas \u2013 and how. We have good reason to think alligators, as apex predators, may be playing a similar \"top-down\" role to the famed wolves of Yellowstone, whose return has reduced herbivore grazing on small trees and helped forests to regrow. The theory of trophic cascades developed by Utah State University ecologist Trisha Atwood has shown that apex predators are not only vital for ecosystem health but could have big impacts on CO2 dynamics. This could be particularly important in freshwater ecosystems like Louisiana's tidally inundated wetlands, which store enormous amounts of carbon, says Murray, but can turn into a carbon source when they dry out.\nMurray hopes his forthcoming research can provide further evidence about the value of supporting healthy alligator populations. Although hunting bans were the most important step to save the species from extinction, efforts to protect and restore populations are ongoing and involve groups who are often less recognised, he says. Among them are commercial alligator ranchers who retrieve eggs from the wild, incubate them and raise them through the first few years of life in enclosed or semi-wild environments, safeguarding them when they are most vulnerable to predation and disease. This form of early-years care, known as \"head-starting\", is common in conservation initiatives that aim to help endangered animals \u2013 from Eastern indigo snakes to burrowing owls. But, in Louisiana, this is a \"self-funded\" system driven by ranchers, says Murray. These ranchers are required to release 5% of alligators they raise into the wild, while the rest are treated as livestock that can be butchered for meat and hides.\u00a0\nIn the Everglades, head-starting is also carried out by the Miccosukee, who rescue eggs in years when water levels in the Everglades rise, threatening to drown eggs, or temperatures fall to levels that can harm baby alligators. \"Sometimes I would be at home and my uncle would tell me: 'Hey, the temperature is dropping really fast. It's going to be a really cold night. So get on the airboat and we have to go out there before the cold weather kills them',\" says Tigertail.\nDespite their fearsome reputation, all this hints at a future where humans and alligators coexist, with these reptiles recognised as \"helpful participants\" in solutions to the challenges we both face, says Murray. \"If you think historically, alligators and other crocodilians have been revered as a sacred entity in cultures around the world. Do they command respect? Yes. But are they monsters? Are they to be feared? No.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Camden is such a busy, bustling part of the capital and I couldn't understand why,\" Ms Davis said.\n\"I thought the theatre needed to do something about it.\n\"There's lots of brilliant theatres doing this kind of work, and for me, theatre has always offered a community, a home, and I wanted to open up Hampstead to the Camden community.\"\nShe added: \"Whether you're on the stage, whether you're writing a play or performing in it, or watching it, it is a communal experience.\n\"It's where conversations can be sparked and bonds are built -  I just thought we were the perfect place to be doing this kind of work.\"\nMs Davis said the theatre had worked on the project with Age UK Camden, Wac Arts and the Winch - local charities that support people in the borough.\n\"Theatre is such a brilliant way of sharing, exploring your identity, meeting new people and building bonds,\" she added.\nProfessor Jason Arday, who has a Radio 4 programme called A Lonely Life, said loneliness was \"becoming part of the general zeitgeist\".\n\"We are living in a more lonely society for lots of different reasons,\" he said. \"Division plays a big part of that, the turbulence and the stresses of life, I think people are finding it harder.\"\nProfessor Arday said small interventions, such as the project by Hampstead Theatre, were \"hugely impactful\".\n\"Importantly, it does set a premise for best practice, in terms of what other communities can engage in across the nation,\" he said.\n\"You probably couldn't think of many better instruments than the arts.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The cardinal will remain in the position during the \"Apostolica Sedes Vacans\", the period between the death or resignation of a pope until the election of the next pontiff. \nHe also will play an important role in the centuries-old ceremonies to mourn Pope Francis. \nBorn in 1947 in Dublin, Farrell attended the University of Salamanca in Spain and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, according to the Vatican.\nHe held roles in churches around the world, serving as a chaplain at the University of Monterrey in Mexico as well as at a parish in Bethesda, Maryland. \nAll told, the 77-year-old spent more than 30 years working for churches in the US. \nFarrell was appointed Bishop of Dallas in 2007 until Pope Francis asked him in 2016 to serve as the leader of the Vatican's new department responsible for the pastoral care of families, raising him to the rank of cardinal.\nYears after naming him as camerlengo, in 2023, Francis chose Farrell as president of the Supreme Court of Vatican City State. He was also named president of the Commission for Confidential Matters.\nAs camerlengo, Cardinal Farrell will be tasked with making arrangements for the conclave, the process through which the next pontiff is selected. \nTechnically, a camerlengo can become pope, as has happened twice in history: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939.\nThe cardinal also will preside over the certification of Francis's death, laying his body into the coffin. After that, the cardinal is expected to lead a procession moving the pope's body from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta to St Peter's Basilica. \nThe ceremony could take place as soon as Wednesday morning, according to the Vatican.\nYou can get in touch by following this link",

Guardiola was not among them. He shook his head, ranted at his coaches on the bench, then launched a tirade towards the nearby fourth official.\nGuardiola was booked for his emotive reaction but he felt wronged. He was still shaking his head forcefully, his face set like stone, as the replay was shown on the big screen at the exact moment he returned to his seat after half-time.\nThen there was a demand for more noise, gesturing to all parts of the ground for City's fans to turn up the volume, and a familiar sink to the knees as James McAtee's delicate lob dropped just the wrong side of the post.\nFinally there was the tension release of Matheus Nunes' injury-time winner. Guardiola reacted as though he had scored himself, acknowledging the noise from the fans he wanted more from earlier.\nThere was a storming of the pitch as the whistle blew, a hug - tight - for Nunes, a laugh and a joke with Kevin de Bruyne, who at the weekend revealed his manager had not even made an offer for him to stay at the end of the season.\nMake no mistake, this win was big.\n\"You don't have to be a scientist to realise that we were playing against Aston Villa, one of the best teams, as you saw against Newcastle and PSG,\" said Guardiola.\n\"They are an extraordinary team but we performed as we did in the past with the commitment.\n\"Qualification for the Champions League is important, of course, but sometimes we have to be calm. We must focus on the semi-final and after we have days to prepare for the four 'finals'. Two at home, two away.\"\nBy that, Guardiola means Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, and then back to the Premier League for key games against Wolves and relegated Southampton before the final two - Bournemouth at home, Fulham away - interspersed, he hopes, with another trip to Wembley.\nFour points separate five teams - who will prosper in race for Europe?\nNunes sends Man City third with late winner against Villa\nManchester City fans have been protesting against ticket prices\nIn Guardiola's mind, it is all so clear.\nIt is why detached observers are led to the conclusion City's football is regimented.\nYet, the reality is Guardiola is making subtle tweaks as the season goes on.\nHe accepts what he has now is not what even he expected when the campaign began, when Rodri and Erling Haaland were available, not on the bench as they were again against Villa due to injury.\nNo-one would have predicted Saturday's hero at Everton would be 20-year-old Nico O'Reilly, making his fourth league start. Against Villa it would be Nunes, signed from Wolves for \u00a353m in September 2023 when a plan to bring in Lucas Paqueta from West Ham had to be aborted, who turned into a right-back rather than his central midfield scheming role.\n\"If you told me at the beginning of the season that at the end of it we would be fighting for the FA Cup final or to qualify for the Champions League with Nico and Matheus at full-back, I'd say: 'What are you talking about?'\" said Guardiola.\n\"Matheus is a person that is incredibly loved. When you talk with the journalists he's always so serious but in the locker room he's always laughing.\n\"He has physicality for when he has to run and sustain the wingers. Step by step he has been so important.\"\nIt's another puzzle solved for Guardiola. Another solution found.\nIt will be fascinating now to see if City can keep alive their hopes of domestic silverware alive.\nThey have failed to win at least one trophy only three times since they won the FA Cup in 2011 to end their long wait for success.\nSince Guardiola's first season in 2016-17, City have always won at least one of the three domestic competitions on offer.\nIn theory, the supporters have never had it so good.\nBut many are not happy. Protests against ticket prices took place again before kick-off.\nThose running the club argue the finance generated allows Guardiola to have the squad he demands. The fans do not agree - and Guardiola agrees with them.\n\"I am on the side of the people,\" he said. \"I'm a supporter for Manchester City as well.\n\"I don't have to pay [for] the tickets but I understand the feeling.\n\"When I go to the theatre or to a concert and I pay for the ticket, I want to see something I like.\n\"We want them here and we want a full stadium every time.\"\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "In April 1983, a German magazine, Stern, and a British newspaper, The Sunday Times, claimed to have made one of the century's most extraordinary historical discoveries. In fact, it was one of the century's most extraordinary hoaxes \u2013 and the scandal that followed cost millions and ruined reputations.\nOn 25 April 1983, 42 years ago this week, respected German magazine Stern published what they believed to be the most spectacular historical scoop: the previously unknown private diaries of Adolf Hitler. To show off their extraordinary exclusive to the world's press, the weekly news magazine had arranged a Hamburg press conference for the same day. The story would indeed dominate global headlines \u2013 but not in the way the magazine hoped.\nThree days earlier, Stern's London editor Peter Wickman had told BBC News that they were \"absolutely convinced\" that they had the authentic Hitler diaries in their hands. \"We were very dubious at the beginning, but we had a graphologist looking at them, we had an expert who compared the paper. We had historians like Professor Trevor-Roper, and they are all convinced they are genuine.\"\nThe handwritten journals ran from 1932 to 1945, covering the entire period of Hitler's Third Reich. \"There are 60 diaries, they look a bit like school exercise books but with a hard cover. They have seals outside with a swastika and an eagle and inside, of course, Hitler's very spidery gothic handwriting,\" Wickman told the BBC.\nStern believed that their discovery had the potential to rewrite what was previously known about the Nazi leader. And the diaries' content was certainly eye-opening, revealing a little-known sensitive side to the F\u00fchrer. They detailed everything from Hitler's battles with flatulence and halitosis, and the pressure from his girlfriend Eva Braun to get Olympics tickets, to notes about sending Stalin \u2013 \"the old fox\" \u2013 a birthday telegram. The notebooks also seemed to indicate, somewhat startlingly, that the Nazi leader was unaware of the Holocaust that was being carried out in his name.\u00a0\nThe journals had supposedly been unearthed by Stern journalist Gerd Heidemann. The reporter was already regarded around Stern as something of a Nazi memorabilia obsessive. In 1973, the magazine had assigned him to write a story about a dilapidated yacht which had once belonged to Hitler's second-in-command, Hermann G\u00f6ring. Heidemann spent a fortune buying the yacht and restoring it. He also began an affair with G\u00f6ring's daughter Edda, who introduced him to a number of former Nazis. It was through these contacts, Heidemann said, that he had come across Hitler's diaries.\nHeidemann claimed that the plane had been carrying the diaries, which were salvaged from the crash and stowed away in a hayloft. In the intervening years, they had found their way to an East German collector who was now offering to sell them. The reporter would negotiate the deal to buy them, acting as intermediary between his East German source and Stern.\nThe promise of a sensational world exclusive, providing previously unknown insight into the mind of the Nazi dictator, proved irresistible to the magazine. But Stern was determined to keep a tight grip on who knew about their scoop, so when they hired handwriting experts to authenticate the diaries \u2013 providing them with \"genuine\" Hitler documents for comparison \u2013 they would only give them a few selected pages of the notebooks to look at. Stern ultimately forked out some 9.3 million Deutschmarks (\u00a32.3m) for the volumes, and, having paid such an exorbitant sum, opted to store them in a Swiss vault for safekeeping.\nThe first historian to examine the diaries was Prof Hugh Trevor-Roper, also known as Lord Dacre of Glanton. In 1947, he had written a book, The Last Days of Hitler, which had brought him a great deal of academic prestige, and he was regarded as a leading expert on the Nazi dictator. He was also an independent director of The Times newspaper, which two years earlier had been acquired along with its sister paper, The Sunday Times, by Rupert Murdoch.\nLord Dacre was initially sceptical about the diaries, but flew to Switzerland to view them. His opinion began to be swayed when he heard the diaries' origin story and was told, erroneously, that chemical tests had found them to be pre-war. But what really tipped the balance for the historian was seeing the huge volume of material involved.\u00a0\n\"The thing that struck Hugh Trevor-Roper most forcefully and certainly struck me as a non-expert when I saw the original material was the sheer scale of it,\" The Times editor Charles Douglas-Home told the BBC on 22 April 1983. \"The enormous range of this archive. It's not just that there are nearly 60 volumes of notebooks filled out in Hitler's longhand which is there, there are about 300 of his drawings and pictures and personal documents such as his party card. I remember there are the drawings which he submitted to art school when he was a young man hoping to get into art school, and there is a painting, an oil painting and so on. Now a forger would have to be very good to forge across that whole range.\"\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\u00a0\nLord Dacre became convinced that the journals were genuine, even writing an article for The Times vouching for their authenticity and declaring that historic events might need to be re-evaluated in light of them. As word got out about the Hitler diaries, a bidding war developed over their serialisation rights, with The Sunday Times proprietor, Murdoch, flying over to Zurich to negotiate a deal in person.\nWith serialisation deals signed, Stern hastily planned a press conference to announce the publication of Hitler's diaries to the world. But even before the notebooks' grand reveal, doubts were being raised about their veracity \u2013 not least by the staff of The Sunday Times themselves, who had been burnt before. In 1968, the newspaper had made a down payment on diaries supposedly written by the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, which had also been vouched for, by his son no less. \"But they turned out to be fakes devised by two little old ladies who lived in Vercelli outside Milan,\" journalist Phillip Knightley, who worked for The Sunday Times's investigative team, told Witness History in 2011.\nHowever, Murdoch was certain about the diaries and, despite the reservations of its editor, Frank Giles, rushed the serialisation into print in The Sunday Times with the headline \"world exclusive\" the day before Stern's press announcement.\nGiles rang Lord Dacre seeking reassurance about the story only to have the historian confess that he was not so much having doubts as making \"a 180-degree turn\" regarding the diaries' authenticity. \"Everybody in the room, all the newspaper executives slumped down in their chairs and put their heads in their hands because we had lost our principal authenticator,\" said Knightley. \"It was clear that the story was absolutely wrong.\"\nThe Sunday Times could still have stopped the presses and changed the front page. But when Giles rang the proprietor, \"Murdoch said, 'Just because Dacre has been vacillating for all this time, screw him, we'll publish,'\" recalls Knightley.\nFor Stern, things would just get worse at its\u00a0news conference\u00a0the next day. After editor-in-chief Peter Koch declared that he was \"100% convinced that Hitler wrote every single word in those books\", Lord Dacre, the very historian who had vouched they were the real deal, admitted under questioning that he was having second thoughts.\nTo the horrified looks of the Stern executives, Lord Dacre said that he wasn't able to establish a link between the plane crash and the alleged diaries and that he had been rushed into making a judgement. \"I must say as a historian, I regret that the normal methods of historical verification have, perhaps necessarily, been to some extent sacrificed to the requirements of the journalistic scoop,\" he said.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The true story of The Great Escape\n\u2022 The British politician who faked his own death\n\u2022 How Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jewish people in WW2\nThe day after the chaotic press conference, Charles Hamilton, a US autographs dealer, told BBC Breakfast that as soon he saw the diaries' pages he \"could smell the ebullient odour of forgeries\". Hamilton said that he knew the signature wasn't authentic because he was constantly offered fake Hitler documents. \"Shortly it will be established without any question, and without any panel of experts which I think is superfluous at the present time, the whole affair will die down and it will be a great hoax in the history of mankind,\" he said.\nAnd he was not wrong. Within two weeks, rigorous forensic analysis had exposed the diaries as fakes. Not only, as Hamilton had pointed out to the BBC, was Hitler's supposed signature not accurate, but chemical testing revealed that their paper, glue and ink were not manufactured until after World War Two. The diaries were peppered with errors, modern-day phrases and historical inaccuracies, sometimes referring to information that Hitler could not have possibly known.\nIn the wake of these revelations The Sunday Times quickly abandoned its serialisation and printed an apology. Stern also publicly apologised for having fallen for the hoax.\nUnder pressure, Heidemann revealed that the East German source supplying the diaries was Konrad Kujau \u2013 a counterfeiter who turned out to be the author of the works. Kujau was a skilled artist, but his forgeries were far from sophisticated. Seeking inspiration, he had plagiarised large parts of Max Domarus's book Hitler: Speeches and Proclamations 1932-1945, and as a result had copied word for word some of the chronological and factual mistakes in that book's first edition. To try to give the journals a more personal feel, he had imagined a more prosaic side to the F\u00fchrer's life, throwing in entries like \"I can't even get off work and visit Eva\", \"Have to go to the post office, to send a few telegrams\", and \"Eva says I have bad breath\". Kujau had even struggled with the elaborate Gothic initials he used on the diary covers, accidentally sticking the initials FH to them instead of AH. He had then attempted to age the notebooks by merely pouring tea over them and bashing them on his desk.\u00a0\nWhat helped with the initial authentication of the diaries was that Kujau was such a prolific forger of Nazi memorabilia that many of the \"genuine\" documents Stern had given to experts, to enable them to compare Hitler's handwriting, had actually also been produced by Kujau himself. He was arrested by the police and admitted to his role in the hoax. He even went so far as to demonstrate his guilt by writing his confession in the style of Hitler's handwriting. In 1985, he was found guilty of fraud and forgery and sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison.\u00a0\nOn further investigation, the police found Heidemann had also inflated the prices he said his source was requesting for the diaries, and had been skimming money off the top of the sums paid by Stern. He seems to have done this to fund his lavish lifestyle, the upkeep of his Nazi yacht and his penchant for buying ever more dictators' memorabilia (he would later claim to possess Idi Amin's underwear). He, like Kujau, was convicted in 1985 of fraud and was sentenced to four years, eight months. At his trial, Heidemann maintained that he too had been duped, but Kujau always insisted that the reporter knew the diaries were fakes.\u00a0\nIn the fallout from the scandal, Lord Dacre's reputation as a historian would be permanently tarnished. Koch and another of Stern's editors would lose their jobs, while Giles would be removed from his role as The Sunday Times editor. Even Murdoch would later claim to the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in 2012 that his decision to run with the story \"was a major mistake I made, I take full responsibility for it. I will have to live with it for the rest of my life.\"\nHowever, his newspaper's circulation was boosted by his decision to print the false story. And since Murdoch had insisted on a clause that Stern return all the money paid to it by The Sunday Times if the diaries were shown to be fake, the media mogul would only profit financially from the hoax.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The footage also showed several other vehicles, including an ambulance, passed by in the hour or so between the first and second Israeli attack, without being shot at. \nIsraeli officials said this proved troops in Gaza did not open fire on medical vehicles unless they felt threatened.\nA UN official in Gaza suggested the IDF investigation did not go far enough. \"A lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place,\" said Jonathan Whittall. \n\"Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all, eroding.\"\nIsrael originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached \"suspiciously\" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army.\nBut it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of a medic who was killed showed the vehicles with their lights on and their emergency signals flashing.\nThe footage shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when shooting begins just before dawn.\nThe video continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles.\nIt also shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wearing reflective hi-vis uniform.\nThe bodies of the 15 dead workers were buried in sand. They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.\nThe IDF also confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic it had detained following the incident. They did not confirm his name, but the International Committee of the Red Cross has previously named him as Assad al-Nassasra. \nThe Red Crescent and several other international organisations have previously called for an independent investigation into the incident.\nThe IDF's decision to fire a commander and discipline another senior officer is not unheard of - the military dismissed two officers and took action against others after seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen were killed in April of last year.\nIsrael launched its first major operation in Rafah in May 2024, leaving large parts of it in ruins. Tens of thousands of people returned to what was left of their homes in the city during a recent two-month-long ceasefire.\nIsrael renewed its offensive in Gaza on 18 March after the first phase of the ceasefire deal came to an end and negotiations on a second phase of the deal stalled.\nIsrael launched its campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 51,201 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions.

This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "It may be set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but Tony Gilroy's Star Wars series takes a key plot from a real robbery masterminded by Stalin in an Imperial Russian city. And Andor has as much to do with our world as it has with Stalin's.\nIt has all the makings of the perfect heist.\nThe scheme takes place far from the imperial seat of power, on the wild fringes of an empire almost too vast to comprehend. Fuelled with revolutionary zeal, the plotters are a rag-tag outfit of men and women that includes thieves, murderers and turncoats. Their prize? A treasure chest of cash that can fund ever-more-ambitious missions against the hated ruling elite.\nIf you watched the first season of the Star Wars spin-off TV series Andor, you'll recognise this plot as one of the high points. Over three episodes, anti-hero Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and his band of accomplices hide out in mountain passes on the planet Aldhani, fine-tuning an audacious smash-and-grab from an Imperial garrison which is storing the wages of an entire sector.\u00a0\nThe real-life theft that inspired it was also a long, long time ago, just not quite so far away.\nIt took place in Yerevan Square in what was then the imperial Russian city of Tiflis, now the Georgian capital Tblisi, on 26 June 1907. A shipment of cash for the city's Russian state bank branch, amounting to some 300,000 roubles ($1m at the time), was stolen by a gang of robbers linked to the Bolshevik revolutionary movement. Using bombs and guns, the gang left a scene of utter devastation in their wake; some 40 people were killed and dozens more injured. The news of the brazen daylight attack made headlines across the world.\nThe heist was the brainchild of a charismatic cobbler's son-turned-revolutionary called Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili. He was a gifted public speaker, an ex-seminary student, a romantic poet rumoured to have left a string of broken hearts in his rakish wake. He often went by the name \"Soso\" (which he had used when writing poems for local publications), though in years to come he would become far better-known \u2013 and feared \u2013 as Joseph Stalin.\u00a0\nYes, the troubled outlaw beloved by Star Wars fans everywhere is based in part on one of history\u2019s most notorious mass murderers, as the series' creator, Tony Gilroy, has acknowledged. \"If you look at a picture of young Stalin, isn\u2019t he glamorous,\" Gilroy said in an interview in\u00a0Rolling Stone in 2022. \"He looks like Diego!\"\nStalin took Russia from its war-ravaged imperial decline to a nuclear-armed superpower in just three decades, but also presided over a reign of authoritarian terror that starved, executed or imprisoned millions of its own citizens. Countless books had been written on his cruel years in power, but very little on his early years. Writer Simon Sebag Montefiore saw a gap, and began rifling through archives in post-Soviet countries to try and separate the truth from myth, and tell the little-known story of Stalin's early life.\nIn 2007 \u2013 a century after the infamous heist in Tiflis \u2013 Young Stalin was published. It delved into the early life of the Soviet Union's dictatorial leader. \"Should the life of a black-hearted ogre, a mass murderer who was the wickedest of the 20th-Century's monsters, be quite so entertaining,\" asked a review in The Observer at the time.\nOne person who read Young Stalin was Gilroy. The writer and producer, who had scripted the first four Bourne films and the Andor-precursor film, Rogue One, was planning a TV series that would explore Cassian Andor's journey from casual thief to rebellious figurehead. The true story of a revolutionary movement on the far fringes of a real empire gave Gilroy his source material. \"Literally, I\u2019m the classic old white guy who just can\u2019t get enough history,\" Gilroy said in Rolling Stone. \"The last 15 years, I\u2019ve been reading all non-fiction.\" He added that Young Stalin was \"an amazing book\" and that its account of the Tiflis bank robbery was an \"incredible movie sequence\".\nDid Sebag Montefiore ever think to himself, 'Here's the perfect setting for a Star Wars spin-off,' when he was researching his book? \"No, I didn't ever think that when I was toiling in the archives in Moscow and Tbilisi,\" he tells the BBC. \"But I did think that there was something pretty elemental about the life of Stalin, especially before 1917. It was a fascinating story, partly because no one knew about it.\"\nThe Tiflis heist was reported around the world and funded the revolutionaries' movement for years, says Sebag Montefiore. \"Lenin and the whole Bolshevik Party lived off that money until the [1917] revolution.\"\nSebag Montefiore says that the young Stalin and the troubled Andor bear striking similarities: \"A young man from nowhere with a revolutionary ideology, and a fight against a huge empire,\" the writer says. \"I did think there was something interesting about the secret life of someone in that situation. That's basically what Tony Gilroy has focused on in Andor.\"\nStalin was, of course, not the only figure fomenting turmoil in Tsarist Russia, and Andor fleshes out other characters with attributes from the young Georgian's contemporaries. Among Andor's co-conspirators in the Aldanhi heist is Karis Nemik (Alex Lawther), an idealist writing a high-minded manifesto for the emerging resistance, similar to Bolshevik Leon Trotsky's polemics amid the opulent decline of Romanov rule.\nStellan Skarsg\u00e5rd's character, Luthen Rael, is an analogue for Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader who was able to form a powerful movement from unlikely bedfellows. A wealthy art collector, Luthen's precise manners in front of his gilded customers hide an uncompromising hatred of the empire and a restless desire to fund a growing resistance. In Cassian's talented, taciturn thief he sees a useful tool; Lenin saw the same in Stalin. \"In 1911, people said to Lenin, 'Why are you using this guy? He's a gangster. He's had people killed. He was involved in all these bank robberies,'\" says Sebag Montefiore. \"And Lenin replies, 'He's exactly the type we need.' Stalin could edit a paper. He could write and could read. And he was also someone who could arrange a hit on somebody and arrange a bank robbery. That was what Lenin talked about: some people were tea drinkers, and other people were thugs, Stalin could do both, and that's why Stalin won in the end.\"\u00a0\nThe research into historical rebellions \u2013 Gilroy has said he studied other revolutions while writing Andor, as well \u2013 has no doubt helped create the show's oddly realistic feel. Andor feels more down to earth than anything the Star Wars universe has shown us before, if you'll excuse the occasional spaceship roaring overhead, or an alien or two sitting in the local bar. There are flashes of mundane detail rarely scene in big-budget sci-fi. People complain that Andor's mother Maarva's (Fiona Shaw) house is always too cold. Security officer Syril Karn's (Kyle Soller) petulant intensity even extends to tailoring his uniform to make him look smarter than his contemporaries. The Imperial Security Bureau hoping to root out the emerging rebellion is a nest of competing ambitions that feels as real as anything in a historical drama \u2013 or in everyday office politik. There are fewer blaster-toting Stormtroopers than there are in the Star Wars films, and more sadistic, trenchcoated officers who would have been right at home in the Tsarist secret police, the Okhrana, or its Soviet replacement, the Cheka.\n\"In the past, Star Wars movies drop us in at a very big moment,\" says Walter Marsh, an Australian writer who praised Andor's grown-up worldview in The Guardian in 2022. \"There's the big climactic battle, or Luke Skywalker's heroic journey, and they're these big themes of good versus evil. But as any historian will tell you, wars and empires and revolutions don't start and end overnight, and there's always this bigger backstory. There's this sort of long tail. It takes years for that kind of colonial rot, those systems of control, to set in.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Japanese film that Star Wars stole from\n\u2022 The truth about Henry VIII's right-hand man\n\u2022 Black Mirror's most 'devastating' episode ever\nAndor shows the corruption and brutal entitlement found at every layer of autocratic regimes: the guards drinking in a brothel while they're supposed to be on duty (and prepared to shake down anyone they don't like the look of); the prison industrial system that requires constant additions even if the new prisoners have done nothing wrong; the subtle sabotage of ethnic pilgrimages to sacred land that is earmarked for imperial development. And with authoritarianism on the rise around the globe, Andor has as much to say about today's world as it does about Stalin's.\u00a0\n\"When the show came out I think I was pleasantly surprised to see a story in that universe that was familiar, but which also approached this question of empire that's been so central to the whole franchise, but was never actually tackled in a really nuanced and human character-driven way,\" Marsh tells the BBC. \"It's all well and good to have a big, evil Sith Lord achieve global, universal domination. But how does power assert itself on the street level, from one human to another?\n\"The Empire is this huge grinding, unthinking machine, but it's also a very human thing,\" Marsh continues. \"Who are the people that find a place and thrive in those systems?\" He remarks that in the original films the Imperials were little more than blank-and-you-miss-them pantomime villains: \"British guys in suits getting choked by Darth Vader at some point, who are just fiddling with buttons in the background.\"\nAndor's strength is its \"three-episode arcs that showed us the kind of death by a thousand cuts that it takes to achieve this sort of social, political and economic dominance\", says Marsh. \"The converse of that is it shows all the ways in which that kind of oppression inspires pushback and resistance in all kinds of different ways.\"\nThe new season, which begins on Tuesday 22 April, will develop the rebellion's story as it rushes towards the events seen in Rogue One: the scenes of brutal Imperial reactions to a demonstration shown in the trailer evoke the Tsarist crackdown on a St Petersburg march in 1905, which was a\u00a0 slow-burning contributor to the Bolshevik revolution.\n\"The scavenger who becomes a passionate revolutionary leader is kind of fascinating,\" says Sebag Montefiore of the troubled Cassian Andor. \"That's a great trajectory, because that's exactly what Stalin did. And it'll be interesting to see how deep Gilroy uses that \u2013 how far he goes to create a character with both heroic and villainous features.\"\nGeorge Lucas's original film trilogy rooted the rebellion in the classic good-guys-versus-bad-guys dynamic of countless Saturday matinee cliffhangers, the resistance modelled after anti-Nazi opposition in occupied Europe. The rebels of Andor inhabit a much more compromised reality; like real-life revolutionary movements, they are much more complicated than the ones we usually see on screen. Luthen, Andor's Lenin proxy, considers it with chilling deliberation in one of the first season's standout scenes: \"I'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else's future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I\u2019ll never see.\"\nAs Sebag Montefiore notes, the revolutionaries themselves knew deep down that if they took power, they themselves would have to use repression as a tool; they would become what they once despised. \"Lenin himself said: 'A revolution without firing squads is meaningless.'\"\u00a0\nAndor season two is available on Disney+ from 22 April.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "McLaren's Oscar Piastri leads the 2025 drivers' championship after victory in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\nAfter the first triple header of the season, there is a week's break before Formula 1 heads to Miami from 2-4 May.\nBefore that, BBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions following the race in Jeddah.\nWill Max Verstappen modify his driving as a result of the decision to give him a five-second penalty in Saudi Arabia? - Kate\nMax Verstappen was given a five-second penalty in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because the stewards adjudged him to have gained an advantage by leaving the track while contesting the lead with McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the first corner.\nThe stewards pointed to the driving standards guidelines in making their decision, reporting that \"Car 81 (Piastri) had its front axle at least alongside the mirror of Car One (Verstappen) prior to and at the apex of corner one when trying to overtake Car One on the inside.\n\"In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car One at the apex. Based on the drivers' standards guidelines, it was therefore Car 81's corner and he was entitled to be given room.\"\nVerstappen chose not to give his opinion of the incident or the decision after the race, pointing to the risk he would be censured by governing body the FIA.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the penalty was \"very harsh\" because \"Max can't just disappear\".\nThe guidelines don't dictate what a driver in his situation should do, but taking the lead back by going off track is not an option. \nBut Verstappen races hard, and pushes the limit of the rules. In critical situations such as this, he will do everything he can to keep position, and then force the stewards to make a decision.\nThis is understandable on two levels: first, the advantage of being in front and running in clean air is significant, as the race subsequently showed, and if he ends up being allowed to keep the position, it can win him the race; second, in the past, the stewards have often chosen not to punish him.\nHowever, the guidelines have changed this year, after significant pressure from the other drivers, exactly because of the way Verstappen races.\nThis was the first time the new rules have been tested with Verstappen, and this time his approach did not work. But he has had a lifetime of racing this way, so it would be quite a switch for him to change his approach.\nHaving said that, he is smart as well as tough. It would be a surprise if he did not learn from this incident in some ways for next time.\nFrom Piastri's side, he has now laid down a marker to Verstappen. He is a decisive, clinical racer who is not to be intimidated.\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side in Saudi Arabia\nDoes Lando Norris need to go sit down with Nico Rosberg to understand how he changed his mentality in his championship year? \u2013 Gary\nIn 2016, Nico Rosberg won the championship by pushing himself to the limit to be able to compete with an essentially faster team-mate in Lewis Hamilton, ensuring he was his best self all the time and hoping that would be enough.\nRosberg was handed a significant advantage with the comparative reliability of the two Mercedes at the start of the season, and even then Hamilton would have clawed the advantage back had he not had an engine failure while leading in Malaysia late in the season.\nThe situation at McLaren this year feels different. In 2024, Norris was decisively the faster and more convincing McLaren driver over the season. In 2025 so far, that has been Piastri.\nNorris is struggling to adapt to certain characteristics of the McLaren - particularly its lack of front grip at certain phases of the corner with his driving style.\nBut he is aware of what he needs to do. As he put it in Jeddah on Sunday: \"It's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute. That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car.\n\"Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\"\nOf course when the margins are so tight - pole is being decided by hundredths of a second at each race - it's one thing to say that, and another to do it without coming off second best.\nDuring the race in Saudi Arabia, Liam Lawson picked up a 10-second penalty for completing his pass on Jack Doohan off-track, so gained an advantage. Max Verstappen only got five seconds for his off-track advantage. What's the difference between these two? - James\nAs the stewards explained in the verdict on Verstappen: \"Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is 10 seconds.\n\"However, given that this was lap one and a turn one incident, we considered that to be a mitigating circumstance and imposed a five-second time penalty instead.\"\nSo Lawson got the standard penalty because it was during the body of the race, whereas Verstappen's had the mitigating circumstances of being on the first lap, which has come to be treated differently because of the proximity of all the cars.\nWhy can't we go back to having a penalty that actually changes the position of the cars on track almost immediately (e.g. drive-through etc) rather than at a pit stop or after the race is completed? \u2013 Neil\nAfter the controversy of the title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi in 2021, it was decided that teams should no longer be able to talk directly to the race director during a grand prix.\nHowever, they can still talk to his assistants in race control and discuss incidents. So when a driver does a manoeuvre that looks borderline, teams have three options.\nThey can choose proactively to give the place back - as McLaren did with Lando Norris against Lewis Hamilton in Bahrain.\nThey can get in touch with race control and ask for an opinion on the move, and then make a decision as to what to do about it.\nOr they can plough on and hope for the best, as Red Bull did in Jeddah.\nThe FIA stewards will then make their decision as to how to handle it. They have moved away from ordering drivers to give the position back, preferring specific penalties for specific offences.\nOf course, the risk of this approach is that a driver in a faster car can commit an offence to gain an advantage and then effectively overturn the penalty before he serves it by building a lead bigger than the time loss of the penalty.\nThis is why Red Bull and Verstappen did not give the place back in Saudi Arabia.\nSome people will see that as gaining from an unfair advantage, which is what the penalty is trying to prevent, so this approach clearly has potential flaws. But it is where the sport has landed for now.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nSaudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nWilliams have already beaten their 2024 full season points total. What has made them so much better? \u2013 Stewart\nWilliams' progress this season is a direct result of the investment put in by owners Dorilton since they took over in 2020 and the changes to the team made under new boss James Vowles.\nInto last year, the introduction of new factory processes caused a difficult winter, the car barely made the first test and it was overweight for the first chunk of the season.\nThe difference this year was dramatic - their launch was held at Silverstone in public view in mid-February, and they ran the car for the first time there.\nWilliams are very much focused on 2026 and the new rules being introduced then, but as Vowles put it at the launch: \"What I can demonstrate is very clear progress that's taken place in manufacture, process, technology kicking in.\n\"We are moving into a new building this year, a benchmark driver in-the-loop simulator, that was started in 2023. The fact we've gone from 700 people to 1,000 means you'll have low-hanging fruit of producing a better car with more performance added to it. But I consider that second to the long-term investment to get us where we need to be.\"\nBeing on the weight limit sounds like a small detail but is actually a big deal. Last year, it was costing them not far off 0.5 seconds a lap early in the year. Add that to this year's performance, and instead of being the fifth quickest car on average, as they are now, they would be eighth fastest, ahead of only Haas and Sauber.\nOn top of that, Williams now has two world-class drivers rather than just one. And they are not crashing like they were last year.\nAlex Albon ran with the car's improved performance and scored good points in the first three races, while both he and Carlos Sainz were in the top 10 in Saudi Arabia.\nSo, in a nutshell, the team has made progress, they have a better driver line-up and you're seeing it in the performance of the car.\n\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

But sources had said Vance was hoping he could secure even a brief moment with the Pope - a personal goal for him as a Catholic, as well as a political one. \nThe pontiff was a long-time critic of US President Donald Trump. In 2016, he questioned then-presidential candidate Trump's faith, saying \"a person who thinks only about building walls... and not of building bridges, is not Christian\". \nRecently, he referred to Trump's immigration views as \"an ugly thing\", and his plans to ramp up deportations as a \"disgrace\". Caring for migrants was a signature issue for the Pope. \nVance has defended Trump's policies, sometimes invoking his own religious beliefs in response to the criticism. Still, his visit was aimed at thawing relations, insiders said.\nOn Saturday, Vance also met the Vatican's secretary of state and secretary for relations with states and international organisation.\nIn a statement, the Vatican described \"cordial talks\" on Saturday that affirmed \"good existing bilateral relations\" and a \"common commitment\" to protect freedom of religion.\nOn Sunday, Vance's office confirmed a visit to the Pope that lasted about 15 minutes. Vance \"expressed his gratitude to Pope Francis for inviting him to meet on Easter Sunday and for the hospitality the Vatican has extended to his family\".  \nVance converted to Catholicism in 2019, then in his mid-30s. He wrote that he found the family and social values of the Catholic Church appealing and of a part with his view of conservative politics.\nStill, amid his disagreements with Pope Francis on immigration, he acknowledged that his faith was newer and may differ from Pope Francis's, even as he revered the Pope. The US Catholic Church has at times clashed with Pope Francis, taking a more conservative approach to social issues.\nAt the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington in February, Vance referred to himself as a \"baby Catholic\" and said there were \"things about the faith that I don't know\".\nThe death of Pope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church, was announced on Monday. He was 88.\n\"This morning at 07:35 local time (05:35 GMT) the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father,\" Cardinal Kevin Farrell said in the statement, which was published by the Vatican on its Telegram channel.\nAlso on Sunday, Francis appeared at the Vatican's St Peter's Square to wish thousands of worshippers a happy Easter.\nHe had been discharged from hospital last month, after five weeks of treatment for an infection that led to double pneumonia.",

        "article_text": "Max Verstappen started the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix from pole position\nMax Verstappen refused to discuss his unhappiness with a penalty he was given in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix because he was concerned about retribution from Formula 1's governing body the FIA.\nThe four-time champion's five-second penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage in a first-corner battle with McLaren's Oscar Piastri potentially cost him the race win to the Australian.\nVerstappen said: \"You can't share your opinion because it's not appreciated apparently, or people can't handle the full truth. Honestly, it's better if I don't say too much.\n\"It's honestly just how everything is becoming. Everyone is super-sensitive about everything. And what we have (in the rules) currently, we cannot be critical anyway. So less talking \u2013 even better for me.\"\nVerstappen's comments are a reference to a change in the FIA's rule book over the winter that codified a series of penalties for drivers who either repeatedly swear or criticise the governing body. \nThese were introduced at the behest of FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem and can lead to a one-month ban plus deduction of championship points.\nThe changes were introduced after drivers' swearing in news conferences last year led to controversial penalties. \nVerstappen had to do a motorsport equivalent of community service for using a swear word in a news conference at the Singapore Grand Prix. And Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fined for doing the same in Las Vegas.\nSaudi 'horrible' & 2025 looking 'painful' - Hamilton\nPiastri wins in Saudi Arabia and takes title lead\nChequered Flag podcast: Saudi Arabian Grand Prix review\nVerstappen said in the official news conference in Jeddah on Sunday: \"I cannot swear in here, but at the same time, you also can't be critical in any form that might 'harm' or 'danger'... Let me get the sheet out. There's a lot of lines, you know?\n\"So that's why it's better not to talk about it \u2013 you can put yourself in trouble, and I don't think anyone wants that.\"\nWhen it was put to him that being less expansive than previously had seemed to be a trend from him already this season, he said: \"It has to do with social media in general, and how the world is. I prefer not to talk a lot because sometimes your words can be twisted or people interpret it in a different way. It's honestly better not to say too much.\"\nThe phrase in the FIA sporting code to which Verstappen is referring forbids \"any words, deeds or writings that have caused moral injury or loss to the FIA, its bodies, its members or its executive officers, and more generally on the interest of motor sport and on the values defended by the FIA\".\nVerstappen and Piastri go into the first corner side by side\nVerstappen's radio messages during the race clearly indicated he did not approve of the penalty he was given, but he was warned to keep his thoughts to himself.\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said he felt the penalty was \"very harsh\" and asked rhetorically: \"Whatever happened to 'let them race on the first lap?' That just seems to have been abandoned.\"\nThe stewards' verdict contained an answer to that - it said that the normal penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage was 10 seconds, but they reduced it to five because it was the first lap.\nVerstappen was penalised for cutting the chicane after the start and keeping the lead.\nPiastri had got fully alongside him on the inside on the entry to the first corner. Despite this, Verstappen cut the second part of the chicane and retained the lead.\nF1's driving standards guidelines effectively say that the corner was Piastri's in that situation.\nThey say that for a driver overtaking on the inside to be \"entitled to be given room (his car) must have its front axle at least alongside the mirror of the other car prior to and at the apex, be driven in a fully controlled manner particularly from entry to apex and not have 'dived in''; and in the stewards' estimation have taken a reasonable racing line and been able to complete the move while remaining within track limits.\"\nPiastri comfortably complied with all these criteria.\nHe said: \"The stewards had to get involved, but I thought I was plenty far enough up (alongside) and in the end that's what got me the race.\n\"I knew that I had enough of my car alongside to take the corner. We obviously both braked extremely late. For me, I braked as late as I could while staying on the track. And I think how it unfolded is how it should have been dealt with.\"\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: \"Oscar, thanks to a very good launch off the grid, and thanks to positioning the car on the inside, [was] slightly ahead of Max, managing to keep the car within the track limits, then he gained the rights (to the corner), and obviously in that situation you can't overtake off track.\n\"This is a clear case. It shouldn't create any polemic, really.\"\nVerstappen led until the first pit stops, when he served the penalty and dropped behind Piastri, who controlled the race from there to take his third win in five grands prix this season.\nIt included a bold move around the outside of Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari on the approach to the high-speed Turns 22 and 23 at a critical point of the race, to minimise his time loss on the lap Verstappen stopped.\nVerstappen had shown strong pace in the first stint, tracked closely by the McLaren, and was pulling away slightly by the time Piastri made his stop on lap 19.\nOnce into the lead, Piastri controlled the race but was unable to extend the gap to Verstappen despite having the advantage of clean air.\nThe win put him into the lead of the championship for the first time in his short career - Piastri made his debut only in 2023. He is 10 points ahead of team-mate Lando Norris, with Verstappen a further two adrift.\nThe 24-year-old's performance has impressed Verstappen.\n\"He's very solid,\" Verstappen said. \"He's very calm in his approach, and I like that. It shows on track. He delivers when he has to, barely makes mistakes \u2013 and that's what you need when you want to fight for a championship.\"\nThe Dutchman also had praise for the influence of Piastri's manager, the former F1 driver Mark Webber.\n\"With Mark by his side, he's helping him a lot,\" Verstappen said. \"It's great.\n\"People learn from their own careers. That's what I had with my dad, and Mark is advising Oscar. At the end of the day, Oscar is using his talent, and that's great to see.\"\nLando Norris won the season opener in Australia\nPiastri was overshadowed by Norris in 2024, but has been the more impressive of the McLaren drivers since the start of this season.\nNorris, who fought back from 10th on the grid after a crash in qualifying to finish fourth, just nine seconds behind Piastri, admitted after the race that he needs to \"chill out a little bit\" and that he was \"not surprised\" he had lost the championship lead.\nHis crash in qualifying was his biggest mistake of the season but it comes after a series of small errors, usually in qualifying, that have harmed his chances in races since he won the season-opening grand prix in Australia from pole position.\n\"I have been very confident in my race, it's my qualifying, my Saturdays, which are not good enough at the minute,\" Norris said.\n\"That's because I am struggling a little bit with the car. Yesterday was not the car, it was just me trying to take too many risks.\n\"So I just have to peg it back. I've got the pace. It's all in there. It's just sometimes I ask for a bit too much and sometimes I get a bit too 'ego' probably and try to put the perfect lap together. I just need to chill out a little bit.\n\"I make my life too tough on Saturday. So it makes my Sundays a little more fun at times but I miss out on a few trophies. I have to work on my Saturdays and if I do that I am confident I can get back to where I was.\"\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated. And the final part of the script was written when Alexander-Arnold returned as a substitute with 19 minutes left, having been out since early March with an ankle injury.\nPremier League: Leicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold scores Liverpool winner - report & reaction\n'I know why Real appeal to Alexander-Arnold - I was tempted too'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\nSuperstar Trent Alexander Arnold's 'unbelievable' left foot half-volley\nIt took him five minutes to release the pressure valve, of sorts, that had been building as the doomed Foxes frustrated Liverpool.\nThe scenes that followed will be tantalising ones for any Liverpool fan who clings to the hope Alexander-Arnold will reject the advances of Real Madrid.\nCould there still be a late twist in Alexander-Arnold's long-running contract situation?\nCould the wild celebrations, and the communion between Alexander-Arnold and those fans in one red-drenched corner of King Power Stadium, make him rethink his next move?\nThere is confidence in Spain that Alexander-Arnold will be at Real Madrid next season - but the leaving of Liverpool will still be tough for a player who grew up in the city's West Derby district.\nHe has faced some criticism for not committing to Liverpool, especially since Salah and Van Dijk signed new contracts, but there was none here. This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

These were 10-year-olds,\" one teacher said.\nAnother teacher said: \"In a secondary English class last year, a group of boys opted, despite discouragement, to write a persuasive essay on why Andrew Tate is the GOAT (greatest of all time) which included praise of his view that women are a man's property... all of the parents were contacted and were appalled.\"\nIn an interview with the BBC in 2023, when pushed on whether his controversial views on women harmed young people, Tate claimed he was a \"force for good\". \nPatrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said \"there is an urgent need for concerted action involving schools, colleges and other agencies to safeguard all children and young people from the dangerous influence of far-right populists and extremists\".\n\"Teachers cannot be left alone to deal with these problems,\" he added.\nBut the founder of a group which trains professionals in how to work with boys and young men said the access young people have to pornography is \"way more impactful\" than the influence of people like Tate.\nMichael Conroy, who launched Men at Work in 2019, told BBC Breakfast: \"Without porn, Andrew Tate would not be a known name.\n\"Our boys, sadly, are learning about sex through porn, and it is usually representing to them a difference of power between men and women. \n\"That chimes when they see work from people like Andrew Tate.

        "article_text": "In India, you can face criminal charges for tethering an animal on the street, flying a kite in a manner that causes alarm, skipping a school attendance order or handing a feeding bottle to a mother who can't breastfeed.\nOf the 882 federal laws on the books, 370 contain criminal provisions - together criminalising 7,305 acts and omissions. These range from the absurd to the serious: failing to give a month's notice before quitting your job or not walking your dog enough, to offences like illegal arms possession, murder and sexual assault.\nDelhi-based think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy calls it \"India's crisis of over-criminalisation\".\nIn a new report, The State of the System: Understanding the Scale of Crime and Punishment in India, the think-tank has produced the country's first comprehensive database of crimes, mapping the extent of criminalisation across 370 federal laws.\nThe report flags India's habit of reaching for criminal law to solve just about everything - even the mundane. It notes that many laws criminalise \"routine, everyday actions\". \nYou could, for instance, be charged for tethering your goat on a public street, fixing a leaky tap without a licence or not naming the owner of a building when asked. \nThen there are the truly obscure offences - like a parent ignoring a school attendance order, applying for a driver's licence when banned or littering in a zoo. Basically, there's a criminal penalty waiting around every corner of daily life.\nLet your pigs wander on to a field or road and you could be fined 10 rupees (12 cents). Disturb an animal or litter in a zoo? Six months in jail or a 2,000-rupee fine. And failing to exercise your dog can cost you up to 100 rupees and three months in jail.\nPromoting infant milk substitutes or feeding bottles to pregnant women or mothers can lead to up to three years in jail or a 5,000-rupee fine. (This was meant to curb aggressive marketing by formula food companies, but the law also applies to individuals, which makes it controversial.)\nJail is the go-to punishment in India - 73% of crimes carry prison terms ranging from a single day to 20 years.\nMore than 250 offences across 117 laws penalise delays in filing documents - everything from wealth and property tax returns to gift declarations, the report finds. \nSome 124 crimes across 80 laws criminalise obstructing a public officer, often without clearly defining what causes \"obstruction\". \nEven the death penalty isn't off the table - not just for murder or mutiny, but for damaging an oil or gas pipeline or a sentry caught sleeping on duty. In all, a staggering 301 offences in India can legally cost you your life.\nOut of 7,305 offences under central laws, nearly 80% come with fines - from as low as two rupees to a staggering 50m rupees. \nTo be fair, many of these provisions are rarely used - India's crime records bureau tracks around 50 laws, even though 370 carry criminal penalties.\n\"They're not heavily enforced, but they create ample opportunities for rent-seeking,\" Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, co-author of the study at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, told me.\n\"There's enough in the books to jail almost anyone for some technical non-compliance. It's less about actual use and more about the potential for misuse.\"  \nThis \"excessive use of criminal law not only disrupts the daily lives of ordinary citizens but also creates significant barriers for business operations\", the report says. \nBusinesses in India face a maze of regulations, but using criminal law as the default for non-compliance is excessive, disproportionate and often counter-productive, experts say.\nThe report also talks about some glaring inconsistencies in crime and punishment.\nRioting - the use of force or violence by an unlawful assembly - is punishable with up to two years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, falsely reporting a birth or death for official records can lead to three years of imprisonment. \nThe irony? Violence in public gets a lighter sentence than a lie on paper.\nEven more striking: crimes of vastly different severity carry the same penalty - like practicing homoeopathy without a licence, jumping a red light, or forcing someone into labour - all punishable with a one-year sentence.\nThe sheer number of crimes tied to everyday life and business shows how heavily the state leans on criminalisation to enforce compliance, the report says.\n\"This over-reliance has significant costs, not just for citizens and businesses, but also for state machinery.\"\nOver 34 million criminal cases are pending in India's courts, with 72% stuck for more than a year. Prisons are overcrowded, running at 131% capacity, while courts and police forces continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages\nEven the law-and-order machinery is stretched. As of 1 January 2023, India had just 154 police personnel per 100,000 people - well below the sanctioned 195. Nationwide, there are 581,000 vacancies against an approved strength of 2.72 million.\n\"Even then, we continue to rely on this overburdened system to combat minor infractions, including those that attract nominal fines,\" the report says.\nIt says that criminal law should be limited to acts that threaten core societal values - like public safety, national security, life, liberty, property and social harmony.\nAuthorities say they plan to scrap criminal penalties in more than 100 legal provisions - on top of the 180 already axed in 2023. It's not just legal clean-up; it's a chance to rethink how the law treats people. Less fear, more trust. Less suspect, more citizen.  ",

        "article_text": "Perched on top of Santorini's sheer cliffs is a world-famous tourist industry worth millions. Underneath is the fizzing risk of an almighty explosion.\nA huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.\nNow scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.\nBBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.\nJust weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.\nIt was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.\nProf Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.\n\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.\nThis work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent. \nSantorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".\n\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.\n\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.\nThe Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.\nBeneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.\n\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.\nThe robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.\nThose vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.\nThey are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.\nSo far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.\n\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.\nThe Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.\nThe two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.\nThe expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.\nShe is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.\n\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.\nIt will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.\nThese missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.\nJohn Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.\n\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"\nPointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"\nThese rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.\nBut the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.\nUsing a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found. \nThey have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.\nThey identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.\nThis is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.\n\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.\nThe recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.\nBack on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.\n\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.\nShe's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says.\nIn the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.\nShe believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting.\n\"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said.\nBut Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot.\nThe couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks.\n\"Actually we wanted to get married by a volcano,\" Tom says, his bride Kristina by his side.",

They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".Kevin Church/BBCIsobel Yeo says the work will forecast hazards from underwater volcanoes globally\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to.

But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation.

        "article_text": "The \"Blue Marble\" was the first photograph of the whole Earth and the only one ever taken by a human. Fifty years on, new images of the planet reveal visible changes to the Earth's surface.\n\"I'll tell you,\" said astronaut Harrison Schmitt as the Apollo 17 hurtled towards the Moon, \"if there ever was a fragile-appearing piece of blue in space, it's the Earth right now\".\nIt was Thursday 7 December 1972, that humanity got its first look at our planet as a whole. In that moment, the photograph \"The Blue Marble\" was taken \u2013 one which changed the way we saw our world.\n\"I can see the lights of southern California, Bob,\" said Schmitt to ground control about one and a half hours into the flight. \"Man's field of stars on the Earth is competing with the heavens.\"\nThe crew of the Apollo 17 \u2013 commander Eugene Cernan, command module pilot Ronald Evans and lunar module pilot Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt \u2013 were watching their home recede into the distance as they journeyed into space for the last manned mission to the Moon.\nLooking back towards the Earth, Cernan commented: \"the clouds seem to be very artistic, very picturesque. Some in clockwise rotating fashion\u2026 but appear to be\u2026 very thin where you can\u2026 see through those clouds to the blue water below.\"\nIt is an enduring image of the beauty but also the vulnerability of our planet \u2013 adrift as it is in the vastness of the Universe, which hosts no other signs of life that we have been able to detect to date. But ours is also a planet of great change. The tectonic movements that shift the landmasses move too slow for our eyes to notice. Yet another force \u2013 humanity itself \u2013 has been reshaping our planet at a pace that we can see. Urbanisation, deforestation, pollution and greenhouse gas emissions are altering the way the Earth looks. So how, over the 50 years since that iconic image was taken, has the Blue Marble changed?\nThose first images of the Blue Marble were taken by the crew, who passed the onboard camera \u2013 a hand-held analogue Hasselblad 500 EL loaded with 70mm Kodak film \u2013 between them, captivated by the sight of the Earth from space.\n\"All the images captured with Hasselblads are spectacularly clear and bright,\" says Jennifer Levasseur, curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.\u00a0\nThe camera was specially modified for use in space, she adds. Glues, lubricants, moving parts and batteries could all cause problems or fail when exposed to the extremes of hot and cold in space. It was also given a large square shutter-release button so the crew could use it while wearing their cumbersome spacesuits.\n\"The other major modification, was the removal of the viewing screen \u2013 because it's extra glass,\" Levasseur says, The astronauts, \"had to learn how to take pictures without being able to see anything\", she says. \"Without a viewfinder, you can't see what you're taking.\"\nTaking photos, says Levasseur, was planned meticulously and written into the mission plan. \"They had known previous launches wouldn't give them whole Earth, but on this one the whole Earth would be entirely illuminated by the light of the Sun.\"\u00a0\nIt was around five hours and 20 minutes into the flight that the crew got their first glimpse of the entire planet. The crew were starting to get ready for bed, zipping into their sleeping bags. It was their first moment of downtime since the launch.\u00a0\n\"I suppose we're seeing as 100% full Earth as we'll ever see,\" said Cernan. \"Bob, it's these kind of views that stick with you forever\u2026 There's no strings holding it up either. It's out there all by itself.\"\u00a0\nThe Blue Marble image was captured at around\u00a029,000km (18,000 miles)\u00a0from Earth, as the Sun lit up the globe from behind the Apollo 17.\nAlmost six hours into the flight, Schmitt laughed. \"The problem with looking at the Earth, particularly Antarctica, is it's too bright,\" he said, \"And so I'm using my sunglasses through the monocular\".\nBack home, it was nearing 05:00 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and ground control was quiet. \"I'm not keeping you awake, am I, Bob?\" asked Schmitt. \"Just keep talking. We're listening,\" came the voice from the capsule communicator. And so the conversation continued long into the flight, the crew describing the clouds drifting over the ocean and the continents of home.\nPrevious Apollo missions had snapped the Earth partly hidden by shadow. The hugely influential, Earthrise, for instance,\u00a0shows the planet as it rises behind the Moon. Up until this point, our view of home had been fragmented, with no real way to visualise the planet in its entirety. (Read more about how Earthrise sparked an environmental movement.)\nSuddenly, glowing in the light of the Sun, the Earth was revealed as a beautiful shining blue orb, full of life and alone in the vastness of space. As a result, the Blue Marble is thought to have had more influence on humanity than any other photograph in history.\u00a0\n\"If you can't see something, it's hard to visualise that it exists,\" says Nick Pepin, a climate scientist at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. \"I think all of us who have been brought up with that [image] from a young age probably find it difficult to imagine a time when we didn't know what the Earth looked like. This was the first time that we could actually look back from space and see our home \u2013 and people suddenly realised it was an amazing thing, but also a fixed system that we live on.\"\u00a0\nThe image offers a view of the Earth from the Mediterranean Sea area to the Antarctica South polar ice cap. Heavy cloud hangs over the Southern Hemisphere, and almost the entire coastline of Africa can be seen.\nNasa officially credits the image to the entire crew. We may never know which of them actually took it but today it is reported to be one of the most reproduced images of all time.\nAt 07.39 GMT on 7 December 2022 \u2013 50 years later to the minute since the original was taken \u2013 a new \"Blue Marble\" was\u00a0captured by a satellite orbiting a million miles away. This time, a set of 12 images taken 15 minutes apart, reveal noticeable changes to our planet's surface, the result of 50 years of global warming.\nIn the 50 years that separates these two snapshots in time, one of the most striking differences is the visible reduction in the size of the Antarctic ice sheet. \"You can see the shrinking cryosphere \u2013 the shrinking ice sheet and the loss of the snow,\" says Pepin says. This, he says, is a major indicator of climate change.\nThe Sahara Desert has also grown while the rainforest \"is retreating further south\", he adds. Research has shown that tree cover in the vast Sahel region that borders the Sahara Desert has been in significant decline. \"The dominant thing that you can see on the [new] image is deforestation and the loss of vegetation\", as the Earth's land cover switches from greenery to desert.\nThe pictures were taken by Nasa's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera\u00a0(Epic), which has been imaging the sunlit side of Earth between 13 and 22 times a day since 2015. The satellite sits at the first Lagrange point, a point of equilibrium between the Sun and Earth, a million miles from Earth.\nFrom mid-April to mid-October, one photograph is taken of the Earth roughly every hour, and for the rest of the year it takes an image every two hours, says Alexander Marshak, deputy project scientist for Nasa's Deep Space Climate Observatory (Dscovr) satellite mission, which the camera is carried aboard.\u00a0\n\"With respect to the Blue Marble, on the 50th anniversary, we decided to take the same images at 15 minute intervals. So, in 15\u00a0minutes [the Earth] rotates around maybe 100km (62 miles),\" says Marshak. And, thanks to advances in technology, he adds, \"we can see the same images, but with much better quality\", even from a million miles away.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 'Earthrise': The photo that sparked an environmental movement\n\u2022 Out of this world: 11 spacewalks that made history\n\u2022 What the planets aligning really means \n\"And we can see much more than that,\" Marshak adds. \"We take images in 10 wavelengths, from UV [ultraviolet] to near infrared. From these images we can retrieve the property of ozone, of clouds, of water. The height of clouds, the location of clouds. We can look at the property of aerosols, the size of particles, the amount of particles. We retrieve even the shape of ice crystals [in the clouds], using the Sun's glint. We can [see] whether they're horizontally or randomly oriented.\"\n\"We retrieve [data on] the amount of leaves on Earth, and not only that but also the amount of leaves that are directly illuminated by the Sun,\" says Marshak. This data, combined with observations of ocean surface colour, can allow researchers to determine the rate of all photosynthetic activity on Earth.\nThe Dscovr programme hasn't been running long enough to draw any definitive conclusions, says Marshak, but they are starting to gather data that will provide new insights into how the world is changing \u2013 such as changes in cloud cover and height, reflectivity, and vegetation cover.\nAmong the other changes that have occurred since that first image of the entire Earth 50 years ago is the amount of human development and activity on our planet's surface. Although not visible in these images of the daylight side of the Earth, other satellites monitor for lights visible on the dark side of our planet. These show dramatic expansions in the urban sprawl across the continents alongside the activity of shipping on the Earth's oceans. Wildfires also glow across large swathes of the land at night, doubling in frequency in just the past 20 years.\nBack in 1972, the Blue Marble prompted a mass-reconsideration of our place in the Universe. Astronauts viewing Earth from space have reported a profound feeling of awe, a sense of interconnectedness and environmental awareness, and of self-transcendence. This is called the \"overview effect\".\u00a0\nIn the utter vastness of space, the beauty of Earth can be overwhelming. This feeling of intense awe has been found to elicit a fundamental change in thinking, a kind of cognitive realignment also called the \"need for accommodation\", as the person attempts to this process new perceptual information.\n\"Gobsmackingly \u2013 just \u2013 wow\" is how Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, described her first view of the Earth from space. It was 1991 and the 27-year-old chemist had just launched from Kazakhstan, to begin her journey to the Soviet Mir space station.\n\"We had two windows on the Soyuz spacecraft,\" she says. \"The commander, who sits in the middle, doesn't get a window. But the research cosmonaut, which was my job, and the flight engineer \u2013 we both had one. I had the right seat and flight engineer had the left seat. As we were launching, the spacecraft tipped my side very slightly towards the Earth. Immediately, the light streamed through that window.\"\nSharman describes her view of the curvature of the Earth, the \"gorgeous blue seas\", white clouds, and black space above. The Earth, she says, appeared as if it had its own glow. \"The Sun was at quite a low angle, so it would reflect off the sea, and then back up to the clouds \u2013 and off the clouds underneath to the Earth. Then [the light] came up so it felt as though the Earth had its own light source.\"\nShe compares the colour to the \"ultramarine of renaissance paintings\". \"It's quite unlike the rest of nature. It's that brightness against the blackness of space, you just see the Earth as this great big gorgeous blue dot.\"\u00a0\nThen, as her eyes began to adjust to the darkness of space, the stars appeared in their billions. \"We know there are probably billions of stars just in one small section of the Milky Way, maybe even trillions. And we think maybe there could be up to a couple of trillion galaxies in the Universe. That [makes you] realise the insignificance of Earth.\"\nSharman experienced these conflicting thoughts all at once. \"Our atmosphere is so thin. How easily that whole top layer, where most of life is, could just be wiped away.\" But, conversely, she adds, \"Earth is not the focal point of the Universe.\"\nTo this day Sharman dreams of \"floating along inside one of the modules and stopping by a window, looking out with the other crew\". The experience of\u00a0viewing the Earth from space, she says, \"definitely changed my life's priorities\". \"The most important thing is the people. And of course, the environment and ecology that's required to keep this Earth going.\"\nThe overview effect, say experts, is long-lasting and more powerful than other instances of awe. For the first time, the Blue Marble gave all of humanity the chance to experience the phenomenon to some degree. In fact, research shows that you can experience the overview effect with both feet firmly on the ground.\nLike Earthrise, the Blue Marble image became an emblem of the environmental movement. It showed a planet requiring stewardship at the global scale.\nThe Blue Marble was used to illustrate the\u00a0Gaia hypothesis, developed in the 1960s and '70s, which proposes that Earth and its biological systems act as a huge single entity, that exists in a delicate state of balance. And, although controversial among scientists, the theory kickstarted a holistic approach to Earth Science.\nThe image became a symbol of unity, too, as for the first time we could see the Earth without any human-imagined boundaries that divide us as they do on maps. The Blue Marble was\u00a0adopted\u00a0by activist groups like Friends of the Earth and events like Earth Day. Prior to this, environmental campaign images had often focused on pollution or endangered species.\u00a0\nThe photograph appeared on\u00a0postage stamps, and in the opening sequence of former US vice president Al Gore's documentary,\u00a0An Inconvenient Truth, and inspired research into Earth systems with the establishment of climate research institutions such as the Max-Planck Institut, based in Munich, Germany.\nLooking at the 1972 and 2022 Blue Marble images side-by-side, Pepin describes the Earth's \"restless atmosphere\". Visible in both images, are clouds formed above the green areas of rainforest, demonstrating the inextricable link between the forests and the rain. \"If you look at [central] Africa, you can see that most of the cloud, particularly on the earlier [image] is quite spotty, that indicates thunderstorms. Whereas if you go further north, and look at the Sahara desert, you can see there are no clouds.\n\"When you look from above you see all the connections, the overall relationships between areas,\" says Pepin. \"For example, Kilimanjaro rises from grassland, with snow on top. If you lived on the slopes you might not know there was snow on top and the importance of the connection between those areas.\"\nLooking at the Earth from space like this, he says, \"makes you appreciate the interlinkages between different parts of the ecosystems\". \"If you can only see your bit, you might think that environmental problems are only happening somewhere else and assume that 'it's not my problem',\" says Pepin.\u00a0\nHowever, the limitation, he says, is scale. \"You lose the detail. You need both. You need ground truthing [validating the information in the field] too.\"\nThere is a \"huge fundamental difference\" between these two images though, says Levasseur. \"One is captured by a human \u2013 and one is not. It doesn't have the same impact. And that's really because of the fact that there's no person there.\"\nLevasseur is looking forward to the photographs that will be brought home from the next manned mission to go as far as the Moon: Artemis II, planned for 2026. \"There's not going to be another whole Earth image in the way I think of it until humans go out away from Earth again. I wasn't alive in 1972. This is going to be a huge moment to know that people are looking at us from that far away.\"\n\"As much as we like to think of satellites as sort of our surrogates,\" she says, \"I know that there is a person behind that camera, so there is something different about it, and there always will be.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.",

        "article_text": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments. \n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. \nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him. \nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.In European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.Though the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence. \"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.Trump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession. But one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.",

Since then, Delhi and Washington have been working towards an early conclusion of trade negotiations.\nIn his speech in Jaipur, Vance said that the two countries had finalised the terms of reference for the negotiation.\n\"This is a vital step toward realising President Trump and Prime Minister Modi's vision because it sets a roadmap toward a final deal between our nations,\" Vance said.\nHe also called Modi a \"tough negotiator\" and someone \"who drives a hard bargain\", drawing applause from the audience.\nModi and Trump share a warm personal relationship: the Indian prime minister was among the first global leaders to visit Trump after his second term began. But the US president has repeatedly taken aim at India's high tariffs, branding it a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.\nEven in the statement issued on Monday after Vance's meeting with Modi, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer highlighted the \"serious lack of reciprocity in the trade relationship with India\".\nIndia has already cut tariffs on a number of goods in the past few months and is reportedly considering more wide-ranging cuts to pacify Trump. But sectors like agriculture - where Washington wants greater access, but India fiercely protects - are still sticking points. \nVance also said in Jaipur that the US is seeking to sell more energy and defence equipment to Delhi. On Monday, in addition to trade, the two leaders had also discussed cooperation in defence, strategic technologies and energy.\nThe Indian prime minister also said after the meeting that he was looking forward to welcoming Trump to India this year. Delhi is hosting the Quad summit later this year and the US president is expected to attend it.\nThe bilateral meeting was followed by delegation-level talks and a dinner hosted by Modi for Vance and his family. \nVance arrived in India on Monday morning, accompanied by his wife Usha and their three children. Usha Vance's parents migrated to the US from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and some media reports have said that Vance and his wife are keen to introduce their children to their Indian heritage.\nPhotographs of the three children wearing Indian-style outfits - the two boys in kurta-pyjamas and three-year-old Mirabel wearing a lehenga - on their arrival in India were splashed across Indian newspapers and websites.\nThe rest of Vance's visit is largely personal. After the meeting with Modi, the family visited Jaipur city, where they visited the historic Amer Fort on Tuesday. \nThe family is also set to visit the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra city on Wednesday before flying to the US the next day.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.\n\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.\nLucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.\nLucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.\nThe condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.\nLucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.\nThe abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.\n\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.\nThis is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.\nWithout medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.\nShe pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"\nAnd that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.\nIt is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.\nIn 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.\nIt is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.\n\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\" \nLucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.\nShe says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.\n\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"\nIP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.\n\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"\nIn response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.\nBut Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.\n\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.\n\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"\n\nLucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.\nNHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.\n\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"\nHer health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.\n\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"\nOnce she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.\nShe will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.\nOver a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.\nMeanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.\nThe embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.\nLucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.\n\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"\nA few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.\n\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.\n\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"\nYou can listen to Lucy Edwards on BBC Access All on BBC Sounds.

        "article_text": "After fleeing Silicon Valley for political and business reasons, Elon Musk is building a corporate campus in rural Texas \u2013 but his new neighbours have mixed views.\nHalf an hour east of Austin, past the airport, the clogged-up traffic starts to melt away and the plains of Central Texas open up, leaving the booming city behind.\nSomewhere along the main two-lane highway, a left turn takes drivers down Farm-to-Market Road 1209. It seems like an unlikely address for a high-tech hub, but that's exactly what Elon Musk, the world's richest man and one of President Donald Trump's closest allies, hopes it will become.\nCourt filings indicate that a large metal building finished in the last few months will be the new headquarters of X, his social media platform.\nA short distance away, a large logo of the Boring Company, Musk's infrastructure company, is plastered on the side of another headquarters.  And across FM 1209 is a rapidly growing SpaceX facility which manufactures Starlink satellite internet equipment.\nLike most technology tycoons, Musk had long made Silicon Valley his home and headquarters. Once a supporter of the Democrats, his move to Texas is part of a larger tech world trend and also appears to reflect his own transformed ideological views.\nHere the land is (relatively) cheap, skilled tech workers from nearby Austin are plentiful, and local laws are favourable to development.\nOf course, there are also specific political angles to the move.\nIn July 2024, Musk said he was quitting California after the state passed a law prohibiting teachers from enforcing rules about notifying families when students' gender identity changes. \nMusk has an estranged transgender daughter and has spoken out against what he calls \"woke mind virus\" - which he describes in interviews as divisive identity politics - along with anti-meritocratic and anti-free speech ideas.\nAnd so Musk upped sticks and headed to Texas, a Republican stronghold and the fastest-growing state in the US.\n\nIn addition to the cluster of buildings near Bastrop in central Texas, he has built a SpaceX facility in Cameron County, on the southern tip of Texas near the border with Mexico. SpaceX employees there have filed a petition to create a new town called Starbase. The measure will go to a vote in May.\nLocals in Bastrop have mixed feelings about the development.\n\"It's almost like we have a split personality,\" says Sylvia Carrillo, city manager of Bastrop, which has a growing population of more than 12,000. \"Residents are happy that their children and grandchildren will have jobs in the area. \n\"On the other hand it can feel like we are being overwhelmed by a third party and that the development will quickly urbanise our area,\" she says.\nAlthough the Musk development is technically outside of the city's limits, it's close enough that Texas laws give Bastrop's government sway over development. And, Ms Carrillo stresses, the Musk buildings are just one example of many developments springing up in a booming area.\n\"He's faced a backlash that is not entirely of his own creating,\" she says.\n\"But now that he's here and things are changing quickly, it's a matter of managing\" issues like house and land prices and the environment, she says.\nThe Musk compound is still fairly bare-bones. The grandly named Hyperloop Plaza sits in the middle of the corporate buildings, and is home to the company-owned Boring Bodega, a bar, coffee shop, hairdresser and gift shop.\nOn a recent windy Sunday afternoon, a video game console sat unplayed in front of a couch near a display of company T-shirts, while a few children scurried back and forth to a playground outside.\nThe developments in Bastrop fit right into the quickening pace of activity across central Texas, where cranes perpetually loom above the Austin skyline and the housing market is a perpetual topic of conversation.\nThe area has gone through various industry booms and busts over the years, including lumber and coal mining, says Judy Enis, a volunteer guide at the Bastrop Museum and Visitor Center. \nDuring World War Two, tens of thousands of soldiers - and around 10,000 German prisoners of war - poured in to Camp Swift, a US Army facility north of the town.\n\"That probably had more of an impact than Elon Musk,\" Ms Enis notes.\nViews of the tycoon are mixed, to say the least, and inseparable not only from his politics but also opinions on economic development, in what still is a predominately rural area.\nJudah Ross, a local real estate agent, says the development has supercharged population growth that started as a result of the Austin boom and accelerated during the Covid pandemic.\n\"I'm always going to be biased because I want the growth,\" Mr Ross says. \"But I love it here and I want to be part of it.\n\"If nothing else, what's good is the amount of jobs that this is bringing in,\" he says. \"In the past year,  I've sold to people working at Boring and SpaceX.\"\nAlfonso Lopez, a Texan who returned to the state after working in tech in Seattle, says he initially picked Bastrop figuring he would make a quick buck on a house purchase and move on. \nInstead, he quickly became enamoured with the town, its mix of local businesses and friendly people, and wants to stay.\n\nMr Lopez is no big fan of Musk and is critical of some of his management practices and politics, but admires the technology his companies have built and is happy to live nearby as long as the companies are good neighbours.\n\"As long as they don't ruin my water or dig a tunnel beneath my house and create a sinkhole, this isn't bad,\" he says, gesturing around the metal shed housing the bodega, coffee shop and bar. \"I'll come here and watch a game.\"\nHis concerns about water are more than theoretical. Last year The Boring Company was fined $11,876 (\u00a38,950) by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality after being cited for water pollution violations.\nThe Boring Company initially planned to dump wastewater in the nearby Colorado River but, after local pressure, signed a deal to send the sludge to a Bastrop wastewater treatment plant.\nThe water issues appear to have delayed housebuilding, which reportedly could include more than 100 homes for Musk employees. The planned development of homes has so far failed to materialise, however. For now, the extent of living quarters is a handful of temporary trailers behind the bodega building, surrounded by a wall, acres of Texas plain and a few horses munching grass. Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says any large-scale home building is at least a year off.\n\nIn November, SpaceX applied for a free trade zone designation, which would allow it to move materials and finished products in and out of the Bastrop factory without being subject to tariffs - one of Donald Trump's signature policies. \nIt's a common practice for manufacturers, and there are hundreds of similar zones across the country.\nLocal officials in Texas have endorsed the proposal, saying it will boost the local economy, despite costing the county an estimated $45,000 (\u00a334,800) in revenue this year. \nThe company is also getting an injection of $17.3m (\u00a313.4m) from the Texas government to develop the site, a grant that officials say is expected to create more than 400 jobs and $280m in capital investment in Bastrop.\nFew local residents wanted to directly criticise Musk when standing face-to-face with a visiting reporter. But it's a different story online, where sharper feelings shine through. \n\"They will ruin everything nearby,\" one resident posted on a local online forum. \"Nothing good comes with him.\" \n\nThe BBC contacted SpaceX, The Boring Company and X for comment.\nMs Carrillo, the city manager, says she hasn't picked up on much personal anger on the part of locals prompted by Musk's activities in Washington. \nBut to protect Bastrop, she says, the city has recently enacted laws limiting housing density and providing for public parks - measures that she says will keep the \"historic nature\" of the well-preserved downtown while allowing for growth on the outskirts.\nBastrop, she says, is a conservative, traditionally Republican place.\n\"His national stuff doesn't really register,\" she says. \"His companies have been good corporate citizens, and we hope it can stay that way.\"",

They would pay each other using traditional currency, like the pound sterling or US dollar.\nBut after seeing the e-money firm advertise its cryptocurrency services, he decided to give it a try.\nWhat Tzoni thought would be a straightforward transfer of cryptocurrency coins has left the Bulgarian national angry and out of pocket.\nHis experience highlights some of the frustrations people have had using cryptocurrency where many of the customer safeguards which underpin standard online banking transactions, some mandated by law, do not apply.\n\"When they treat you like this, it makes you feel like you can't do anything,\" he told BBC News. \"Like you are powerless.\"\nWhile the cryptocurrency market is dominated by Bitcoin, there is a plethora of other digital currencies, including USDC - which Tzoni had already amassed in a separate crypto account.\nHis frustrations began in February when he decided to transfer some of his USDC coins to his Revolut account.\nAs a precaution - which Revolut suggests doing - he first sent 10 of the coins, worth $10. It was a success and the funds were credited to his Revolut account.\nDays later he tried to make a larger transfer of what he thought was 1,500 USDC. The transfer was completed but, this time, the funds were not credited to his account.\nTzoni says the problem occurred because Revolut's deposit instructions were unclear.\nWhen you transfer cryptocurrency from one account to another, you have to select a network to send it through - like choosing which courier service to use when sending a parcel.\nRevolut's deposit instructions say to transfer USDC to it, you have to use a network called Polygon. In his first, successful, deposit Tzoni selected one called \"Polygon PoS\".\nIn the second deposit, when he tried to transfer 1,500 USDC, he selected a different network - \"Polygon (bridged)\". \nHe thought it would work just as well but says instead it caused the coins to be converted into USDC.e - a different cryptocurrency. \nThis is what Revolut received. The company does not handle USDC.e coins.\nAfter seeing his Revolut account had not been credited with the 1,500 coins, Tzoni contacted the Revolut support team.\nIn messages seen by BBC News, they told him the issue seemed to be with \"the specific type of Polygon network used, which led to the conversion\".\nIn another, he was told: \"The app currently specifies 'Polygon' without differentiating between standard and bridged options. I'll note your feedback for future improvements.\"\nTzoni thinks if Revolut's deposit instructions had been more specific, his problem would have been avoided.\nWhen approached by BBC News about this case, Revolut gave a different answer.\nThe firm said the problem was not because Tzoni had used the wrong Polygon network - which he claimed turned his coins into USDC.e.\nThe deposit failure was \"not because the network itself had 'converted' the token\", it said, without explaining why its support team had suggested to Tzoni that it was.\nRevolut told us the deposit ultimately failed because the USDC.e coins it received were not supported by the company's technology.\nIt said: \"As is standard industry practice due to the significant technical challenges involved in supporting every combination of token and chain, the recovery of these unsupported assets does not sit within Revolut's scope.\"\nIt means the 1,500 USDC.e coins have not been credited to Tzoni's account or sent back to him.\nTo Tzoni's mind, this isn't acceptable treatment from a company of Revolut's size and reputation, which handles normal banking deposits as well as cryptocurrency, stocks and commodities.\nRevolut says it has 10 million users in the UK while last year it was granted a provisional banking licence, paving the way for it to become a fully fledged UK bank.\nWhen using a High Street bank, a mistaken transfer of traditional currency would usually be resolved with the money being reverted back to the customer.\nThis was established in 2014 in a voluntary code of practice that most UK banks signed up to. There is no such equivalent in the cryptocurrency industry.\nAfter contacting Revolut several times in recent weeks, Tzoni has been told the coins are effectively lost.\n\"They are waiting for me to get bored and give up, to accept the money is gone. But I won't,\" Tzoni said, pointing out the coins are in the Revolut system. \"It is ridiculous that they can behave like this.\"\nWhile Tzoni's loss of cryptocurrency is significant to him, the sum is tiny compared with the size of the industry, which has risen sharply in value over the past 18 months.\nThe global market peaked in value at $3.9tn last December, following the re-election of Donald Trump. Since then it has fallen by $1.1tn, according to tracking website CoinGecko.\nGovernment policies in the US and other countries are also changing to favour the cryptocurrency industry, even though it has suffered several scandals.\nFTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency firms, went bankrupt in 2022. Sam Bankman-Fried, its chief executive, was sentenced to 25 years in prison last year for defrauding customers of billions of dollars.\nInvestigators also found FTX was using QuickBooks, a popular accounting software designed for individuals and small businesses, to manage the money.\nJohn Ray III, a lawyer tasked with recovering funds from FTX for defrauded customers, told a bankruptcy court: \"Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.\"\nHe later told a congressional hearing: \"Nothing against QuickBooks. It's a very nice tool, just not for a multibillion-dollar company.\"\nA couple of months ago Bybit, the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange by some estimates, was tricked out of $1.5bn worth of coins by hackers thought to be working for North Korea.\nThe firm had been using Safe, a free digital storage software popular with individuals who want to store cryptocurrency on their own devices, as part of their business operations.\nFollowing the theft, Bybit's chief executive said they \"should have upgraded and moved away from Safe\" earlier.\nOne of the problems with cryptocurrency firms, says Prof Mark Button, who researches cybercrime, is they can grow very quickly, which means they don't always keep up with the accounting and security challenges of managing so much money.\n\"For me it illustrates that if we are going to be serious about cryptocurrencies in the future\u2026 there needs to be some kind of regulation.\"\nIn Tzoni's case, it might have been easier for him to get his cryptocurrency back or be compensated if there were laws stating what firms need to do if they are sent a coin they don't handle.\nHigher industry standards might also have prevented him making such a transaction in the first place.\nMykhailo Tiutin is chief technology officer at AMLBot, a company that analyses how risky cryptocurrency transactions are.\nTheir service runs checks similar to those supported by banks, where details for a transfer, such as the account holder's name, sort code and account number, are verified.\nHe says cryptocurrency is safe enough for the average person to use but that they should be careful about which products and services they choose. He says he has also lost cryptocurrency after making an administrative mistake.\n\"You have to do your own research,\" he told us. \"The successes and the losses are ultimately at your own risk.\"",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions.

This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

Those who stayed offered a smattering of applause, yet it was an empty gesture.\nIt reflected a club in need of a rebuild but how, and with who, are the biggest questions as Leicester - champions of England nine years ago - face one of their biggest crossroads.\nLeicester relegated as Alexander-Arnold moves Liverpool closer to title\n'Iconic moment in a special Liverpool career - but was it a farewell?'\nLiverpool one win from title - but when could they clinch it?\nThis video can not be played\n'My responsibility to lead the club in the best way' - Nistelrooy\nWhen the Foxes sacked Steve Cooper in October they were 16th, although the cracks were there.\nThe teething problems in moving away from Enzo Maresca's style - less expansive and working the ball quicker - were just part of the issue. \nThe departed Maresca, who led them to the Championship title last season before joining Chelsea, was well-liked by the squad and Cooper struggled to connect with players, even if some of the senior members of the squad - including Jamie Vardy - were onside. \nThere was growing concern from the club that any disconnect would impact their survival prospects, and one of the reasons why they dismissed Cooper. \nSo, when Van Nistelrooy arrived, his honesty was welcomed, his methods and messages refreshing.\nFormer Manchester City Elite Development Squad coach Brian Barry-Murphy, who joined as assistant coach, also made an impressive first impression, with the players enjoying the variety and clarity he brought to training.\nYet, since the opening two games - a 3-1 win over West Ham and 2-2 comeback draw with Brighton in December - Leicester have won just four points.\nThey have equalled their club-record run of defeats (eight) and, despite performances which deserved more and the desire for the Dutchman to succeed, results have fallen off a cliff.\nThe Foxes were more competitive under Cooper - who sacrificed his beliefs to try to find a way to survive - and they drew a blank just once in his 12 Premier League games. \nThat is in stark contrast to the lack of goals under Van Nistelrooy - a revered striker for Manchester United, Real Madrid and the Netherlands - and they have scored just six times in the league since the draw with Brighton on 8 December.\nAnother goalless outing against Liverpool extended the home goal drought to nine league games and 810 minutes - the worst in top-flight history.\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"They have some big decisions to make. It has been awful for them. They have been miles off it.\"\nSome players have recently raised concerns over the standard and intensity of training with the drop-off being connected to Leicester's impending relegation, which was becoming increasingly inevitable.\nThe fall-out with midfielder Harry Winks - Van Nistelrooy has dropped him for the last four games for refusing to agree to stay at the training ground one night a week - emphasises the growing tensions. \nWhen asked about whether he had been able to improve the standards and culture in his five months at the club, Van Nistelrooy was clear.\n\"When you don't combine them with results it's always hard. There's no negotiation on these standards and I hold everyone accountable on those,\" the Dutchman said this month. \n\"I know how I worked from a village of 5,000 people in the middle of nowhere to Manchester United and Real Madrid. I know what is necessary to stay at the highest level and I know there are so many people working at this football club who have the quality to do so. But not enough yet. \n\"In difficult moments you get to know people and characters very well. I speak about standards and what is needed to perform at the highest level and that's a culture which needs to be created in this club.\"\nDefender Conor Coady has been one trying to raise spirits at the club's Seagrave training base, but it has been an almost impossible task with results - and he admitted Leicester have not been good enough. \n\"We've took a bit of stick and we'll continue to take stick because it's deserved,\" said the former England centre-back. \"From minute one this season, we haven't been at a level to fully compete in the Premier League and you have to be because it'll chew you up and spit you out.\"\nSusan Whelan, Jon Rudkin and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha watched Leicester's defeat to Liverpool\nAs the plane's banner suggested, director of football Jon Rudkin and the board have been the target for fans this season.\nThey see Rudkin as a root cause of their decline in recent seasons. He was, of course, in the same position when the Foxes stunned the world to win the Premier League in 2016, but supporters have made up their minds. \nIt does not help that the hierarchy rarely speak publicly, allowing supporters to understand and digest the situation.\nChief executive Susan Whelan twice met with the Foxes Trust and the club's Fan Advisory Board in February for candid and constructive meetings but the wider fanbase remain disconnected.\nDoes chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha decide to make a change at the top, does head of recruitment Martyn Glover's position come under more scrutiny following a number of poor transfer windows, regardless of financial constraints?\nVan Nistelrooy's position remains a doubt and it is hard to see a long-term future in the wake of damning statistics. \nDefeat against Liverpool leaves him with the unenviable record of having lost 17 of his 22 games, winning just three. He has lost 16 of his last 18 matches in charge, and what manager with that record survives?\nVan Nistelrooy, who confirmed there was no date set for talks on his future, said on Sunday: \"I'm waiting on the clarity of the club and how they want to continue.\n\"It is the goal to lead the club. I have to wait on how the club sees things and take it from there.\n\"The club has to use this time, otherwise you will waste it. In a situation like this you have to sit very carefully with the club to discuss the matters.\"\nYet sacking a second manager of the season has financial consequences and with money tight, it will be a consideration. Can Leicester financially afford to sack Van Nistelrooy but, going forward, can they afford not to?\nThere is also an acceptance the squad needs a reset but only three players are out of contract - goalkeepers Daniel Iversen and Danny Ward, and 38-year-old captain Jamie Vardy. \nWhat happens with Vardy - influential at the club as their last remaining title winner and the scorer of 198 goals - remains open, but it's the biggest decision the club has to make in terms of the squad given his reputation and achievements.\nIt means Leicester must shift big earners to make wholesale changes to a squad which has, in the main, brought them down twice.\nWilfred Ndidi signed a new three-year contract last summer but his appetite for another Championship campaign is likely to have waned and the same will go for defenders Ricardo Pereira and Wout Faes. Although, as part of Leicester's decline, they must find takers.\nGoalkeeper Mads Hermansen has been a rare bright spot and will have his admirers, as will Bilal El Khannouss, despite an underwhelming first season in England, while Winks' situation could depend on Van Nistelrooy's exit. \nLike every club, Profit and Sustainability Rules will be a concern so sales are inevitable and the threat of possibly further action from the EFL remains.\nLeicester escaped a points deduction for a PSR breach in the three years to 30 June 2023, successfully arguing the Premier League had no power to punish them as they were already in the EFL at the time of the charge, and the club remains in talks with the Premier League and EFL.\nYet, they have to fall under some jurisdiction and cannot be left to float.  \nFor now, though, Leicester know they will be a Championship club next season and deep-rooted problems - which pre-date and go beyond Van Nistelrooy - need to be dealt with.\nThey made an immediate return last time they went down in 2023. This time their short-term future is far less certain.",

Or could the outpouring of love between Alexander-Arnold and Liverpool's fans be a lifeline for those hoping the player they call \"the Scouser in our team\" may yet stay?\nQuestions only Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool and Real Madrid will know the answers to. But for now, the celebrating of another special moment in his special Liverpool career will be enough for Reds fans.\nSpeculation regarding his Liverpool future has increased following the new deals signed by Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. But the 26-year-old, after making his 350th appearance for his boyhood club, gave no clues over his intentions. \nHe said: \"I have said all season that I am not going to speak on my situation. I am not going to go into the details.\n\"But days like this are always special. Scoring goals, playing games, winning games, winning titles - they are special moments for me and I am glad to do my part.\"\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot was also guarded, saying: \"My only good answer is to talk about his goal. All the attention should go for that, and all the good things he has done for this club for so many years.\n\"He is incredible if he sets his mind to it. Today he knows when it matters most, he can bring a bit more and that is something only the top, top, top players have.\"\nAn air of inevitability hung heavily over all that played out in the sunshine before Alexander-Arnold scored with 14 minutes left to give Liverpool a 1-0 win and send Leicester City down.\nLiverpool played like a team who knew they will be champions. Leicester City played like a team who knew they would be relegated.

This was a show of glorious unity between supporters and the local boy who has won everything during his Anfield career.\nIt may be those hoping Alexander-Arnold will remain at Liverpool will read more into the celebrations than was there, but it was certainly quite the outpouring.\nWhen he finally ended the defiance of Leicester City keeper Mads Hermansen, it was the 23rd goal of his professional career and the first scored with his left foot.\nAlexander-Arnold responded by ripping off his Liverpool shirt before running towards the corner flag, bellowing in joy at the supporters as he was mobbed by team-mates. He then planted his shirt on the corner flag like a player who had reached his personal Everest.\nIt left Liverpool at the Premier League summit, with the title party set for Anfield against Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday, when three points will complete what has long been a formality. The celebrations may even start earlier depending on the outcome of Arsenal's game at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday.\nAfter the final whistle, Liverpool's players pushed Alexander-Arnold towards the corner where their fans were congregated to take individual acclaim.\nWill it make any difference? Will the sight of those fans tug on Alexander-Arnold's heartstrings or has his head already made the decision to join the Galacticos of Real Madrid?\nFor now, Liverpool's priority is the more immediate one of winning that 20th title, an inevitability for some time.\nSlot said: \"It is never hard to dream, but it is also clear that we are really focused on playing. The boys deserve to have a day off and hopefully they will enjoy that and then focus on Tottenham.\"\nAs for Alexander-Arnold, his future remains undecided - publicly at least - but if this was part of his Liverpool farewell, what a way to go out.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

an area the Bristol Bears fly-half struggled with last Six Nations.\"Holly has put that [goal-kicking issue] to bed and ticked the box that says 'you can't pick me because I can't do that', which is all you can do as a player,\" former England fly-half Katy Daley-McLean told BBC'S Rugby Union Weekly.France enjoy an unstructured game, well-suited for attacking rugby, which may mean Mitchell leans towards kicking control at 10.Scrum-half \u2013 Hunt to hold off Lucy Packer?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Natasha Hunt (left) and Lucy Packer (right)The contest over who will partner the chosen fly-half is also heating up.Natasha Hunt has been Mitchell's go-to starting scrum-half during his tenure, but after a slow start against Ireland, when England led only 7-5 at half-time in Cork, replacement scrum-half Lucy Packer helped speed up the game in a much-improved second-half performance that ended 49-5 in England's favour.Packer was rewarded with a start against Scotland and again showed her fast service as England scored 42 first-half points.Harlequins' Packer impacting the game from the bench, with Hunt's experience from the off, has been the usual play by Mitchell, but he is not shy of a bold selection call.Listen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateEngland set up Grand Slam decider with FranceBack row - experience or in-form youth Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Alex Matthews (left), Maddie Feaunati (centre), Marlie Packer (centre) and Sadia Kabeya (right)Captain Zoe Aldcroft has moved from lock to blind-side flanker this campaign and is the only Red Roses player to start every game.Regular number eight and 2014 World Cup-winner Alex Matthews was suspended for the opening two games, which opened the door for Maddie Feaunati to pick up the player of the match in the opening round, before scoring two tries in Cardiff.Another powerful display against Scotland by the 22-year-old Exeter Chief means Mitchell now has to decide between form and experience.Matthews, 31, picked up player of the match in last year's Grand Slam decider in Bordeaux, and has been Mitchell's reliable big-game player, drawing on her 74 caps of experience.Former England captain Marlie Packer grabbed her 50th England try on Saturday in her 110th cap in a gentle reminder of her importance at open-side flanker.Despite losing the captaincy to Aldcroft in January, the 35-year-old featured against Italy and Scotland this campaign and will hope the experience of captaining England to their past two Grand Slams will go in her favour.Loughborough Lightning's Sadia Kabeya, 23, shone when wearing the seven shirt in the other two games and has an ability to produce big turnovers, such as the one against Wales on England's tryline, as well as linking play in attack.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, England's Packer reacts to victory against ScotlandWing - Breach or MacDonald?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jess Breach (left) and Claudia MacDonald (right)When England won their third Grand Slam in a row last year, their settled back three of Jess Breach, Abby Dow and Ellie Kildunne scored a combined 18 tries.Wing Breach suffered a long-term hip injury in November, ruling the 27-year-old out until February.While Dow and Kildunne have continued their scintillating form of last year, with a combined eight tries this championship, Breach, who has looked dangerous on her return, has yet to score this campaign.Exeter Chiefs' Claudia MacDonald returned to the Red Roses after missing last year's Six Nations following a second neck injury, and backed up her try-scoring return against Italy in round one with two tries and a player-of-the-match performance against Scotland.The 29-year-old, who played in the World Cup final defeat by New Zealand in 2022, has impressed with her high work-rate, sharp footwork and balanced running style.Gloucester-Hartpury wing Mia Venner saw her fine Premiership Women's Rugby form rewarded in round one, but despite scoring and looking dangerous on the ball, the 22-year-old has not been seen since.The relationship Breach has with Kildunne and Dow may tilt the selection in her favour, but MacDonald is now certainly pushing for inclusion.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, MacDonald grabs her second try against Scotland'Fitter and stronger' MacDonald stakes wing spotPublished2 days agoEngland thrash Scotland to set up Grand Slam deciderPublished2 days agoWomen's Six Nations: Fixtures, results & BBC coveragePublished2 days agoDaley-McLean's picks from 7-10Asked for her England starters in the jerseys seven to 10 for the game against France, Daley-McLean told Rugby Union Weekly: \"John Mitchell will look at it as a tactical game and not just pick on just form alone.

        "article_text": "In January, Lina went to the police.\nHer ex-partner had been threatening her at home in the Spanish seaside town of Benalm\u00e1dena. That day, he'd allegedly raised his hand as if to hit her.\n\"There had been violent episodes - she was scared,\" Lina's cousin Daniel recalls.\nWhen she got to the police station, she was interviewed and her case registered with VioG\u00e9n, a digital tool which assesses the likelihood of a woman being attacked again by the same man.\nVioG\u00e9n - an algorithm-based system - asks 35 questions about the abuse and its intensity, the aggressor's access to weapons, his mental health and whether the woman has left, or is considering leaving, the relationship.\nIt then records the threat to her as \"negligible\", \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\" or \"extreme\".\nThe category is used to make decisions about the allocation of police resources to protect the woman.\nLina was deemed to be at \"medium\" risk.\nShe asked for a restraining order at a specialist gender violence court in Malaga, so that her ex-partner couldn't be in contact with her or share her living space.  The request was denied.\n\"Lina wanted to change the locks at her home, so she could live peacefully with her children,\" says her cousin.\nThree weeks later, she was dead. Her partner had allegedly used his key to enter her flat and soon the house was on fire.\nWhile her children, mother and ex-partner all escaped, Lina didn't. Her 11-year-old son was widely reported as telling police it was his father who killed his mother.\nLina's lifeless body was retrieved from the charred interior of her home. Her ex-partner, the father of her three youngest children, was arrested.\nNow, her death is raising questions about VioG\u00e9n and its ability to keep women safe in Spain.\nVioG\u00e9n didn't accurately predict the threat to Lina.\nAs a woman designated at \"medium\" risk, the protocol is that she would be followed up again by a nominated police officer within 30 days. \nBut Lina was dead before that. If she had been \"high\" risk, the police follow-up would have happened within a week.  Could that have made a difference to Lina?\nTools to evaluate the threat of repeat domestic violence are used in North America and across Europe. In the UK, some police forces use DARA (Domestic Abuse Risk Assessment) - essentially a checklist. And DASH (Domestic Abuse, Stalking, Harassment and Honour-based Violence Assessment) may be employed by police or others, like social workers, to assess the risk of another attack.\nBut only in Spain is an algorithm woven so tightly into police practice. VioG\u00e9n was developed by Spanish police and academics.  It's used everywhere apart from the Basque Country and Catalonia (those regions have separate systems, although police co-operation is nationwide).\nThe head of the National Police's family and women's unit in Malaga, Ch Insp Isabel Espejo, describes VioG\u00e9n as \"super-important\". \n\"It helps us follow each victim's case very precisely,\" she says.\nHer officers deal with an average of 10 reports of gender violence a day. And every month, VioG\u00e9n classifies nine or 10 women as being at \"extreme\" risk of repeat victimisation. \nThe resource implications in those cases are huge: 24-hour police protection for a woman until the circumstances change and the risk decreases. Women assessed as \"high\" risk may also get an officer escort.\nA 2014 study found that officers accepted VioG\u00e9n's evaluation of the likelihood of repeated abuse 95% of the time. Critics suggest police are abdicating decision-making about women's safety to an algorithm.\nCh Insp Espejo says that the algorithm's calculation of risk is usually adequate. But she recognises  - even though Lina's case wasn't under her command - that something went wrong with Lina's assessment.\n\"I'm not going to say VioG\u00e9n doesn't fail \u2013 it does. But this wasn't the trigger that led to this woman's murder. The only guilty party is the person who killed Lina. Total security just doesn't exist,\" she says.\nBut at \"medium\" risk, Lina was never a police priority. And did Lina's VioG\u00e9n assessment have an impact on the court's decision to deny her a restraining order against her ex-partner?\nCourt authorities didn't give us permission to meet the judge who denied Lina an injunction against her ex-partner - a woman attacked on social media after Lina's death.\nInstead, another of Malaga's gender violence judges, Maria del Carmen Guti\u00e9rrez tells us in general terms that such an order needs two things: evidence of a crime and the threat of serious danger to the victim.\n\"VioG\u00e9n is one element I use to assess that danger, but it's far from the only one,\" she says.\nSometimes, the judge says, she makes restraining orders in cases where VioG\u00e9n has assessed a woman as at \"negligible\" or \"low\" risk.  On other occasions she may conclude there's no danger to a woman deemed at \"medium\" or \"high\" risk of repeat victimisation.\nDr Juan Jose Medina, a criminologist at the University of Seville, says Spain has a \"postcode lottery\" for women applying for restraining orders \u2013 some jurisdictions are much more likely to grant them than others.  But we don't know systematically how VioG\u00e9n influences the courts, or the police, because studies haven't been done.\n\"How are police officers and other stakeholders using this tool, and how is it informing their decision-making? We don't have good answers,\" he says.\nSpain's interior ministry hasn't often allowed academics access to VioG\u00e9n's data. And there hasn't been an independent audit of the algorithm. \nGemma Galdon, the founder of Eticas \u2013 an organisation working on the social and ethical impact of technology \u2013 says if you don't audit these systems, you won't know if they're actually delivering police protection to the right women.\nExamples of algorithmic bias elsewhere are well-documented.  In the US, analysis from 2016 of a recidivism tool found black defendants were more likely than their white peers to be incorrectly judged to be at higher risk of repeat offending. At the same time, white defendants were more likely than black defendants to be wrongly flagged as low risk.\nIn 2018, Spain's interior ministry didn't give a green light to an Eticas proposal to conduct a confidential, pro-bono, internal audit. So instead, Gemma Galdon and her colleagues decided to reverse-engineer VioG\u00e9n and do an external audit. \nThey used interviews with women survivors of domestic abuse and publicly available information - including data from the judiciary about women who, like Lina, had been killed.\nThey found that between 2003 and 2021, 71 women murdered by their partners or ex-partners had previously reported domestic abuse to the police.  Those recorded on the VioG\u00e9n system were given risk levels of \"negligible\" or \"medium\".\n\"What we'd like to know is, were those error rates that cannot be mitigated in any way? Or could we have done something to improve how these systems assign risk and protect those women better?\" asks Gemma Galdon.\nThe head of gender violence research at Spain's interior ministry, Juan Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez-Ossorio, is dismissive of the Eticas investigation: it wasn't done with VioG\u00e9n data. \"If you don't have access to the data, how can you interpret it?\" he says.\nAnd he is wary of an external audit, fearing it could compromise both the security of women whose cases are recorded and VioG\u00e9n's procedures.\n\"What we know is that once a woman reports a man and she's under police protection, the probability of further violence is substantially lowered - we've no doubts about that,\" says L\u00f3pez-Ossorio.\nVioG\u00e9n has evolved since it was introduced in Spain.  The questionnaire has been refined, and the \"negligible\" category of risk will soon be abolished. And even critics agree it makes sense to have a standardised system responding to gender violence.\nIn Benalm\u00e1dena, Lina's home has become a shrine.\nFlowers, candles and pictures of saints were left on the step. A small poster stuck on the wall declared: Benalm\u00e1dena says no to gender violence. The community fundraised for Lina's children.\nHer cousin, Daniel, says everyone's still reeling from news of her death.\n\"The family it's destroyed \u2013 especially Lina's mother,\" he says.\n\"She's 82 years old. I don't think there's anything sadder than to have your daughter killed by an aggressor in a way that could have been avoided. The children are still in shock \u2013 they'll need a lot of psychological help.\"",

The heroines of films including Sister Midnight, Santosh, Girls Will Be Girls, All We Imagine as Light and Shadowbox are giving international audiences a chance to see female characters from India who differ from most traditional Bollywood heroines. But do Indian audiences want to watch them \u2013 or will they even be able to?\nA feral bride in an arranged marriage that neither she nor the groom particularly want, Uma is the protagonist of Karan Kandhari's spiky comedy Sister Midnight, which premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for a Bafta. Well-known Bollywood actress Radhika Apte, who plays her, is shown struggling with household chores. \"Men are dim,\" her neighbour tells her. \"They'll eat anything. Just add chilli and salt.\" Uma informs her awkward groom, who has gone on a week-long drinking binge, that he \"stinks\" and tells her employers sarcastically when they offer her a cleaning job that she's \"a domestic goddess\".\u00a0\nTold through offbeat dialogue, physical comedy and a punkish soundtrack that includes Iggy Pop, Sister Midnight presents a heroine unlike anything else filmed in India, according to Apte. \"I'd never read anything like it before and I couldn't put it down,\" she tells the BBC. \"I was completely taken by Uma, she was this crazy creature, and I didn't know why I resonated with her, but I just did. It was going to be a very thin line playing her between it being really cool and it going wrong. And that excited and challenged me. I also like how unapologetic Uma is and the more she accepts herself, the freer and stronger she becomes.\" \u00a0\nUma is the latest character that offers a different kind of female protagonist to Indian viewers, one who differs markedly from the traditional Bollywood heroine. \"Bollywood\", the name for Hindi-language studio cinema, has historically dominated the Indian box office, making around $1.36bn last year. But it's also been accused of being \"sexist and regressive\" in its attitude towards women. In 2023, a landmark study in India examined some of the country's biggest hits in terms of gender representation and sexual stereotyping, and found what they described as a \"formula\" to many of Bollywood's female characters.\u00a0\n\"The female lead has to be thin and beautiful. She has to be coy and demure who expresses consent through gestures rather than words, but [she] wears sexually revealing clothing and has to be somewhat modern to allow for her to be in a pre-marital relationship which is a transgression,\" Professor Lakshmi Lingam, the project lead for the study, told the BBC at the time. \"There's very little attempt to do something different.\"\nThe depiction of both male and female characters on screen is important, she added, because \"in India, where families and schools rarely teach about sex education and consent, all our responses are influenced by books and cinema\".\nBy contrast, the male stars of the biggest Bollywood films of 2023 were described as \"led by alpha male protagonists with rippling muscles and blazing guns brandished on screen as they went on a bone-crunching rampage to vanquish their enemies\". The hit films included Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan and Jawan, in which he plays a spy and vigilante, as well as the much-criticised, hyper-violent Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, a film accused of misogyny and objectifying women. It was made by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, whose previous film Kabir Singh showed the male lead openly stalking and harassing a woman and was the second biggest Bollywood movie of 2019.\u00a0\nThere have been hit films showing women in roles of authority, including female rocket scientists in Mission Mangal, also one of the most successful Bollywood films of 2019, and films praised for a modern perspective on gender roles, such as Karan Johar's Rocky aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (Rocky and Rani's Love Story). But nevertheless\u00a0Shubhra Gupta, the film critic for daily newspaper The Indian Express, laments the lack of \"wriggle room\" India's leading ladies generally have in their roles.\n\"These heroines' overriding principle is demureness,\" she tells the BBC. \"You can have flashes of spirit, or you may speak your mind, but you'd also be just right in terms of beauty, and you'd be very clearly subservient to the leading man and whatever he is doing. You are pretty much always bringing up the rear, with a few scenes in which you get to shine.\"\nIn Sandhya Suri's recent drama Santosh, however, a Dalit woman (from the lowest caste in Indian society) is as a police officer, with the authority that brings. Santosh inherits her husband's police officer job when he dies in service, something that's possible on compassionate grounds for government employees in India. Santosh, played by Shahana Goswami, is an enigmatic character who finds corruption in her local police force when a young girl is raped and murdered. She has a female boss, played by film and TV actress Sunita Rajwar, who has learned to compromise to stay at the top.\nSuri, previously a documentary maker, says she was influenced in making it by the real-life gang rape and murder in 2012 of a young woman on a bus in Delhi, which made worldwide headlines and led to new laws to safeguard women. (Despite that, sexual violence against women and girls remains high in India, and a 2022 report found that cruelty by a husband or his relatives remained the biggest crime against Indian women.)\n\"There were big protests at the time [of the rape and murder], and I saw the photo of a female cop being confronted by some very angry female protestors. I saw that image and I saw the expression on the cop's face, and it was so enigmatic that I was just very, very taken by it. It was so interesting. She was at both ends of power. There was the possibility of violence against her, but [it was] also possible for her to mete out violence as well with that uniform,\" Suri tells the BBC.\n\"I wanted to know if you took somebody like Santosh, shut up in the kitchen of her house, and you put her in that place, what's her response to that?\" she explains. \"I wanted to ask if there was a way to be a woman that's not about being a man, and not about being oppressed. Is there some other way in her society in which she can be, and that there may be a line she steps over?\"\nSantosh, which was made in Hindi, was the UK's Oscar entry for best international film in 2025 \u2013 one attribute both Sister Midnight and Santosh share is that, though they were filmed in India, they're made by British Indian film-makers. Sister Midnight's makers hope to release it in India in 2025, but Suri tells the BBC that Santosh will almost certainly not get a cinema release there.\n\"We screened it at the Mumbai International Film Festival and had a great response, and I was moved by just how real the film felt to a local audience,\" she says. \"But it looks like the film won't release in India, sadly, as it was admitted to the censor board (CBFC) and there were so many cuts, I couldn't maintain some semblance of a film.\"\nIndian censorship decisions have frequently caused controversy: in 2017, the decision to ban the feminist Indian movie Lipstick Under My Burkha for being \"too lady oriented\" caused an outcry, and was later overturned after negative publicity. But many homegrown blockbusters are self-censoring, especially when it comes to sex and sexuality.\u00a0\nThe 2021 Telugu-language hit Pushpa: The Rise, the story of a smuggler, removed a scene where the hero Pushpa (played by Allu Arjun) touches the chest of the heroine, Srivalli, because of complaints from the audience. In 2024, Pushpa 2: The Rule again caused controversy in India, according to Shubhra Gupta, because of an insinuation that Srivalli (played by Rashmika Mandanna) might want to be sexually intimate with her husband.\n\"The [female] character acts very cute, she comes on to the hero and is very playful when she wants a little assignation,\" Gupta says of it. \"The rest of the film she's serving the hero. She wants her husband not to have sex with anyone else. But in fact, it became a real talking point in India because it's not something heroes or leading ladies in the movies are supposed to have conversations about.\n\"And our mainstream film experience is still very much that if a woman has a sexual experience outside marriage, there will be some castigation attached to it,\" she adds. \"She won't be 'pure' anymore, she'll be known as 'bold' which means she's been around.\"\u00a0\nIt makes Payal Kapadia's acclaimed film All We Imagine as Light seem more audacious in terms of its exploration of sex. The first ever Indian winner of the Cannes Film Festival's Grand Prix is the story of a nurse, Prabha, who's been abandoned in her arranged marriage. Meanwhile, her younger flatmate Anu, a Hindu, wants to get intimate with her Muslim boyfriend, itself another taboo. There's no talk of marriage in advance.\n\"The film's about the preoccupations I've had for some time,\" Kapadia tells the BBC. \"Women in India can be financially independent, but there is still not a lot of autonomy with what you choose to do with your personal life. It's infantilising women. You could be 25 years old, making your own money, providing for your family back home. But you can't decide who to be with or who to marry.\"\nDespite the accolades, All We Imagine as Light was not chosen as India's 2025 Oscar entry (the deciding jury called it \"a European film taking place in India\".) But it wasn't the only film by an Indian female director in 2024 that put a young woman's sexual awakening on screen \u2013 the English and Hindi language movie Girls Will Be Girls, by Shuchi Talati, won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival. Set in a boarding school in the Himalayas, it's the story of an 18-year-old girl who falls in love with a boy for the first time, but whose romance is disrupted by her mother.\nBut Indian films breaking societal \"norms\" have found international recognition before, from Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding (2001), to Lipstick Under My Burkha (2016), and 2014's LGBTQ+ teenage love story, Margarita with a Straw. Shubhra Gupta says there's still a vast gap between what an international audience react to and what mainstream Indian audiences will pay to see, given the high ticket prices in cinemas.\n\"These films we're talking about are part of independent Indian film, which is really where all the exciting things happen, and that's pretty much true of all world cinema,\" she says. \"Payal Kapadia has had a fabulous journey with All We Imagine as Light, and it did get a cinema release here. But I'm not sure how much box office it made in India.\" She adds that many viewers in India would react in \"disbelief\" to heroines such as Sister Midnight's Uma and Santosh were they able to watch the movies, as they are so unconventional.\n\"They wouldn't be able to suspend disbelief that in Santosh, a Dalit woman from the lower caste, would be made into the lead, that she's driving the narrative. It would be such a hard sell here,\" she says. \"And Radhika Apte's character Uma is a wife, but she is not submissive. She goes out there and does all these mad things. They are excellent films that might do well on a streaming platform, or they will find a discerning audience\u00a0\u2013 but a discerning audience doesn't really make up the numbers that a big budget Bollywood film will.\"\u00a0\nBut Indian film-makers still have to try to break stereotypes for audiences, according to Tanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi, the directors behind Bengali-language film Shadowbox. The film, shown at this year's Berlin International Film Festival, is the story of Maya, (played by Tillotama Shome) who holds down several jobs and battles to keep her family going because her husband, a former soldier, struggles with his mental health and is frequently humiliated by the community because of it.\n\"When we're talking about working class underprivileged women, the term 'from the margins' tends to crop up,\" Das tells the BBC. \"But the 'margin' represents a huge majority of our population. Where are their stories, then? It's high time we broke stereotypes, and to do this more women need to tell their own stories. I feel producers and distributors of film underestimate how large a viewership women represent, and their appetite to see stories where their lives are mirrored rather than projected in a tokenistic way.\"\nIf cinema itself is not an option, the rise of the international streamers and OTT platforms (which allow viewers to watch content directly on their TV or through a phone app) during the Covid-19 pandemic has provided a place for recent, more audacious, female-focused film-making. The Great Indian Kitchen in 2021 by Jeo Baby, a Malayalam language film, became a hit on the app Neestream, and versions of the story were also made in Tamil and Hindi. It's the story of an arranged marriage, and the film shows, from a female viewpoint, household drudgery, unpleasant in-laws and monotonous and painful sex with an uncaring husband, with one female critic saying of it that \"the film rips through patriarchy, the bedrock of the institutions of family and religion.\"\nLaapataa Ladies, by Kiran Rao (which did become India's Oscar entry this year) also deals with an unwanted arranged marriage and was released on Netflix, as was 2020's Gunjan Saxena, which told the story of India's first ever female fighter pilot.\n\"But people are not actually buying a ticket for these,\" Gupta says. \"It's mostly 15-to 35-year-olds who are going to the movies, and often they happen to be young men. And the film industry is still a boy's club to a large extent.\"\u00a0\nFor more nuanced female characters to be seen in big-budget cinema films, ultimately Bollywood's lack of profits last year might be an impetus. After its bumper 2023, last year Bollywood only achieved 40% of the overall Indian box office profits, and Gupta says its \"formulaic films\" are part of the problem. \"People are hungry for something different,\" she says. \"But the problem is, if you take them too far out of their comfort zone, I'm not sure whether they're going to come to the cinema. So unfortunately, we've ended up maintaining this equilibrium so that people will come to the movies not expecting to see women who are feminists, or women who do not ascribe to the idea of what a good woman should be.\"\nHowever, she adds, it's not just female characters who have to be written differently in order for change to come. \"I would say that if you want your women characters to be different, you also have to write your men differently too,\" says Gupta. \"There needs to be a cosmic shift across the board.\"\nSantosh and Sister Midnight are currently on release in the UK. Sister Midnight will be released in the US on 16 May 2025.\n--\nIf you liked this story\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X, and\u00a0Instagram",
