        "article_text": "On Monday afternoon, a federal judge had a simple question for the Trump administration's lawyers: Is tech billionaire Elon Musk the Department of Government Efficiency's administrator?\nThe agency more popularly known as \"Doge\" is Musk's brainchild, but the White House insists that he is not its leader - or even employed by it. \nJustice department lawyer Bradley Humphreys told the judge that: \"I don't have any information beyond he's a close adviser to the president.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt doubled down on this position at a Tuesday press briefing.\n\"The president tasked Elon Musk to oversee the Doge effort,\" she said, but she later added that \"career officials\" and appointees were helping Musk run Doge, and that people who have \"onboarded\" as federal employees were working at various agencies.\nShe declined to provide specific names, but she announced that Musk would attend President Donald Trump's first cabinet secretary meeting alongside the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General and other top US political appointees who were vetted and confirmed by the Senate.\nThe White House later told the BBC that a person named Amy Gleason is the acting administrator. They did not provide additional details about her or when she was appointed. \nMs Gleason declined to comment, CBS News reported.\nMusk has been leading an outside effort to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings.\n\"They're playing a game,\" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service, an organisation that has provided past administrations with procedure and ethics guidance.\n\"If [Musk] were actually the administrator, then this issue about him needing Senate confirmation and his actually having to abide by the conflict of interest laws would be much clearer.\"\nExperts said that Musk has given the impression of being in charge of Doge by staffing the government entity with employees and engineers from his various companies, posting constantly about its work on X, appearing alongside Trump in the Oval Office to promote the cuts it has made to the federal workforce, and representing it on stage at the Conservative Political Action Committee gathering last week while wielding a chainsaw.\n\"We're in Alice in Wonderland right now,\" Mr Stier said. \"We're through the looking glass.\"\nTrump established Doge by renaming the United States Digital Service - an agency focused on digital and web infrastructure - to the United States Doge Service via an executive order.\nThe order establishes Doge's leadership structure, saying that \"there shall be a USDS Administrator\" that reports up to the White House chief of staff.\nIt does not name a specific individual for the role. In fact, Musk's name never appears in the executive order, though Trump has credited his work with the team.\nDoge's arrival has caused turbulence in the existing US Digital Service ranks. The administration fired several staffers there earlier this month, and the Associated Press reported that 21 employees resigned in protest on Tuesday. \nIn a letter to management, they alleged Doge employees were creating \"significant security risks\".\n\"We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,\" their letter stated, according to the AP. \"However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments.\"\nBBC News has reviewed the letter but has not been able to verify its contents.\nA series of lawsuits challenging Doge have slowed some of the administration's effort to cut the federal workforce, and they have forced the Trump White House to face the question of Musk's status in court. \nUntil the  administration stated that Ms Gleason was the acting administrator late on Tuesday, it gave vague answers about Doge's leadership across multiple lawsuits. \nThough she did not rule in the hearing on Monday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly expressed concern about Doge's constitutionality. She noted it might run afoul of the appointment clause of the US Constitution, which sets out nominating procedures for agency leaders.\n\"It does seem to me if you have people that are not authorised to carry out some of these functions that they're carrying out that does raise an issue,\" she said. \n\"I would hope that by now we would know who is the administrator, who is the acting administrator and what authority do they have?\"\nExperts say that Musk's work does not fit the traditional definition of \"special government employee\", which has specific rules.\nThe White House has previously said that Musk \"is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws\". \nWilliam Resh, a professor who studies the executive branch at the University of Southern California, said typically such employees have been hired as advisers for their relative expertise.\n\"But they do not hold distinct executive power the way that a Senate-confirmed appointee would, or even a unilateral permanent appointments that a president can make,\" he said. \nWhile Musk appears to have made several moves regarding the federal workforce largely unencumbered, his recent demand that federal employees list five accomplishments in an email was met with pushback from some Trump-appointed agency leaders.\nThe directive was walked back as optional at some agencies, over concerns staff could reveal sensitive information and that the order violated federal policies.\nAsked whether this showed tension between Doge and Trump's other officials, Leavitt insisted that \"everyone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump\".\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

He proposed doing so by leveraging its resources, including critical minerals and metals, as well as making Canada a \"superpower of clean energy\" and removing trade barriers between provinces.\nHe, too, agreed with Freeland that Trump's second term was different from the first.\n\"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"\nHe added that he would be in favour of imposing dollar-for-dollar tariffs on the US should Trump move ahead with his threat to levy a 25% tax on all Canadian goods starting on 4 March.\nGould, the youngest candidate on the stage, positioned herself as the candidate \"for today and the future\", with a message that homed in on how a Liberal Party under her leadership would work to make life more affordable for Canadians.\nThe candidates also addressed shifting US policy on Ukraine. As the four debated, Trudeau was in Kyiv marking three years since the Russia-Ukraine war began.\nAll four candidates agreed that Canada should continue supporting Ukraine. Freeland suggested that money seized from Russia through sanctions be redistributed to help Ukraine's war effort, while Carney stated that any discussion on Ukraine's future could not happen without the Ukrainians at the table.\nFreeland also suggested that Canada should foster closer ties with Denmark which, she noted. was also facing threats from Trump who has signalled his desire to take over Greenland - a Danish territory.\nFor the second half of the debate, candidates offered up their ideas for how to help Canada reduce its federal budget deficit, tackle crime and increase its military spending.\nThey were also asked about climate change, with both Freeland and Carney saying they no longer supported a carbon tax on consumers - a key climate policy of the Trudeau government that has become unpopular with Canadians.\nAt certain points, candidates also took aim at Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, saying he would be unfit to defend Canada against Trump.\nPoilievre is currently leading in the national polls, though the gap between him and the Liberal Party has narrowed since Trudeau's resignation. The Conservative leader has since focused his attacks on Carney, arguing that a Liberal Party under his leadership would not be different from that under Trudeau.\nMonday's debate is the first of two, with a second, English-language debate slated for Tuesday. Liberal Party members will vote for their next leader on 9 March, after which Trudeau is expected to step down.\nThe French-language debate is especially important for Francophone Canadians in Quebec, whose votes are influential in helping decide which party will form Canada's next government.\nWhoever is elected as leader would become Canada's next prime minister until the next general election, which must be held on or before 20 October.",

It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,\" he recalls.\nMoving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to \u20ac60,000.\nThe money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.\nMr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".\nKeeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.\nIn 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.\nIn 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.\nAfter a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.\nThe proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.\nBut specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.\n\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.\nHe points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations. \nKnown as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.\nThat's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.\n\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.\nMr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.\n\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".\nRita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration. \nAccording to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.\n\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.\nMs de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"\nAntonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree.

Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"\nEven with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.\nNow in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.\n\"But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.\"\nMr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.\n\"Up until today I never thought about it.\"\nMr Dias agrees: \"Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there\".",

        "article_text": "YouTube is about to turn 20. An unusual research method is unveiling statistics about the platform that Google would rather keep hidden.\nYouTube may not seem secretive. It's public facing. You can watch an endless stream of content from now until your dying breath. There's been a mountain of research about the platform, unpacking everything from the commodified economy that surrounds it to the radicalising effects of its algorithm. But the picture goes blurry when you start asking simple questions. For example: how much YouTube do we all watch?\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, is quiet about that and many other details. In February, the company revealed that people who access YouTube on their TVs collectively watch one billion hours a day, but total numbers for the platform are an enigma. Estimates say YouTube has around 2.5 billion monthly users \u2013 almost one in three people on Earth \u2013 and the average mobile app user watches something like 29 hours a month. With that, let's try some back-of-the-napkin maths.\nIf we make a few assumptions, and say that monthly viewing average for app users can be applied across all YouTube users on both the website and television, we can multiply 2.5 billion by 29 hours. This would tell us that humanity consumes something like 8.3 million years of videos on YouTube every month. Over 12 months, that adds up to almost 100 million years, hundreds of times longer than the sum total of human history.\nHow many YouTube videos are there? What are they about? What languages do YouTubers speak? As of 14 February 2025, the platform's will have been running for 20 years. That is a lot of video. Yet we have no idea just how many there really are. Google knows the answers. It just won't tell you.\nExperts say that's a problem. For all practical purposes, one of the most powerful communication systems ever created \u2013 a tool that provides a third of the world's population with information and ideas \u2013 is operating in the dark.\nIn part that's because there's no easy way to get a random sampling of videos, according to Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the US. You can pick your videos manually or go with the algorithm's recommendations, but an unbiased selection that's worthy of real study is hard to come by. A few years ago, however, Zuckerman and his team of researchers came up with a solution: they designed a computer program that pulls up YouTube videos at random, trying billions of URLs at a time.\nYou might call the tool a bot, but that's probably over selling it, Zuckerman says. \"A more technically accurate term would be 'scraper',\" he says. The scraper's findings are giving us a first-time perspective on what's actually happening on YouTube.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn its 20 years of operation, YouTube has shaped entire generations' sensibilities and redefined global culture. Surveys show YouTube is the most popular social media site in the US by far, with 83% of adults and 93% of teenagers among its patrons. It's the second-most-visited website on Earth by most estimates, topped only by Google.com itself. But as the platform enters its third decade, the most basic facts about YouTube are still a closely guarded secret.\nA Google spokesperson shared a blogpost about the platform's recommendation algorithm, but declined to comment on the statistics and other issues mentioned in this story. For now, YouTube's mysteries continue.\n\"It's extremely difficult to get a grasp on what's going on inside social media platforms, because while the companies that operate them do make certain public disclosures, those disclosures are fragmentary and often somewhat misleading,\" says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"I think there's an instinct at Google that it's not in their interest to emphasise just how gargantuan YouTube is, how titanic the number of users, how phenomenal the amount of content. Google doesn't want to be seen as influential as it really is.\"\nBut Zuckerman and his colleagues found a way to peek behind the curtain. YouTube URL's have a standard format. With a few exceptions, the addresses begin with \"youtube.com/watch?v=\" and end with a unique string of 11 characters. Gangnam Style's identifier is 9bZkp7q19f0, for example.\nSo, the researchers wrote a program that basically generates 11 random characters and checks if there's a corresponding video. When the scraper finds one, it downloads it. Zuckerman says you can think of it like a pesky teenager, punching in random numbers for prank calls after dipping into his parent's liquor cabinet.\n\"If I wanted to know how many valid phone numbers there are in New York's 212 area code, I could just dial 212 and seven random numbers to see if somebody answers. I'd probably get cursed out a lot if I did it enough, but eventually I'd gather enough data to figure it out,\" Zuckerman says. \"That's what we did with YouTube. The thing is, YouTube has 18.6 quintillion potential numbers, so you have to dial a few billion before someone picks up.\"\nSo, Zuckerman's lab let the scraper drunk dial YouTube, over and over again, until it put together a big enough data set. To collect the first 10,016 videos they gathered for their initial study, the scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs. It took almost 1.87 billion bad guesses for every real video it found. If you did that work yourself, spending three seconds on each try, it would take an average of 178 years before you landed on a single video.\nWhen the researchers analysed their findings, the results challenged the prevailing narrative about what YouTube actually is.\nThe first question was simple. How many videos have people uploaded to YouTube? Google used to release that statistic in the early days, back when YouTube had something to prove. When Google first acquired the platform in 2006, around 65,000 videos were uploaded every day. More recently the company says more than 500 hours are uploaded per minute, but it's tight-lipped about the number of videos.\nZuckerman and his colleagues compared the number of videos they found to the number of guesses it took, and arrived an estimate: in 2022, they calculated that YouTube housed more than nine billion videos. By mid 2024, that number had grown to 14.8 billion videos, a 60% jump.\nFor many, YouTube brings to mind the faces of bright-eyed influencers vying for money and fame, or professional content creators like MrBeast or Joe Rogan. But the researchers then took a subset of the videos and had human reviewers watch each one to answer a series of questions about what they saw. For the most part, they didn't find the work of professionals.\nOnly 0.21% of the videos they analysed featured any kind of monetisation, such as a sponsorship or an advertisement in the video itself. Less than 4% of the videos included a call to action like YouTube's famous invitations to like, comment and subscribe.\nThose with some kind of set or background design accounted for 14% of videos, while only 38% had undergone any form of editing. More than half of the videos had \"noticeably shaky\" camera work. Only around 18% of videos we're judged to have high quality sound, and the sound quality varied significantly almost 85% of the time. More than 40% had just music, and no speech. About 16% of videos in the sample were primarily still images.\nThe top YouTubers attract audiences in the hundreds of millions, but the researchers estimated the median number of views for a YouTube videos is just 41, and 4% of videos haven't been watched a single time. About 74% of videos have zero comments. Around 89% have no likes. Typical YouTube videos aren't just getting little attention it seems, they're also very short. They assessed that the median YouTube video is only 64 seconds long, and more than a third of videos are less than 33 seconds long.\nYouTube once sold itself as a tool for regular people. The company's early slogan was \"broadcast yourself\". But today, YouTube suggests it's more of a service for people to watch the work of professional creators. In his annual letter at the start of 2025, YouTube's chief executive Neal Mohan said the company's mission is still to \"give everyone a voice\" \u2013 but most of the message was a discussion about how \"YouTubers are becoming the start-ups of Hollywood\" and \"YouTube is the new television\".\nThis narrative misses a critical piece of the picture, says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in Zuckerman's lab, who participated in the scraping project. YouTube is a free service that was built from the ground up by a private company, and it could be argued that Google should be able to run the platform as such. But when you examine how people are actually using YouTube, it looks less like TV and more like infrastructure, McGrady says.\n(To identify languages, the researchers used speech recognition software called Whisper. It paints a fairly accurate picture, but makes occasional errors. For example, Whisper sometimes identifies\u00a0unintelligible sounds as Nynorsk, a written-only language in Norway.)\n\"Most of us imagine YouTube as this place where millionaires give away prizes in a Squid-Game-style contest,\" he says. \"But when you want to have a conversation about YouTube and its place in our society, we need to look at the ways it's used, not just the ways it's consumed.\"\nYouTube is one of the internet's de facto repositories, the first place many of us go when we have videos we want to post or store online. It's also a place where local authority meetings are broadcast, for example, providing a vital opportunity for public accountability in ways that weren't possible before it existed. It isn't just a \"platform\", McGrady says, it's a critical piece of infrastructure, and that's how it should be regulated. \"For companies that own so much of our public sphere, there are some minimum expectations we should have about transparency.\"\nGoogle is dealing with more regulatory pressure than ever before. The company has faced multiple cases across the globe accusing it of running illegal monopolies in several industries. Google has lost several of them, and is currently fighting a number of other antitrust lawsuits.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The ghosts of India's TikTok\n\u2022\u00a0Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n\u2022\u00a0The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\nBut YouTube has escaped much of the scrutiny that's challenged its biggest social media competitors, according to Barrett of New York University. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk make frequent, loud pronouncements about how they do business and what's happening on their platforms. \"Google, in contrast, has largely stayed out of the crossfire by choosing a strategy of being much quieter, a strategy I'd say has largely worked for them,\" he says.\n\"Social media is an anomaly when it comes to how little companies need to explain themselves if you compare it to other industries like finance, or agriculture or even broadcasting,\" Barrett says. \"But social media companies are fundamental players not just in mass communication but in all matters of political and civic life.\"\nThe most important thing to understand is the inner workings of YouTube's algorithm, a system that has astronomical power over the distribution of information all over the world, Barrett says. But simple details about what happens on the platform are important as well. \"It would be very valuable to know all of the facts that are currently so shrouded and unavailable. They are the building blocks of doing deeper research,\" he says. \"It only takes you so far, but you've got to start someplace. The more basic information we have to assess, the healthier the public debate about the role of social media in society will be.\"\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

        "article_text": "Imagine waking up in Rome 2,000 years ago, on the Nile in ancient Egypt or on the streets of London during the Black Death in the 1300s - complete with realistic sights, sounds and daily struggles.\nIn recent weeks, AI-generated videos showing the points of view of people waking up in different historical time periods have gone viral on TikTok.\nDan and Hogne are the creators behind two of the accounts - POV Lab and Time Traveller POV. \nDan, based in the UK, tells the BBC he creates these videos as the \"idea of seeing the past through a first-person perspective felt like a unique way to bring history to life\". \nHogne, a 27-year-old from Norway, adds that his videos are teaching people \"about cool parts of history and helping them learn something new\".\nDespite the videos offering millions a window into history, a number of historians have shared concerns about the accuracy of the content and whether AI can truly resurrect the past, or are we just seeing a polished, modernised version of history designed for engagement?\nMurky and misty streets, coughing townsfolk, and the distant toll of a plague doctor's bell all feature in Hogne's most-watched video, which has racked up 53 million views.\nIt has sparked fascination among many, but historian Dr Amy Boyington describes the medieval-themed video as \"amateurish\" and \"evocative and sensational\" rather than historically accurate.\n\"It looks like something from a video game as it shows a world that is meant to look real but is actually fake.\"\nShe points out inaccuracies like the depiction of houses with large glazed windows and a train track running through the town which wouldn't have existed in the 1300s. \nHistorian and archaeologist Dr Hannah Platts has also noticed significant inaccuracies in a video depicting the eruption of Mount Vesuvius at Pompeii.\n\"Due to Pliny the Younger's eyewitness account of the eruption, we know that it didn't start with lava spewing everywhere so to not use that wealth of historical information available to us feels cheap and lazy.\"\nShe also spots smaller mistakes - stemmed wine glasses and pepper mills didn't exist and people would be reclining while eating not sitting on dining chairs. \n\"The bread roll in the video is a modern loaf and given we actually have carbonised loaves from the time it's a real shame the person making the video didn't do some research and include that.\" \nDan, who created the video of Pompeii, says he recognises a lots of details in his videos are historically inaccurate.\n\"AI-generated content isn't perfect, and while I strive for accuracy, these videos are more about evoking the feeling of a time period rather than being a 100% factual recreation. \n\"They're more like artistic interpretations rather than strict documentaries.\"\nBut, Dr Boyington worries about the impact that these artistic interpretations can have on rewriting history.\n\"It can be quite dangerous as people could manipulate history - for example, someone could create an AI-generated video that backs up holocaust deniers.\"\nWhile most people will know that the content of the video isn't real, the concern is for \"young people who will learn about a historical time period for the first time through these videos\".\nDan rejects these claims and says his videos \"are not meant to be taken as pure historical fact\".\n\"I encourage viewers to research history themselves if they're interested. I see these videos as a way to spark curiosity about the past rather than replace real historical education.\"\nHogne says he feels \"a responsibility\" in creating these videos and has been focusing on trying to make the videos as accurate as possible, \"especially now that so many millions of people are watching them\".\nDr Platts worries about misinformation spreading unchecked, noting that some viewers in the comments seemed unaware that the AI-generated videos were not based on historical facts.\n\"We see lots of students now using AI, and what's problematic is if they see something like this and then it's echoed back to us as if it's fact.\"\nDan says he ensures all his videos are labelled as AI-created, while Hogne says that misinformation has existed long before AI and \"people have to think critically about everything they are watching\".\nAll the historians the BBC spoke to agree that there are merits to Dan and Hogne's videos.\nDr Boyington says they can act as a \"gateway into history and can inspire someone to do their own research\", while a professor of Egyptology, Elizabeth Frood, says that \"if done accurately and reliably then this is of immense benefit to the public as it raises interest and awareness of history\".\nBarbara Keys, a professor of US history at Durham University, took a look at an AI-generated video of someone working at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on 6 April 1986, the day the reactor exploded.\nWhile she sees the potential merits in these videos, she calls the clip a \"black box\" as there's no source information or transparency about what information was fed to the AI programme.\nShe says a concerning inaccuracy in the video is that the reactor is based on images from after the disaster rather than before.\n\"This makes people think that Soviet technology was really bad when actually it was very sophisticated.\"\nShe thinks the viral nature of these videos is less about their historical content and more about the public's fascination with AI itself.\n\"There's nothing very interesting in the video, and it doesn't give you any information about the accident or what happened after, so the interest must be about what AI can do.\" \nProf Frood has concerns that the videos haven't been created accurately or reliably and emphasises that historical reconstructions should be based on extensive research and verifiable sources.\n\"We need to be critical of this video as we know nothing about its source or what information was fed to the AI in order for this video to be created.\"\nShe is commenting specifically on a video about being a child in Egypt in 1250 BC.\nThe first thing that struck her was how the videos tend to \"homogenise complex ancient worlds.\"\n\"Egypt spans thousands of years, and people might not realise that this is just one snapshot,\" she explains. \nOverall she says the video seemed \"poorly researched\" and pointed out an instance where a teacher in a school scene is reading the hieroglyphs backward when they should be read from right to left.\nHogne, who created the video, says he recognises that there are historical inaccuracies in his videos and that's because \"AI can make a lot of errors but in the future the tools will get better\". \n\"I try and spot them where I can but I am not a history expert so I don't always see the error, especially when it's something small,\" he adds. \nAsked about the lack of transparency in source material, Hogne says in the future he might consider adding links to where he got his information from.\n\"It would be cool to make it totally accurate using the right sources, but it's just me on my own making these videos and it takes eight hours to make each one.\" \nHogne relies on Chat GPT to research a time period and asks it for information about what people and places would have looked like. He then generates an initial image of someone looking out at a landscape and from there \"it's a lot of back and forth to get it right\". \nDan says it takes him four hours to make each video and he uses \"different AI tools to generate high-quality images, animate them, and craft realistic sound\".\nHe watches videos and reads documents to educate himself on a time period before making the video to try and give it \"some historical accuracy\".\n\"You have to give the AI every detail, from 'traditional Italian robes' to 'cobblestone floors' otherwise it will get creative and make random things you don't want.\"",

        "article_text": "If Demi Moore wins the best actress award for The Substance, it will be a landmark moment \u2013 outstanding performances in the horror genre are too often overlooked. Could that be set to change?\nIn 2024's The Substance, irresistible temptation leads to unthinkable transformation. The gory flick includes all the hallmarks of a classic horror film: monsters, blood and an uneasy sense of suspense that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Even come the literal bloodbath finale, it's hard to look away.\nThis article contains spoilers for The Substance.\nLove it or hate it, Coralie Fargeat's grotesque, fairytale-gone-wrong is one of the year's breakout films, starring Demi Moore as Elisabeth Sparkle, a former film star who gets fired from her current gig as a celebrity aerobics instructor as she turns 50. While critics and movie-goers agree that The Substance was one of the year's most arresting box-office hits \u2013 rating the film 89% and 75% on Rotten Tomatoes, respectively \u2013 it wasn't until Moore won the Golden Globe for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture \u2013 musical or comedy that murmurs about an awards sweep began to crescendo. Could a by-the-book scary, fantastical horror film win big at this year's Oscars? It is nominated in five categories, including best picture and best actress for Moore.\nSo perhaps The Substance isn't a classic horror film at all. The horror-comedy, deemed a \"feminist masterpiece\" by some, hinges on a familiar premise with a grotesque twist: what would happen if we got everything we wanted after all? After Elisabeth takes a mysterious lime-green \"substance\", she gives birth to a younger, bouncier version of herself \u2013 but not without this process taking a toll on the middle-aged celebrity's body. The film is an especially prescient take on womanhood, beauty and ageing in today's image-obsessed culture. Moore herself has touched upon why the acclaim from this film has meant so much to her, sharing that her Golden Globe win was the first time she \"ever won anything as an actor\" in a career spanning more than 45 years.\nA win for her at this year's Oscars, coupled with her first nomination in a five-decade career, would be momentous. But it would be an even bigger moment if The Substance won best picture \u2013 it is one of only seven horror films ever nominated for the award, and if it won, it would become one of only of two to do so.\u00a0\nDemi Moore has explicitly mentioned the lack of recognition and accolades that horror films (and the people who make them) receive from the awards system and the wider establishment. While accepting her award for best actress at the 2025 Critic's Choice Awards for her performance in The Substance, Moore told the audience: \"I am so grateful, not just for my performance, but that you have highlighted this film, this genre. Normally, horror films are overlooked, and not seen for the profundity that they can hold.\" With this year's awards season, there seems to be a cultural shift happening, and Moore may be at the forefront of change.\nIt's been 33 years since the first (and last) film in the horror genre, The Silence of the Lambs, took the top prize. The 1992 film won best picture, as well as best adapted screenplay, best director (Jonathan Demme), best actor (Anthony Hopkins), and best actress (Jodie Foster). In a league of its own, The Silence of the Lambs is also only one of three films to ever sweep the \"big five\" categories (along with It Happened One Night and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). While no other horror film has ever taken home best picture, a few great horror acting turns have been awarded throughout the years, most notably Ruth Gordon in 1969 for Rosemary's Baby, Kathy Bates in 1991 for Misery, and Natalie Portman in 2011 for Black Swan.\u00a0\nAnd yet, for every stupendous and skin-crawling performance recognised by the Academy, there were many, many more snubbed; recognition for horror acting remains rare, relative to performances in other genres. Despite Ari Aster's Hereditary (2018) receiving 52 award wins and 113 nominations according to IMDB, including numerous accolades for star Toni Collette, neither she nor the film as a whole earned a single nomination at the 2019 Oscars or Golden Globes. Director and horror academic Rebekah McKendry underscores why Collette's performance was so captivating: \"She embodied so much in that film, and all of it was brilliant\u00a0\u2013 a stressed-out mum in mid-life crisis; the trauma of losing a parent and then a child, being the victim of something otherworldly she can't fully explain, and then shifting to becoming the monster herself.\"\u00a0\nFilm critics and fans over the years have agreed that there's one main reason for the widespread snubbing of horror actors \u2013 a prejudice against the genre. \"Many people disregard horror films as b-grade, campy and silly,\" McKendry tells the BBC. \"Because of this, many people don't view horror films as sources of art and social messages. It's a genre many audiences are afraid to approach in general, let alone celebrate with major awards.\" In The Substance, the message about societal pressures on women is clear, which may well boost the film's chances of being rewarded by the Academy.\nIndeed, the evidence suggests Oscars do enjoy horror films with a strong social message \u2013 see 2017's spooky satire Get Out, for which Jordan Peele became the first black person to win the award for best original screenplay. (The film was also nominated that year for best actor, best director, and best picture.)\nIt may also partly explain the Oscar snub for\u00a0Lupita Nyong'o's acclaimed performance\u00a0in the 2019 horror film\u00a0Us, also directed by Jordan Peele. History had been made with his win for Get Out, and though Us can be analysed through themes of class in the US, it did not have nearly as much overt social commentary.\u00a0\nFilm critic\u00a0Kim Newman\u00a0believes that a great horror film is one that resonates with the general public, becoming \"part of the general conversation or lasting pop culture\". But he adds that the best horror films also tend to be \"divisive\" \u2013 and therefore even the most arresting films won't get votes from the many people who hate them. \"Horror kind of needs to be edgy, and that's not often where awards go,\" Newman tells the BBC.\nWhen it comes to horror acting, meanwhile, there is no doubt that it can push performers to their limits in a way that deserves more recognition. Acting coach Scott Sedita highlights the intense physicality behind many great horror performances. Citing Vera Farmiga's performance in 2013 horror The Conjuring as an example, Sedita tells the BBC, \"There was a certain skill in [her] screams \u2013 there's a lot of energy.\" A great horror performance often requires an actor not only to tap very strongly into the viewer's emotions, but also show great stamina and lack of vanity in putting themselves through the wringer in ways that enhance the viewers' sensory experience. While many viewers can relate to Elisabeth Sparkle's emotional scenes of body dysmorphia early on, it's Demi Moore's evolution into an elderly, disfigured version of her character where the film really takes flight.\nAfter attempting to put an end to her younger alter ego with a termination serum, things then really go haywire for Elisabeth, with the emergence of Monstro ElisaSue \u2013 a colossal, grotesque mashup of the two main characters. The prosthetics at this point in the film are definitely ridiculous \u2013 including a revolting excess of teeth, breasts and eyes \u2013 but the absurdity drives home the point of the film. Beauty standards are arbitrary and absurd. We should laugh at them, instead of choosing to fulfil them with extreme and dangerous measures. The Substance is a cautionary tale that points a mirror at the viewer when we find ourselves looking at Monstro ElisaSue in disgust: is she the monster, or am I, for thinking that way? It's extremely difficult to balance horror film acting while trying to connect with the audience \u2013 something many fail to do successfully. The fact that so many moviegoers empathised with Elisabeth's final form is a testament to the performance.\nSo where does the genre go next? Should every horror film moving forward try to appease the masses, or stick to innovative storytelling that continues to shock and awe? The answer may lie in the genre's only best picture Oscars winner, and the films thematic diversity. No one can deny that The Silence of the Lambs belongs in the horror genre \u2013 however, film scholars frequently point out that the movie was sometimes labelled something else. \"What we often see happen is that when a horror film does garner upper-level achievements, its genre in media coverage will shift,\" McKendry says. \"In the case of Silence of the Lambs, it was sometimes called a 'crime film' instead of horror.\" While the difference between horror, thriller, crime and action might sound like splitting hairs, expanding the categorisation of a film can alter its perception in the mainstream \u2013 and propel it to award-winning status.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Inside the doping deal for tennis' world number one\nHe has won the past two Grand Slams - but less than a month after his Australian Open victory Jannik Sinner is the talk of tennis, after agreeing a doping deal which has seen him banned for three months.\nThe timing means the men's world number one will be back for the next major - the French Open. Convenient, critics say.\nThe controversial agreement between the Italian's legal team and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) officials has prompted accusations of favouritism and led to some players questioning their faith in clean sport.\nBut what really happened behind the scenes? And what impact might this case have on anti-doping?\nBBC Sport has spoken to key figures involved to establish the inside story - from the timing of the ban being \"compelling\" to the \"struggle\" of convincing Sinner to bear any ban at all when it was accepted he did not intend to cheat.\nLittle over a week ago, Sinner was practising in Doha as he prepared to play in the Qatar Open.\nBut he knew things might change quickly.\nBehind the scenes there were discussions that would rule him out of that tournament - and the next few months on tour.\nIn what ended up being a \"late night\" on 14 February, Sinner's lawyer Jamie Singer was deep in phone calls with Wada's most senior lawyer.\nThen, early the following morning, the surprise news emerged that the three-time Grand Slam champion had accepted an immediate three-month ban.\nSinner and Wada announced they had \"entered into a case resolution agreement\" over his two failed drugs tests last March.\nThis is a special mechanism that has been in place for the past four years and allows deals to be agreed to conclude doping cases.\n\"It all happened unbelievably quickly,\" Singer told BBC Sport. \"In a matter of a couple of days, really.\"\nSinner finished top of the men's world rankings in 2024 after a remarkable season where he won the Australian Open, US Open, the season-ending ATP Finals, five other ATP titles, and helped Italy win the Davis Cup\nHow do you persuade the world number one player to accept a ban for something he believes he is innocent of?\nThat was the challenge facing Sinner's team.\nTo understand the extent of that we have to rewind to August when an independent tribunal cleared him of wrongdoing.\nIt accepted Sinner's explanation that traces of clostebol - a banned anabolic steroid - had entered his system through inadvertent contamination from his physio during a massage.\nWada, while not challenging the tribunal's overall decision, appealed against the panel's ruling that Sinner \"bore no fault or negligence\".\nHowever, this would have carried a ban of \"one to two years\" at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). \nAlthough Wada initially called for this punishment publicly, eventually its officials came to feel this would not be the right outcome.\nWith time ticking before the Cas hearing in April, Wada made two approaches to Sinner's team for the case resolution agreement.\nThe first attempt was rebuffed as Sinner's team wanted to submit the full defence case first.\nThat was handed over on 31 January, and in early February the first \"concrete discussions\" began after the second approach.\nBut with Sinner always sure of his innocence and confident he would face no ban, would he accept a three-month suspension?\nHis lawyer Singer said it was \"quite tricky\" to convince Sinner to take the offer.\n\"When I was saying 'well, look, maybe we should settle for three months', he was saying 'well, why would we do that if the first independent tribunal found it was no ban at all, why would I accept three months now?',\" Singer said.\n\"My advice was 'one never knows what's going to happen at a hearing, we know that Wada are pushing for a year, if we don't accept their offer then they will go to court looking for a year and who knows what those three judges could do'.\n\"So the possibility of three months, in my view, was a good possibility.\"\nWada felt the independent tribunal should have punished Sinner for strict liability - that he was ultimately responsible for failing the two drugs tests.\nIts officials felt pursuing a suspension was key in defending the \"important principle that athletes do in fact bear responsibility for the actions of their entourage\".\nSo why was Wada happy to offer Sinner a three-month ban?\nWada's general counsel Ross Wenzel said there wasn't a \"fundamental change\" in how the agency viewed the case, but it came down to what it considered fair.\n\"This was a case that was a million miles away from doping,\" Wenzel told BBC Sport.\n\"The scientific feedback that we received was that this could not be a case of intentional doping, including micro-dosing.\"\nHad the case gone to Cas, the outcome would have either been a ban of at least a year or Sinner being cleared.\n\"I'm not sure that a sanction of 12 months in this case - if we'd have forced the tribunal into that position - or a case of 'no fault' would have been a good outcome,\" said Wenzel.\n\"One would have compromised an important principle under the code. The other one, in our view, would have been an unduly harsh sanction.\"\nCase resolutions have been allowed since 2021, and Wenzel said Wada had since struck 67 agreements.\nThe code is set to change from 2027, meaning cases where players have failed tests but were deemed not to be at fault - like Sinner - could be punished from a reprimand to a two-year ban.\n\"In two years, Sinner would simply have had a slap on the wrist,\" one source from an anti-doping organisation told BBC Sport.\nBy winning last month's Australian Open, Sinner became only the eighth player in the Open era to win each of his first three Grand Slam men's singles finals\nSome top players continue to believe Sinner has been given preferential treatment because of his status.\nBoth the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) and Wada flatly reject any suggestion that is the case.\nBut it is clear Sinner - and five-time women's major champion Iga Swiatek, who received a one-month suspension last year after testing positive for heart medication trimetazidine - have benefitted from being able to pay top lawyers to act quickly.\n\"A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair,\" said 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic.\n\"It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers.\"\nSinner's lawyer said he thought the swift resolution of the case came down to taking an \"unusual\" legal approach.\n\"From day one [Jannik] didn't challenge the science, he didn't challenge the test, didn't challenge the rules,\" Singer told BBC Sport.\n\"He accepted, even though it's a trace - it's a billionth of a gram - he accepted that he was liable for what was in his body.\n\"And so we didn't waste time and money on all of those challenges, which traditionally defence attorneys would throw the kitchen sink at.\n\"We just focused on the evidence of what actually happened, and when we did that we managed to do that very quickly and demonstrate very plausibly what had happened.\"\nSinger was also aware that the timing of the ban was as good as it could possibly be.\n\"We can't get away from the fact that you can't choose when these things happen,\" he said.\n\"So the fact that Wada approached us and in the next three months there are no Grand Slams, that seemed to me to make their offer more compelling.\"\nSeveral players believe the timing was suspiciously convenient, with Britain's Liam Broady saying it had impacted Sinner's career as \"little as possible\".\nAsked directly why the deal had come about now, Wenzel insisted it was not taken with the tennis calendar in mind.\n\"Because of the timing of the Cas proceedings, it happened to be decided on 14 or 15 February, whatever it was, last Friday,\" said Wenzel. \"It was a very late night, and it came into effect immediately, so that is the reason for the timing.\"\nThe Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) - an organisation co-founded by Djokovic which aims to increase player power - believes there is a lack of \"transparency\", \"process\" and \"consistency\" in the system.\n\"Supposed case-by-case discretion is, in fact, merely cover for tailored deals, unfair treatment, and inconsistent rulings,\" the PTPA said in a statement.\n\"It's time for change.\"\nThree-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka, writing on social media, said he did not \"believe in a clean sport anymore\".\n'Sad day for tennis' - Sinner doping ban 'leaves sour taste'\nAre there different approaches to tennis doping cases? \nWhat happens next for Sinner after doping case?\nThis week, BBC Sport bought Trofodermin over the counter in an Italian pharmacy - the warning that it contains a drug on Wada's banned list was clearly visible\nAnother talking point has centred around why Sinner's former physio and trainer - who were both deemed responsible for clostebol entering the player's system - have not faced any action from the authorities.\nPhysio Giacomo Naldi was treating a cut on his own hand using a popular over-the-counter spray provided by fitness trainer Umberto Ferrara.\nTrofodermin is readily available in Italy for skin abrasions, cuts and wounds.\nIt contains Clostebol, a steroid that can build muscle mass and enhance athletic performance.\nNeither Naldi nor Ferrara were found by the independent tribunal to have intentionally acted to break doping rules.\nAccording to Italian law, the packaging on Trofodermin must have a visible \"doping\" warning. \nOver the past few years several Italian athletes - across tennis, football and athletics - have tested positive for clostebol.\nSinner has since parted ways with Naldi and Ferrara, but players, including Broady, have publicly questioned how the entourage of one of the world's leading players could have made such a mistake.\nWhile Sinner serves his ban, Ferrara is continuing to work on the ATP Tour with another Italian player, former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini.\nSinner is allowed to return to competitive action on 5 May - just days before the Italian Open begins in Rome, and ahead of the French Open at the end of the month.\nFrom now until 13 April, Sinner can practise at a private training base, if he does not come into contact with other professional players.\nUnder Wada rules, he can start 'official training activity' from 13 April.\nSinner is not allowed to attend any ATP, WTA or ITF events in any kind of capacity until the ban is lifted on 5 May.\nSince the news of his ban emerged a week ago, Sinner, who lives in Monte Carlo and has family in northern Italy where he grew up, was said by a member of his team to have been \"resting\" as he takes stock of the situation.\nIf he returns at the Italian Open, Sinner will likely receive a hero's reception from the home fans who idolise him.\n\"Most tennis fans here think the ban is absurd and are still supporting him. 'Sinner-mania' has not wavered,\" Italian journalist Daniele Verri told BBC Sport.\nWhether he will receive that type of support at Roland Garros remains to be seen.\nThe mood within the locker room could also be frosty, given the sceptical public reaction from many.\nHowever, a source close to Sinner said he had also received support from some of his fellow ATP players, pointing to the public comments made by the likes of Jack Draper, Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Sonego.\nAsked if Sinner was aware of - and upset by - the negative reaction from some players, the team member pointed to Sinner's repeated comments that he \"cannot control what people think or say\".\n\"Jannik is a very resilient young man, and in his own mind he knows he's done absolutely nothing wrong and the process has been absolutely by the book. So I think he's very comfortable in himself,\" Singer told BBC Sport.\n\"He keeps off social media where there are an awful lot of people with a platform, and who don't necessarily know the facts of the case, or investigate the facts of the case as much as they might do.\"\nWada believes the Sinner case has shown the system is working.\nBut it cannot duck the reality that, for as much as everyone involved might insist this case has been handled by the book, it has left some people feeling very uneasy.\nThe full fallout and ramifications of the deal may well leave a cloud hanging over the rest of the season.",

Although Wada initially called for this punishment publicly, eventually its officials came to feel this would not be the right outcome.With time ticking before the Cas hearing in April, Wada made two approaches to Sinner's team for the case resolution agreement.The first attempt was rebuffed as Sinner's team wanted to submit the full defence case first.That was handed over on 31 January, and in early February the first \"concrete discussions\" began after the second approach.But with Sinner always sure of his innocence and confident he would face no ban, would he accept a three-month suspension?His lawyer Singer said it was \"quite tricky\" to convince Sinner to take the offer. \"In two years, Sinner would simply have had a slap on the wrist,\" one source from an anti-doping organisation told BBC Sport.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, By winning last month's Australian Open, Sinner became only the eighth player in the Open era to win each of his first three Grand Slam men's singles finalsBacklash on the tour from playersSome top players continue to believe Sinner has been given preferential treatment because of his status.Both the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) and Wada flatly reject any suggestion that is the case.But it is clear Sinner - and five-time women's major champion Iga Swiatek, who received a one-month suspension last year after testing positive for heart medication trimetazidine - have benefitted from being able to pay top lawyers to act quickly. \"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sinner finished top of the men's world rankings in 2024 after a remarkable season where he won the Australian Open, US Open, the season-ending ATP Finals, five other ATP titles, and helped Italy win the Davis Cup'Tricky to persuade Sinner to accept deal'How do you persuade the world number one player to accept a ban for something he believes he is innocent of?That was the challenge facing Sinner's team.To understand the extent of that we have to rewind to August when an independent tribunal cleared him of wrongdoing.It accepted Sinner's explanation that traces of clostebol - a banned anabolic steroid - had entered his system through inadvertent contamination from his physio during a massage.Wada, while not challenging the tribunal's overall decision, appealed against the panel's ruling that Sinner \"bore no fault or negligence\".However, this would have carried a ban of \"one to two years\" at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). \"I'm not sure that a sanction of 12 months in this case - if we'd have forced the tribunal into that position - or a case of 'no fault' would have been a good outcome,\" said Wenzel.",

        "article_text": "Several old fossil fuel wells in the north of England \u2013 including one that runs 3km deep \u2013 were going to be used for fracking. Instead, they may be a template for the UK's geothermal industry.\nAs the police moved in, Mike Potter gritted his teeth. It seemed to him that he and his fellow protesters were being \"kettled\" \u2013 surrounded by police and constrained from moving. \"No fracking here!\", the demonstrators chanted, gripping their colourful placards.\nFracking, the process of injecting fluid deep into subterranean rock to force out natural gas, emerged during the US Civil War in the 1860s and was first used commercially in the late 1940s. By the 1970s, it had arrived in the UK; over the next 30 years, around 200 gas wells were fracked across the country. But, aside from the question of contributing to further carbon emissions, fracking is potentially dangerous, as it can sometimes trigger earthquakes or contaminate groundwater.\nIn 2016, the prospect of it came to the tiny village of Kirby Misperton in the north of England, close to Potter's home. That year, a local council granted the energy firm Third Energy planning permission to begin fracking at the site.\n\"I thought, until all these people, governments and companies, can actually prove to me that they can and will do this safely,\" recalls Potter, \"I'm going to be anti-fracking.\"\nIt was a risk. He had a government job with security clearance \u2013 if police arrested him, it could have been highly damaging to his career. In the end, widespread opposition to fracking led to the UK government banning the practice in England in 2019.\nPotter and his fellow protestors were relieved. But questions remained \u2013 namely, what was going to happen to the would-be fracking site, a roughly rectangular patch of ground packed with industrial equipment and surrounded by North Yorkshire fields?\nFor years, deep boreholes had yielded gas here, but that gas is now depleted. (And this explains Third Energy\u2019s previous attempts to repurpose the wells for fracking, to squeeze some more gas out of the site.) Now, the firm, acquired in 2024 by renewables company CeraPhi Energy, says it has a new and very different idea: geothermal energy.\nAround the world, many different forms of geothermal energy are in use. Iceland, for instance, gains a significant portion of its heating needs from geothermal. Its engineers have long worked on a project to tap into the searing heat of an underground volcano to generate electricity.\nBut geothermal potential also lies in less geologically active places. And old oil wells, sometimes multiple kilometres deep, can reach underground regions that are naturally warm. The deeper you go, the hotter the rocks tend to be.\nIn the approach proposed by Third Energy, known as closed-loop geothermal, a sealed, water-filled loop is sunk deep inside former oil or gas wells to absorb the naturally occurring heat at their bases. The warmed water in the loop then returns to the surface. In this way, the heat can be passed to nearby buildings.\nUnlike fracking, there is no forcing of fluid into the adjacent rock. \"You're not touching the geology at all,\" says Russell Hoare, managing director at Third Energy. \"You're just putting a small tube on the inside of the well.\"\nThe deepest well at Kirby Misperton, dubbed KM8, descends for 3km (1.9 miles). In tests, the temperature at the well's base was even hotter than Third Energy expected \u2013 around 115C (240F), rather than the anticipated 90C (190F) or so. Early experiments by Third Energy suggested that the system could maintain a steady temperature of around 42C (108F) at the surface. Heat pumps would boost this heat supply further, if necessary, before passing it on to local homes.\n\"That well, if it was configured properly, could probably provide enough heat for 100 homes,\" says Hoare.\nHoare also says that Third Energy has a total of 12 wells it could use for geothermal energy in Yorkshire, three of them at Kirby Misperton. \"What this gives me is potentially another 25-plus years' life out of those wells,\" he adds, explaining that the firm is keen to drill additional wells locally to expand their future network of geothermal boreholes, if possible.\nThe process isn't cheap. Even for a well half the depth of KM8, it could cost up to \u00a31m ($1.3m) to drill and fit it with the water loop equipment. But there's a big potential pay-off, says Hoare: the wells might provide heat for many years, practically without interruption, so long as the resource is maintained by occasionally topping up the underground heat. This could be achieved by periodically sending hot water down the loop within the well to raise the temperature of the geology below.\nFormer protestors like Potter scrutinised Third Energy's proposals. Many were initially sceptical of the plans. But after witnessing a demonstration of how the system might work, Potter says, \"I was absolutely blown away.\" He now volunteers on behalf of Third Energy and has canvassed local organisations and businesses, from schools to a nearby swimming pool, to find out how much heat energy they need and whether they might be able to make use of a future geothermal supply.\nFellow former protestor and local resident Hazel Winter, a teaching assistant, is also gung-ho for the new idea. \"It's all for the good, it's a complete turnaround,\" adds Winter. \"It helps them keep fossil fuels in the ground and it could be the template for a whole new industry.\"\nPotter recalls marvelling at the system \u2013 heat drawn out of the ground and yet no disruption to the rock or soil below. \"I was looking at this thinking, 'This is just too good to be true \u2013 what's the catch?'\" he says.\nHowever, there may be one, according to Gioia Falcone, an expert in geothermal energy at the UK's University of Glasgow. In particular, she is highly sceptical of Third Energy's claim that KM8 alone could potentially provide enough heat for 100 British homes. \"I doubt very much that even if all 12 boreholes were fitted with this concept that they could be heating 100 homes,\" she says.\nIn a conference paper delivered in February 2025, Falcone and colleagues presented an analysis of the KM8 well's potential. They found that KM8 might not stay as hot as hoped. As heat is drawn out of the well, the temperature in the surrounding geology will drop over time, they say. The team calculates that the output temperature may ultimately be limited to 21.8C (71.2F), which would result in only enough heat energy to supply a maximum of 19 homes, if each home uses around 11,200 KWh annually.\nHoare says the paper is \"flawed\" because Falcone and her colleagues did not have full access to all the data the company has collected about the functioning of the well system \u2013 such as the steady state temperature the well has achieved, which is higher than the one calculated by the researchers. He also says that the system would perform best with multiple heat pumps at each residential user's property, which the paper does not appear to consider. As a result, he says, the three wells could supply much more energy than the paper's estimate \u2013 6,900,000 kWh over 12 months, or enough for a few hundred homes each requiring 10,000 kWh, allowing for some losses in the distribution of that heat.\nFleur Loveridge at the University of Leeds in the UK, who specialises in underground energy systems, says there are examples of closed-loop borehole heat exchangers that have produced significant amounts of heat. There is one in Germany, for instance, which researchers say has a capacity of 600 kilowatts. This is from a single, roughly 3km-deep borehole, not unlike KM8. That might provide many thousands, or potentially more than a million, kWh of heat energy over a whole year, depending on how the system was managed \u2013 which could be enough to heat 100 homes, just as Hoare suggested.\n\"It certainly sounds ambitious but it doesn't sound impossible,\" says Loveridge, who praises Third Energy's proposals for Kirby Misperton. \"And it's exactly the sort of thing we should be doing.\"\nRoughly a quarter of carbon emissions in the UK comes from the heating of buildings, Loveridge says, and it is particularly difficult to move away from heat sources such as natural gas. The vast majority of domestic heating systems in the UK currently use gas or oil and switching to alternatives can sometimes be costly or impractical for homeowners. Renewables such as geothermal ought to play a \"substantive\" role in the future, she says.\nThere are signs that geothermal energy is beginning to gain ground. The British Geological Survey began work on a project in 2024 that will see 28 relatively shallow boreholes, 225m (740ft) deep, drilled near their headquarters in Nottinghamshire \u2013 an effort to decarbonise the heating of the organisation's offices.\nElsewhere, the US Geothermal Technologies Office has run an initiative to explore converting old oil wells to geothermal energy sites in states including Utah, Texas and Nevada. The European Union has also funded research in a similar vein.\nWhile Third Energy is focused on deep boreholes, shallow boreholes, less than 500m (1,640ft) in depth, can be useful, too, says Falcone. This is because they can store thermal energy in the summer so that it will be available in the winter when heat is needed. This kind of system could supply a university campus or an urban district, she says.\nAs for Kirby Misperton, the heavy work required to make Third Energy's proposals a reality has not yet begun. Hoare says the firm received a grant for \u00a340,000 ($50,400) in February, which will help it move further towards launching a large-scale project beyond a mere demonstration.\nIn the meantime, Potter fizzes with enthusiasm at the potential. \"This is our home-produced heat energy,\" he says, mindful of the high price British homeowners have paid for imported gas and other heating fuels in recent years.\nIf a geothermal project at Kirby Misperton never gets off the ground, or never lives up to the promises made by Third Energy, Potter says he will be \"most disappointed\". But if it does work and if the technology could be replicated across the rest of the UK, he adds, \"It could be absolutely massive.\"\n*Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Kirby Misperton wells had yielded oil.

        "summary": "\"That well, if it was configured properly, could probably provide enough heat for 100 homes,\" says Hoare.Hoare also says that Third Energy has a total of 12 wells it could use for geothermal energy in Yorkshire, three of them at Kirby Misperton. That might provide many thousands, or potentially more than a million, kWh of heat energy over a whole year, depending on how the system was managed \u2013 which could be enough to heat 100 homes, just as Hoare suggested. As a result, he says, the three wells could supply much more energy than the paper's estimate \u2013 6,900,000 kWh over 12 months, or enough for a few hundred homes each requiring 10,000 kWh, allowing for some losses in the distribution of that heat.Fleur Loveridge at the University of Leeds in the UK, who specialises in underground energy systems, says there are examples of closed-loop borehole heat exchangers that have produced significant amounts of heat. \"This is our home-produced heat energy,\" he says, mindful of the high price British homeowners have paid for imported gas and other heating fuels in recent years.If a geothermal project at Kirby Misperton never gets off the ground, or never lives up to the promises made by Third Energy, Potter says he will be \"most disappointed\". In particular, she is highly sceptical of Third Energy's claim that KM8 alone could potentially provide enough heat for 100 British homes.",

        "article_text": "Their title hopes appear as good as over but can Arsenal return to winning ways when they play fellow high-fliers Nottingham Forest on Wednesday?\n\"Arsenal have stuffed up their title bid haven't they?\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"There are many reasons for that, but one of them is their indiscipline - it has really cost them this season.\n\"They need to win every game from here to match their points tally from last season but will that happen with Mikel Merino playing as a makeshift centre-forward? I don't see it, and they seem to be making it up as they go along.\"\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.\nFor the midweek fixtures in week 27, he takes on singer Paige Cavell, who is a Chelsea fan.\nCavell has had over 1.6m likes on TikTok and her new single, Owe It All To You featuring DJ icon Goddard, is out now.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nSince 2023, Cavell has sung on John Summit's Tears, Kaskade & Wilkinson's Shine On, and ACRAZE's The Otherside. \nCavell's family are Chelsea fans and she has followed in their footsteps by becoming a season ticket holder at Stamford Bridge.\n\"My mum's side of the family are Battersea born and bred and my dad's side were from Fulham, so Chelsea is all I've ever known!\" she told BBC Sport. \n\"I have quite literally been a fan since I was a baby. There is a picture of me, a few months old, at Stamford Bridge [see Paige's TikTok story here, or below], external on the pitch and touching the goal post.\n\"One of the best days of my life was a few years back, when my picture was put up at the stadium. Having been a fan ever since I can remember, it was crazy really.\n\"We had gone to the 2017 FA Cup final at Wembley and had good seats near the front - there were a load of photographers there taking pictures of the fans so, for a joke, I told my mum I was going to get in the programme. I started singing really loudly and held my scarf up for the cameras.\n\"A few months later, at the start of the following season, I got a phone call from one of my mates telling me there was a picture of me up at the stadium. \n\"I wasn't actually at that game, which was a bit annoying, so I was like 'are you joking me!?!'. \n\"Honestly, to this day, it was possibly one of the best days of my life when I got to see it for myself, although my brother was fuming because he is a huge Chelsea fan too and he was going 'why wasn't that me!?'\n\"I must say, as I've got older, being a Chelsea fan has become a little bit harder. When I was younger, we used to go to all the parades but obviously we've not won much recently.\n\"I think that my love for them has actually grown during all these rubbish times though. When, you're in the crowd with people going 'oh for god's sake' when things go wrong or after the game with everyone walking back to Fulham Broadway Station in silence, you realise how you stay together whatever happens.\n\"Every team goes through ups and downs and as much as we all want to be on top all the time, that just doesn't happen in football.\"\nChris Sutton and Paige Cavell were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nAllow TikTok content?\nThis article contains content provided by TikTok.

They need to find their feet again quickly, because I don't think anyone saw that result coming.\nI am pretty sure the readers will go for a 1-1 draw here and, although I'd like to pick a winner, I also think it will end up honours even.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nPaige's prediction: This is going to be close but I am backing Bournemouth - maybe I am still a bit sour about Brighton beating us twice in the space of a week. 2-3\nSelhurst Park, 19:30 GMT\nIt looks like fifth place will get you into the Champions League next season and that is the most interesting race at the top now the title is pretty much done and dusted.\nHalf of the Premier League will feel they have a chance of making it and Aston Villa are definitely one of those sides in the hunt.\nI am not sure Villa will pick up three points here, though.\nCrystal Palace don't score many goals at home - just 12 in 13 league games this season - and they don't win that many there either, just two so far in fact.\nBut at the same time, Villa are not great on the road - they have only won once away in the Premier League since the middle of October.\nI don't like to mention it but I was exactly right about Villa beating Chelsea 2-1 at the weekend, and I feel like they are a much easier team to predict than Palace are.\nPeople are getting excited about what Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio will do in Unai Emery's side but I think this is a tough game for Villa, especially with the form Jean-Philippe Mateta is in for Palace.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nPaige's prediction: My manager is a Palace fan and he says they are a bit inconsistent at the moment. He did mention that he thinks Mateta will score for them but, after Villa drew with Liverpool the other day, I think this is going to be another draw. 1-1\nMolineux, 19:30 GMT\nMatheus Cunha is on fire for Wolves, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions, and his side are now five points clear of the relegation zone with a better goal difference than the teams below them.\nThey wiped the floor with Fulham at Craven Cottage earlier in the season too, and Cunha scored twice in a 4-1 victory.\nIt all points towards a Wolves win here too, but I cannot seem to get a Fulham prediction right at the moment so I need to have a proper think about this one.\nBecause I have been wrong, so often, about Fulham, I am going for the opposite of what I think will happen and back them to win. \nMarco Silva's side do actually seem to be better on the road than at home right now, and they beat Newcastle in their last away league game. They didn't click at the weekend against Crystal Palace but they usually have a goal or two in them.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nPaige's prediction: Fulham are going to take this. I was going to back them anyway but I have spoken to a friend of mine who supports them and he said they had been playing well - he also said that Adama Traore will score against his former club. 1-2\nStamford Bridge, 20:15 GMT\nChelsea have looked very flat in recent weeks and ended up being beaten by Aston Villa on Saturday after taking the lead.\nEnzo Maresca's side are desperate to get back to winning ways so this is the perfect game for them - you could not ask for more of an open goal at the moment than playing Southampton at home.\nSaints will give Chelsea the chance to find their rhythm again and I don't see them keeping them out.\nI must say every week how dismal this season has been for Southampton fans, and probably the only thing they have to look forward to at the moment is the prospect of a day out in Norwich next season when they are back in the Championship. \nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nPaige's prediction: I have been bold here, I had to be! We have been struggling a bit recently but, because Southampton are bottom of the table, I am backing us to get a few goals and get a good result. Cole Palmer is going to get one or two goals in this one, I am backing him, and I will be at this game so I will be shouting loudly for him, especially if it is 2-0 and we need another goal for my prediction. 3-0\nPaige's favourite Chelsea player: On the back of my shirt it was always 'Lampard' and he was my hero. I was Chelsea's mascot once, at an away game against Manchester City and he was injured that day - my little heart was broken. Frank and Didier Drogba were my favourite players then and now it is Palmer. It has to be, really - he's been one of the few players we can rely on.\nPaige on Chelsea's season: We've been struggling recently but what's been really difficult as a fan is seeing little sparks of brilliance that make you think 'there it is! That's what we can do'. But they just don't last and what I've noticed, especially recently, is that unless we get a kick up the backside, nothing happens. We can be really lacklustre when I want to see us really trying from the moment we walk out on the pitch.\nEven so, we are still seventh, and only one point off fourth place.  We are kind of there, in the background but the top four is definitely doable if we could just find some consistency.\nGtech Community Stadium, 19:30 GMT\nThis is going to be close. Brentford have had back-to-back wins over West Ham and Leicester, while Everton's improvement under David Moyes has been dramatic.\nMoyes has done an incredible job but Everton have not suddenly become world-beaters. I do think they will lose some games, and this is one of them.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nPaige's prediction: I don't know anyone who supports either of these teams and they have both been doing well so I couldn't make my mind up. I got an Amazon delivery while I was deciding on my scores so I told the driver I was doing this for the BBC and asked him to give me a score. He went with Everton to win 2-0, so if it goes wrong, I am blaming him. 0-2\nOld Trafford, 19:30 GMT\nManchester United drew at Ipswich in November, in Ruben Amorim's first game in charge.\nThree months on, Ipswich will head to Old Trafford thinking they have a decent chance of beating them. No-one fears United at the moment.\nYou just don't know which United side is going to turn up and, in the first half against Everton on Saturday, they were absolutely woeful.\nUnited do deserve some credit for the way they fought back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Goodison Park but I am not convinced by them at all.\nIpswich ended up losing 4-1 to Tottenham at the weekend but they created a ridiculous amount of chances in that game, and they will get opportunities here too because Liam Delap is such a handful.\nA win for the Tractor Boys would be huge, especially now the gap to fourth-bottom Wolves has grown to five points, but despite United's many problems I just have a feeling Amorim will get a win, somehow.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nPaige's prediction: I have gone with United here. I know they are having a pretty bad season but being at home should give them the edge. 2-1\nCity Ground, 19:30 GMT\nSaturday's home defeat by West Ham was a real hammer blow for Arsenal's title hopes.\nThey need to bounce back and find a way of beating Nottingham Forest but this is a tough trip after such a devastating result, and I am not so sure they will take the points here either.\nForest are not in great form themselves, and got a bit of a walloping by Newcastle. Nuno Espirito Santo was clearly unhappy with some of his side's defending in that game.\nBut how are Arsenal going to score goals? I don't know at the moment.\nIf Gunners boss Mikel Arteta needs a left-back, he has got a few of them on the bench. Unfortunately he needs a centre-forward, and there is not one of those to be seen.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nPaige's prediction: This is going to be a very interesting game. I face-timed my best mate because her and her dad are Gunners , they are Arsenal mad. He reads this column every week and he loves it. He said this is going to be close - I said 2-2 and he said he agreed, but if one player can make a difference for Arsenal, it is Ethan Nwaneri. He has been brilliant recently but I am not sure he will win this for them. 2-2\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 19:30 GMT\nHow on earth am I supposed to predict what will happen here?\nIt's a fascinating game but it's impossible to call because it could end up 3-0 to either team.\nManchester City were subdued against Liverpool and while Jeremy Doku looked bright on their left flank, they didn't offer much of a threat elsewhere.\nTottenham put four goals past Ipswich but they could have conceded a few themselves, and you have to think City will have opportunities here.\nSpurs thumped Pep Guardiola's side 4-0 in November, but I am going for City to take the points this time. It will be close but they might just nick it.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nPaige's prediction: City are not having a great time of it but there is still quality in their team. You never know what Tottenham are going to do, so I gave them a goal, but City will still win. 1-2\nAnfield, 20:15 GMT\nThis fixture has plenty of history behind it - Liverpool's 4-3 win at Anfield in 1996 will always be remembered as a Premier League classic.\nNewcastle come into it in good shape after a good win over Nottingham Forest, but the way Liverpool beat Manchester City was extremely impressive.\nIt was such a mature performance by Arne Slot's side to soak up City's possession and be so clinical in front of goal.\nI think we know by now that Slot's side will be hard to beat, while Newcastle are still quite up and down - they were very poor when they went to Etihad Stadium last week.\nThey are capable of giving Liverpool a good game but I am going to say that the leaders will take the points, and carry on their title charge.\nAlong with Forest striker Chris 'The Wood Chopper' Wood, Newcastle's Alexander Isak has been one of the best players in the Premier League this season, but there is only one candidate to be crowned Player of the Year.\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah's numbers are extraordinary and he looks as hungry as ever.

They were much better against Forest on Sunday but no-one is stopping Liverpool now. 3-1\nLondon Stadium, 19:30 GMT\nWest Ham defended really well against Arsenal on Saturday and countered really well. \nTheir manager Graham Potter will be looking for his side to build on that victory and with Jarrod Bowen up front they will have too much firepower for the Foxes.\nThis is a gimme for West Ham, and it should be a routine victory for them.\nI just cannot make a case for Leicester to get anything here and it looks like their hopes of staying up have had it too.\nLike Southampton fans, the only thing Leicester supporters have to look forward to is the chance to visit Norwich next season. It's a nice city, and I fully recommend it for a day out.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nPaige's prediction: I know West Ham beat Arsenal on Saturday but I've not been convinced by either of these teams in the past few weeks. 1-1\nChris got six correct results from the 10 Premier League games in week 26, with one exact score, giving him a total of 90 points.\nThat was enough to beat his guest, singer Bradley Simpson, who got four correct results with no exact scores for a tally of 40 points, but Chris had to settle for a tie with the BBC readers. \nUsing the most popular scoreline from their predictions for each game, they also got six correct results with one exact score, meaning they also ended up with 90 points.",

Cole Palmer is going to get one or two goals in this one, I am backing him, and I will be at this game so I will be shouting loudly for him, especially if it is 2-0 and we need another goal for my prediction. 1-1What information do we collect from this quiz?Molineux, 19:30 GMTMatheus Cunha is on fire for Wolves, with four goals in his past four games in all competitions, and his side are now five points clear of the relegation zone with a better goal difference than the teams below them.They wiped the floor with Fulham at Craven Cottage earlier in the season too, and Cunha scored twice in a 4-1 victory.It all points towards a Wolves win here too, but I cannot seem to get a Fulham prediction right at the moment so I need to have a proper think about this one.Because I have been wrong, so often, about Fulham, I am going for the opposite of what I think will happen and back them to win.",

        "article_text": "The qualities that make us stand out the most, and the main reasons that people find us attractive, can be a blessing and a curse. Sometimes our most appealing traits can become a reason for a breakup.\n\"The ick\" was one of the more unusual words to be added to the Cambridge Dictionary in 2024. The phrase describes the feeling of suddenly seeing something about a partner in a new light, and finding it so unattractive it can't be unseen. Once you have the ick, it is unfortunately incurable.\nWhile the phrase might be intended in a lighthearted manner, it shows that there can be unattractive qualities about a partner that are not immediately obvious. In fact, we might have found those qualities really attractive earlier in the relationship. This is called \"fatal attraction\" \u2013 when a person comes to dislike aspects of a partner that they were initially attracted to. \"It doesn't mean fatal in the sense of deadly, but fatal as in the sense of prophetic,\" says Diane Felmlee, a social psychologist from Penn State University in the US.\u00a0\n\"I like to think of it as having 'too much' of an attractive quality,\" she says. \"Disenchantment with a partner can occur even when people get what they want, and perhaps because they get what they want.\"\nDuring her own research, Felmlee asks people for reasons they were first attracted to a partner, why they became dissatisfied and why past relationships ended. Most people listed various needs that were not being met by their ex-partner as a cause for a breakup. But Felmlee noticed some of those missed needs were related to reasons they were attracted to an ex-partner in the first place.\u00a0\n\"It is a different interpretation of the same quality,\" she says. \"It's a negative way of looking at a positive trait. I have an example here of someone who said they were attracted to their partner because she was considerate. And then they complained that she said 'sorry' too much. Well, that sounds pretty considerate.\"\nOther examples identified by Felmlee include being attracted to someone with a high-powered job, only to find that they spend too long at work, or finding a partner funny, but then complaining that they don't take life seriously. Easygoing, laid-back partners became flaky or never on time. \"Easygoing is great, as long as you're punctual,\" says Felmlee with a laugh.\nLikewise, partners who are at first judged to be powerful or strong become controlling or overbearing after a breakup. People who are nice become pushovers. Successful people become workaholics.\nWith fatal attraction, the stronger the initial attraction to a particular characteristic, the more likely it is to become a reason for a breakup. Why might it be that big positives end up being dealbreakers?\nFirst, it could be that the things we first notice about new partners, or potential partners, are the extreme qualities that make them stand out. \"We don't describe partners as 'kind of helpful', or 'a little hard working',\" says Felmlee. \"And the more extreme it is, the more likely people are to dislike those qualities later.\"\nThere might be an element of naivety too, adds Felmlee \u2013 our initial infatuation temporarily blinds us to the potential downsides of a very extreme characteristic. But after the initial excitement subsides, we become more aware of how those characteristics might have a negative effect.\nThis reevaluation can happen subtly over time. Fatal attraction might be a slow, dawning realisation rather than a drastic reversal in judgment as with the ick. Couples that have been together for between 10 and 21 years have the lowest levels of relationship adjustment, meaning that they find it harder between these ages to resolve conflicts, adjust to new challenges or change their expectations towards their partner.\nIt is important to reevaluate relationship satisfaction because it is a predictor for many aspects of life, according to Samantha Joel, a psychologist at Western University in Ontario, Canada. People in unhappy relationships have poorer physical health, higher blood pressure, are at higher risk of poor mental health and have worse work-life balance, among many other problems.\u00a0\nA simple measure of relationship satisfaction, called social exchange theory, can be made by comparing the rewards we receive from being with a partner, such as how much fun we have, if they make us feel prized, their beauty or money, against the costs, such as conflicts, the potential to be hurt or financial investments. There are two ways that people use social exchange theory \u2013 firstly by comparing a current relationship to past ones. We will find a relationship less satisfying if it falls below the standard that we expect based on past experiences. The other comparison we might make is with other options available to us currently. We might reject potential partners, even if we think the signs may be promising, if we feel we might have better odds with other people.\u00a0\nThose calculations will be different for everyone. Same-sex couples, for example, are likely to face higher relationship costs because of discrimination and homophobia. Depending on where you live, you might have fewer dating options available to you too.\nSo, are we better off being drawn to a middle-of-the-road partner with fewer extremes? \"I don't think so,\" says Felmlee. \"It is probably a better bet to look for someone with similar extremes to us rather than average qualities.\"\u00a0\nCouples that are similar in some key traits are more likely to be successful. Looking at a pool of 79,000 British couples, the strongest indicator for relationship satisfaction is being a similar age. But other demographic factors, including education, and some other things like religious or political beliefs and substance use are also strong predictors for relationship success. There are also smaller but still significant correlations between biological factors like being a similar height and BMI.\u00a0\n\"We found particularly high correlations for things like beliefs and values, educational attainment, and certainly substance use,\" says Tanya Horwitz, a doctoral student at the University of Colorado Boulder in the US. Similarity seems to be strengthening, but dissimilarity only seems to be a problem in certain circumstances. \"A smaller minority showed any sign of a negative correlation,\" she says. One example which did seem to matter was that morning people really don't seem to be compatible with evening people, and vice versa.\nHorwitz says that two very different people might still find themselves attracted to each other initially, but they are less likely to be successful long-term. The couples in her study were older, cohabiting, married or co-parenting. \"These were generally people who are in quite serious or long-term relationships, and I think it really says more about what makes for a long-term union, than what makes for an initial attraction,\" she says.\nFelmlee caveats that fatal attraction doesn't have to be terminal for a relationship. Partners who share similarly strong characteristics might do OK. \"Studying fatal attraction, it's less common for people to complain about the similar qualities that they say they have in themselves,\" she says.\nOne of her interviewees, an older man, said he was first attracted to his wife because of the strength of her character and her confidence. The downside, he said, is that she could sometimes be stubborn. \"But they're still married,\" says Felmlee. \"So what's going on? He also showed an awareness of himself and admitted he could be stubborn too. That was really sweet.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.\nMountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice \u2013 act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.\nBut since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes \u2013 or 5% \u2013 of their ice.\nAnd the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.\nThe study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.\nGlaciers are excellent indicators of climate change. \nIn a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.\nBut glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.\nBetween 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.\nThese numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.\nThe 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year \"corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day\", he told BBC News.\nThe rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.\nThe novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster \u2013 we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.\nThere are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nDirect measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.\nBy systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.\nThese community estimates \"are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings\", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.\n\"That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.\"\nGlaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate \u2013 depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.\nThat means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.\nBut, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\nThis could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.\n\"Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,\" Prof Zemp explained.\nThese consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems \u2013 or \"what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there\", as Prof Zemp puts it.\nHundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.\nAnd there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level \u2013 from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.\n\"Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,\" said Prof Shepherd.\nGlobal sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "A US judge has declined a request by the Associated Press to immediately restore its access to presidential events after the Trump administration blocked the agency in a dispute over the term \"Gulf of America\".\nUS District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, declined to grant the news outlet's emergency motion, but set another hearing for the case for 20 March. \nThe news agency has refused to change its style from the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\", after President Donald Trump renamed it with an executive order.\nThe AP argues the ban is retaliatory and infringes on First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and the press. \nThe ban has meant that the AP - which hundreds of news outlets rely on - has been unable to access press events at the White House as well as Air Force One. \nLast week, the US President said that he planned to \"keep them out\" until they begin using the term \"Gulf of America\". \nAfter the ruling on Monday, the White House said it stood by its decision to block access to the news agency.\n\"As we have said from the beginning, asking the President of the United States questions in the Oval Office and aboard Air Force One is a privilege granted to journalists, not a legal right,\" the Trump administration said in a statement. \n\"We stand by our decision to hold the Fake News accountable for their lies, and President Trump will continue to grant an unprecedented level of access to the press.\"\nShortly after the judge's decision became public, the White House put up two large electric signs in the briefing room which say \"Victory\" and \"Gulf of America\".\nThe AP, meanwhile, said in a statement that it was looking forward to the next hearing where \"we will continue to stand for the right of the press and the public to speak freely without government retaliation. This is a fundamental American freedom\".\nSoon after taking office in January, the Trump administration signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\", a move the White House said reflects the gulf's status as \"an indelible part of America\".\n\nThe AP said it would continue to use the term Gulf of Mexico, while acknowledging the Trump administration's efforts to rename it. \nIn response, the administration began clamping down on the AP's access to White House events covered by the \"pool\" of journalists that cover smaller events and report back to other media outlets. \nOn Monday, Judge McFadden said he declined the request from the AP for emergency relief because he did not believe the publication was suffering \"irreparable harm\" from the ban, according to CNN. The judge said the AP could access the same information from notes that other White House pool members had gathered.\nStill, during several points in the hearing, he called the ban \"discriminatory\" and problematic\", CNN reported.\nAP reporters still have access to the White House grounds. \nThe AP lawsuit specifically names three administration figures - Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich  -as it seeks to regain access. \n\"The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,\" the AP said in the lawsuit. \nOn a trip with the White House pool to Florida last week, the BBC witnessed an AP reporter and one of its photographers be told by an official that they were a \"no go\" for the trip after clearing security at Joint Base Andrews a short while before Air Force One was due to depart. \nOver the course of the next several days, the AP team - which had travelled to Florida unilaterally - was repeatedly prevented from joining the pool of reporters covering Trump at his estate in Mar-a-Lago, as well as a trip to the Daytona 500 Nascar race. \nSpeaking to reporters at Mar-a-Lago on 18 February, Trump said that \"we're going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it's the Gulf of America\". \n\"We're very proud of this country,\" he said. \"We want it to be the Gulf of America\". \nLast week, dozens of news organisations - including conservative outlets such as Fox and NewsMax - signed a letter organised by the White House Correspondents' Association in which they urged the White House to reconsider its stance on the AP.

        "article_text": "Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed.\nIsrael said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including \"humiliating\" handover ceremonies.\nA senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to \"grave danger\" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel.\nThe deal's first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun.\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that the ceasefire was \"precarious\" and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs. \nHe also called for the \"dignified release of all remaining hostages\".\nOn Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deal's first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages.\nAs with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel.\nLater, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages' families condemned the video as a \"sickening display of cruelty\".\nThere was already fury in Israel after Hamas  returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.\nIt emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibas's body later that day.\nIsraeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfir's captors killed the boys \"with their bare hands\", contradicting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike.\nIsrael was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails.\nThey had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers.\nIn the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister's office said the release would be postponed \"in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes\".\n\"It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies.\"\nHamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel's decision as a \"blatant violation\" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released.\n\"We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released,\" Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday.\nAsked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that \"all options are on the table\".\n\"Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen],\" he added.\n\"Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians?\"\nNaim said Hamas had discussed Israel's complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released.\nThe White House backed Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an \"appropriate response\" to what it called the \"barbaric treatment\" of hostages by Hamas.\nBut President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting \"an extension of phase one\".\n\"We're hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released,\" he told CNN on Sunday.\nA total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase.\nSo far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released, while the bodies of the last four hostages are scheduled to be handed over this week. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal.\nThe agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day.\nThe ceasefire's second phase should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\nAt least 48,346 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nMost of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",

That is why this claim is completely artificial against my clients.\"\nHe asked the court to strike out the claim against the band members as individuals and for it to proceed against the company only.\nIn written submissions for FSA, Andrew Burns KC, said The 1975 - who were due to be paid 350,000 dollars (\u00a3274,000) for a one-hour performance - \"deliberately behaved in a way to challenge and provoke the Malaysian authorities\".\nThe band first played the festival in 2016, agreeing at the time not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, he noted.\nBut they \"planned provocative conduct\" in 2023, which included a bottle of wine being \"smuggled\" on stage, a \"second-rate set of songs\" to \"punish and upset the Malaysian audience and authorities\" and an \"obscene speech\"; as well as the kiss which courted much publicity online, the submissions claimed.\n\"This is also a case where they could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" he said in the document.\n\"It is therefore fair, just and reasonable for the duty of care to be imposed and for them to answer for their acts of procuring breaches of contract.\"\nThe court heard that Malaysian authorities had initially refused to let the band perform amid reports about Healy's recent recovery from drug addiction.\nBut they agreed to allow the performance to take place after the band promised Healy would adhere to all guidelines and regulations, Mr Burns added.\n\"The band should be held liable as the loss was caused by their intentional misbehaviour breaching the express assurances that were given which gave rise to their personal duties of care and their responsibility for their own personal behaviour.\"\nThe court hearing is expected to conclude on Wednesday.\nIn footage shared online, Healy could be seen telling the crowd that the band's decision to appear in Malaysia had been a \"mistake\".\n\"When we were booking shows, I wasn't looking into it,\" Healy said. \"I do not see the point of inviting the 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with.\n\"Unfortunately you don't get a set of loads of uplifting songs because I'm [expletive] furious,\" the frontman continued. \"And that's not fair on you, because you're not representative of your government. Because you're young people, and I'm sure a lot of you are gay and progressive and cool.\"\nHealy and MacDonald then kissed as the band played the song I Like America & America Likes Me.\nSoon after - just 30 minutes into the set - Healy and the band walked off stage, with the singer telling the audience: \"Alright, we just got banned from Kuala Lumpur, see you later.\"\nAfter their Malaysian festival appearance was cut short, the band cancelled further concerts in Indonesia and Taiwan.\nHealy's protest stunt sparked backlash from some LGBT activists and allies in the country, with many calling it an act of \"performative activism\" that would make their lives even harder. Some said it displayed a \"white saviour complex\".\nIn a statement after the show, a source close to the band said Healy had wanted to stand up for the LGBT community.\nSeveral months later, Healy defended the move in a 10-minute speech delivered at a 1975 concert in Dallas, Texas.\nHealy said the kiss was \"not a stunt simply meant to provoke the government\" but an \"ongoing part of the 1975 stage show which had been performed many times prior\".\nHe described online anger over the performance as \"liberal outrage\", and said criticism of the band for \"remaining consistent\" by performing its \"pro-LGBT stage show\" was puzzling.",

        "article_text": "The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan's civil war, the BBC has learned.\nAid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut.\nIt is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected.\nThe conflict between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023.\nThe kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods.\n\"People are knocking on the volunteers' doors,\" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. \"People are screaming from hunger in the streets.\"\nThe Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was \"serving US interests\", and moved to begin dismantling USAID.\nThe State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice.\nThe normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance \u2013 on which the communal kitchens depend \u2013 will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes.\nThe closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations.\nThe network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country's civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID.\nIt's a \"huge setback\" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who's set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms.\nThe former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN.\nMoney had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works.\n\"It was ground-breaking,\" says Ms Tracy. \"The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets (humanitarian group) in Syria.\"\nFor Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out.\nThere was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege.\nMost of the kitchens have closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon \"we expect to see a lot of people starving\".\nHere and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy's Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID.\n\"I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],\" she said, \"but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it's never going to be what it was.\"\n\"These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,\" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation.\nThey are \"exhausted, traumatised and underfunded\" and \"we were scaling up to help them\".\nThe State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful.\n\"The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,\" it said in response to a BBC query.\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances.\nIn 2024 the United States was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan.\nTop UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington's policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries.\n\"I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,\" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP's assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month.\nThe influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further.\n\"We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,\" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' regional bureau director.\nHe had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. \"We are strained. It's extremely difficult.\"\nThey both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, \"it is a million extra people who've come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger\", says Ms Dagesh.\nMost families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority.\n\"But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,\" she said.\nMost of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people.\nThey say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing.\nFaced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape.\nMany of the refugees she met had come from Sudan's agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods.\nThey would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight.\nWith the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders.\nYet aid agencies that normally would help are strained. \nThe UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise \"to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum\".\nIt does not help that the agency was already underfunded. \nThe UNHCR's call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut \"everything\", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive.\nThe US has been the UNHCR's main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo. \n\"We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,\" Mr Balde told the BBC.\nFaced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on \"very dangerous journeys\", says Mr Balde.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Neil McCann, Barry Ferguson and Billy Dodds are back together on the Rangers training ground\nIn beaming up four Rangers men to plug the gaps left behind by Philippe Clement's fallen enterprise, chief executive Patrick Stewart has decided, somewhat predictably, to go where many have gone before at Ibrox.\nThe club's fixation in employing ex-players as coaches hit a new level on Monday. How many Rangers men does it take to change a club? Turns out it's four, albeit as part of an interim collective.\nBarry Ferguson, who has managed Clyde, Kelty Hearts and Alloa Athletic, is head coach until the end of the season. He hasn't held a managerial position since leaving Alloa three years ago. It's fair to say that Ferguson's stellar era at Rangers as a player did a whole lot of heavy lifting in his employment as caretaker boss.\nHe's supported by Neil McCann, a terrific BBC pundit and a big personality. His managerial jobs were at Dundee in 2017-18 and as Inverness Caledonian Thistle caretaker in 2021. McCann is bright and energetic and has been brutally honest in his punditry about Rangers' weaknesses.\nBilly Dodds, another respected Sportsound voice, is a part of the temporary regime too. Like McCann, he's been outspoken on where Rangers have been going wrong under Clement. Of the four coaches, he has had the most success by far.\nAs assistant coach at Ross County, Dodds won the League Cup in 2016 and, as manager, he took Caley Thistle to the Scottish Cup final in 2023.\nThe fourth man is Allan McGregor, a legend of the club in goals but whose coaching credentials are thin, to put it kindly. \nMcGregor has kept a pretty low profile since he retired as a player. He hasn't given off the impression of a man desperately keen to get involved on a training ground, but here he is. Another Bear in the big house.\nGlasgow pressure 'doesn't stop', says Rodgers\nListen: Clement sacking podcast special\n'Rangers locked in vicious cycle as Clement departs'\nFrom elsewhere in Scottish football there will be derision at the old guard being sent for in something of a blind panic. Was John \"Bomber\" Brown unavailable? This is where Rangers are right now, though. \nWith a review of the club's operations in train, a sporting director to find and a new manager to recruit, they have gone to the short-terms option of a Bear Scramble - men who have an intimate knowledge of the club and the league.\nClement's credibility ran out when his team lost to St Mirren on Saturday, a 10th time this season, even outside of Celtic games, when Rangers failed to beat domestic opposition. It was such a limp performance on the back of the loss to Queen's Park that he couldn't hope to survive it.\nThe Belgian is a strong character, but he looked hopelessly diminished on Saturday evening. Booed to the rafters by the supporters, the news of his exit came as no surprise.\nThe Ibrox Four have to pick up the pieces now. Their in-tray must be in danger of  collapsing under the weight of things they must do in order to make their months a success, which, in their position, is a relative concept. What can they achieve ahead of a possible takeover and a new managerial regime moving in?\nBilly Dodds, Allan McGregor, Barry Ferguson and Neil McCann were in the 2002 Scottish League Cup winning squad\nIt's supposed to be fun, but too many of these Rangers players look hesitant and scared, taking easy options instead of doing the brave thing in possession.\nThat's a by-product of pressure and the consequences of failure, so the new coaching ticket had better lighten the mood. The weight of the world appears to be on the shoulders of these players and Clement's day-to-day intensity will probably not have helped.\nThe players look broken. There's a job of coaching and a job of psychology to be done here. They need direction and motivation. \nAs much as tactical issues, they need their heads cleared first. The new coaches need to lift the mood with positivity and energy and hope like hell they can galvanise a beaten dressing room.\nIt's been said that Rangers are a team of moments, which is kind of true. They rely heavily on Vaclav Cerny to do something. If it's not Cerny, it's Hamza Igamane and, if it's not him, then, er, who else is there?\nIgamane is a talent, no doubt about it, but he's gone quiet. No goals in seven games is a terrible drop-off for a guy who scored 10 in his previous 12. He's young and maybe the grim mood at Rangers has got to him, which makes the next point crucial.\nThey can't give them domestic trophies, but they can provide some reason to believe that next season might be better. McCann and Dodds have spent all season pointing out weaknesses in Rangers' defensive structure and in their attacking shape. Now the heat is on them to actually do something about it.\nIt would have been easy for them to stay in the studio and comment from a safe space - talk is cheap - but they've abandoned the safety net and deserve a lot of credit for that.\nThey have to improve players. Clement did that in a blistering start to his time at Ibrox, but he fell away badly after that. \nOnce the interim team moves on, they have to be able to point to numerous players and say that they're in a better place to cope with the strains.\nWhen the managerial team arrive in the summer, they need to have more substantial characters in their dressing room. More leaders. More guys with the confidence to speak and problem-solve mid-game. They're all too timid now. Toughening up the mentality is an achievable goal for the interim crew.\nStephen Robinson's St Mirren signalled the end for Philippe Clement at Ibrox\nIt wasn't games against Celtic - or any on the testing fields of Europe - that did for Clement. It was the relentless toil of trying to break down organised teams who defended deep and with discipline and organisation.\nCeltic nearly always find a way because they have a manager and senior players who have nous. Clement struggled more and more as the season went on.

If they do, the skies will brighten somewhat.\nClement did a terrific job in getting Rangers into the top-eight of the Europa League. An automatic last 16 spot was hard-earned and well-deserved. Those types of games where Rangers were the counter-attacking underdog were the ones that Clement got right.\nThey have Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce next week and the week after. These are Rangers' cup finals now. Fenerbahce have Fred (although suspended for the first leg), Filip Kostic (from the Eintracht Frankfurt Europa League final team), Sofyan Amrabat (of Morocco World Cup 2023 fame), Edin Dzeko and Dusin Tadic.\nKnocking them out would be a massive achievement.

        "summary": "How might four Rangers men fare in their hour of need?Image source, SNSImage caption, Neil McCann, Barry Ferguson and Billy Dodds are back together on the Rangers training groundTom EnglishBBC Scotland's chief sports writer@tenglishsportPublished24 February 2025In beaming up four Rangers men to plug the gaps left behind by Philippe Clement's fallen enterprise, chief executive Patrick Stewart has decided, somewhat predictably, to go where many have gone before at Ibrox.The club's fixation in employing ex-players as coaches hit a new level on Monday. What can they achieve ahead of a possible takeover and a new managerial regime moving in?Let the sunshine inImage source, SNSImage caption, Billy Dodds, Allan McGregor, Barry Ferguson and Neil McCann were in the 2002 Scottish League Cup winning squadIt's supposed to be fun, but too many of these Rangers players look hesitant and scared, taking easy options instead of doing the brave thing in possession.That's a by-product of pressure and the consequences of failure, so the new coaching ticket had better lighten the mood. Of the four coaches, he has had the most success by far.As assistant coach at Ross County, Dodds won the League Cup in 2016 and, as manager, he took Caley Thistle to the Scottish Cup final in 2023.The fourth man is Allan McGregor, a legend of the club in goals but whose coaching credentials are thin, to put it kindly. With a review of the club's operations in train, a sporting director to find and a new manager to recruit, they have gone to the short-terms option of a Bear Scramble - men who have an intimate knowledge of the club and the league.Clement's credibility ran out when his team lost to St Mirren on Saturday, a 10th time this season, even outside of Celtic games, when Rangers failed to beat domestic opposition. Like McCann, he's been outspoken on where Rangers have been going wrong under Clement.",

Both have been working in the media, primarily for the BBC.\n\"Neil and Billy have got experience of managing at a good level,\" Ferguson said. \"Alongside Allan, they played with the club, know the demands and expectations, so that was important to me as well.\n\"They are bubbly about the place, big characters, like to get in amongst the boys and that's important because the last couple of weeks has been difficult.\n\"It was important I got the right people in. They are not yes men.\"\nIt is almost exactly three years since Ferguson resigned from his last managerial position with League 1 Alloa Athletic. \nHe had been in charge for nine months and left the club eighth in the third-tier table. Prior to that he had spells in the fourth tier with Clyde and Kelty Hearts.\nSince then, Ferguson said he had been enjoying the \"quiet life\", working with Rangers as a club ambassador, and harboured no immediate plans to return to the dugout until this opportunity arose. \nWhen asked if he felt ready to embrace the challenge of such a huge job, Ferguson's response was robust and emphatic.\n\"I wouldn't be siting here if I didn't,\" he said.\nHe added: \"I went down a different route as an ambassador.\n\"Did I want to get back into coaching and management? If I'm being brutally honest, I wasn't thinking about it. But when that phone call comes, there was no way I was going to turn it down.\n\"I am desperate to get started.

A lot of games coming up.\n\"I'm here until the end of the season and I'm going to give it everything I've got to try and get results for this football club.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'As a manager you have to be big enough to make that better'\nLong-time captain James Tavernier has not escaped fan criticism during Rangers' underwhelming league campaign to date.\nThe most prolific defender in British football history, the 33-year-old has had the armband since 2018.\nDuring a five-hour visit to Rangers' training ground on Monday evening with his coaches, Ferguson talked to Tavernier and remains convinced he is the right man. \n\"I don't think there was any need to change,\" he said. \"I had a good chat with James last night; he came in while we were in getting to know some of the staff.\n\"I spoke to him, looked him in the eyes and have no doubt he will give me 100% to lead this club until the end of the season.\"\nEighteen-year-olds Bailey Rice and Findlay Curtis were namechecked by the new boss as he discussed developing talent from the Rangers academy.\nFerguson - who forced his way into Dick Advocaat's Rangers team at the age of 18 - stressed the importance of bringing through home-grown players and suggested he would be willing to give youth its chance.\n\"If they're good enough, I will have no issue with playing them,\" he said.\n\"The door is open for young players and it is important as a club you always produce your own.

It will need incredible courage and we must play to win.\n\"We could still lose, but we have to show that courage and be ourselves. We have to play so well, especially after the result we took away in the first leg.\"\nOpta statistics rate City's chances of advancing at a more optimistic 19.8%, but those percentages must be viewed through the prism of Real's history in this tournament and the muscle memory that kicks in for the 15-time winners when it matters.\nGuardiola's record with City against Real is chequered, though it started with victory in the last 16 in 2020, the two legs being played six months apart because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe most bitter moment came two years later when City led by two goals on aggregate in the 90th minute of the semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu, only for Rodrygo to score twice within seconds, Karim Benzema's injury-time penalty sending Real on to eventual victory over Liverpool in the final in Paris.\nWhen Guardiola, as Manchester City manager, claimed his third Champions League crown in 2023, after winning with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Real were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the Spanish champions then prevailing on penalties last season.\nHe said: \"I have some incredible memories here - sometimes good ones, sometimes not so good. \n\"We know at this stage, and in this stadium, the pressure is there - but you get that in Milan, in Barcelona, at Anfield. You have to suffer at these places, but you have to reduce those moments.\"\nReal's remarkable win against City in 2022 is the sort of sporting lightning strike Guardiola will seek to turn back on them, but he must do it with a fading team that has lost its domestic supremacy after winning a historic four successive Premier Leagues, and now faces the prospect of going out of the Champions League before the last 16 for the first time in 12 years.\nCarlo Ancelotti (left) and Pep Guardiola will be meeting in the Champions League for the 10th time\nThe wily Ancelotti was not taking Guardiola's bait about percentages when he spoke in Madrid on Tuesday, saying: \"He doesn't really think that. We don't think we have a 99% chance. We have a small advantage - and we have to take advantage of that.\"\nGuardiola responded: \"For the first time he didn't believe me. I always say what I think, and this time you don't believe me.\"\nStatistics pile up like giant obstacles in front of City's route to the last 16, explaining why Real are overwhelming favourites after two goals in a late surge gave them victory at Etihad Stadium.\nIt was the 40th time Real have won the first leg of a European knockout-stage tie away from home, progressing on 37 of the previous 39 occasions.\nCity's defeat, meanwhile, was the fifth time they have lost the first leg of a Champions League knockout-stage tie, going on to be eliminated on the previous four occasions.\nFor Ancelotti, this tournament's greatest coach with five wins, he will be meeting Guardiola in the Champions League for the 10th time, on eight occasions with Real against City. The Italian has won four of their nine meetings, never losing at home, winning two games and drawing two.\nOf more recent significance is that to unseat the holders, City will have to alter poor form in the competition after losing their past three away games to Sporting, Juventus and Paris St-Germain.\nGuardiola's spirits will be lifted by Saturday's 4-0 win over Newcastle United which included a hat-trick inside 14 first-half minutes for new Egyptian signing Omar Marmoush, while Erling Haaland demonstrated his quality with both goals in the first-leg defeat, his first against Real Madrid.\nHaaland has been prolific in the Champions League, scoring 49 goals in 48 games. If he scores at the Bernabeu, he will become the fastest player to 50 goals in appearances and age, at 24 years and 213 days.\nIt could even be a Champions League farewell to Manchester City for modern greats of the club such as Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and goalkeeper Ederson, while others such as Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic are also in their 30s.\nGuardiola would not be drawn as he said: \"I would like to answer this but it will be at the end of the season. We still have a lot to play for, to qualify for the Champions League next season, we are still there in the Champions League this season. We have the FA Cup and the Club World Cup.\"\nSilva added: \"If you had told me at the start of the season that we would be in this position in the Champions League and the Premier League I wouldn't have believed you. We deserve to be in this complicated situation because of where we finished.\n\"We have to believe. We still believe things can go our way, but this season is certainly a lesson for the future.\"\nFor Manchester City, that future is now - in the forbidding, unforgiving surroundings of the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nAnd if Guardiola can overcome those \"1%\" odds in this footballing cathedral, it will rank alongside the best results of his career.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

It made a difference.\"\nAccording to Ofcom's first review of public service television broadcasting, audiences said early evening programmes, like soaps, had an important social role in airing complex and controversial issues.\nOne example came in the early 2000s, when the soap featured a domestic violence and coercive control storyline featuring Little Mo Slater (Kacey Ainsworth) and her brutal partner Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns).\nActor Ainsworth says members of the public would often confuse her for her character and offer sympathy to her in the street. \"People would try and sit me down in places, they'd put their arms around me,\" she says. \"They'd want to look after me.\"\nThe actor adds she received \"hundreds\" of letters a week from victims of similar violence.\nThough one watchdog at the time said the show went \"too far\" for pre-watershed TV, research for a national domestic violence helpline highlighted the storyline as the most significant TV portrayal of violence in the home in 30 years.\nMolly Rainford, who plays Anna Knight, was introduced to the Square in 2023. She is the daughter of George Knight and Cindy Beale and is part of the first black and dual heritage family to run a pub on any UK soap.\nIn February 2024, the soap aired scenes of Molly and her on-screen sister, Gina Knight (Francesca Henry), discussing colourism and how differently they are treated because of their different skin tones.\nColourism is prejudice against people who have a darker skin tone or the preferential treatment of those who are the same race but have lighter skin.\nSpeaking about the storyline, Rainford says: \"These are conversations that happen in every mixed-raced family's life. All of these conversations are so important and so valid, especially right now.\"\nRainford says parents told her their children had \"conversations on the playground that day after seeing that\".\nIn 2015, Riley Carter Millington became the first transgender man to play a recurring trans character in a British soap, with his portrayal of Kyle Slater in EastEnders.\nCarter Millington says \"there wasn't a lot of on-screen representation\" for trans people and he was \"overwhelmed\" and grateful to have been cast in the role.\n\"I understood the weight of it and I didn't take it lightly,\" the actor says, adding that despite leaving the soap in 2016, he still gets messages from fans about his character.\nKemp adds that EastEnders is \"ever-evolving\" with society - and that while there will \"always be a certain crowd that will poo poo it and look down upon it\", it has made some \"landmark television\" over the last 40 years.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, you can visit BBC Action Line, including for issues related to sexual abuse and violence and domestic abuse.\nAs part of EastEnders' 40th anniversary week, BBC News will be hosting live coverage of the live episode on Thursday 20 February, which you can watch on BBC One and iPlayer, and follow on our live page.\nFrom Wednesday, you'll be able to cast your vote here on who Denise decides her future is with, Jack or Ravi.",

        "article_text": "For Brian Kreher, a fourth-generation farmer in the small town of Clarence, New York, the latest outbreak of bird flu has meant many sleepless nights.\nHe considers his 18-acre farm one of the lucky ones. With extensive safety precautions, he hasn't lost any birds to the virus, which has ravaged poultry farms across the US.\nBut the outbreak forced him to make tough calls, like deciding whether to accept a new batch of baby chicks from a hatchery near a virus hotspot in Pennsylvania. If he didn't, he would have no chickens to replace those that die or get sick.\n\"I had no choice,\" Kreher told the BBC. \"It was either accept those baby chicks, or over the next year, we slowly exit farming.\"\n\"Egg farmers are in the fight of our lives and we are losing,\" he said.\nThough the avian flu, or H5N1, has circulated among American poultry flocks for years, an outbreak starting in 2022 has wreaked havoc on farms, killing over 156 million birds and sending egg prices skyrocketing. The virus then got a foothold among dairy cows last year, and this month, a different strain - tied to severe infections in humans - was found in the cattle.\nThe worsening outbreak comes as President Donald Trump's new administration makes sweeping cuts to government staffing and research funding that public health experts say threatens the country's ability to respond to bird flu and other potential pandemics.\nThis week, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) told the BBC it fired several officials who were working on the response to bird flu before trying to hire them back days later. The administration also promised billions in funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health, which scientists say could hamper research that helps them understand the evolution of viruses.\n\"Right now, the risk to most Americans remains low, but the virus is continuing to surprise us, and so that could change, and could change quickly,\" said Michaela Simoneau, a global health security fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\"I worry, as all of these funding cuts are in the political conversation, that we don't cut those programs that have been shown to be most essential.\"\nTrump officials said they are working on a new plan to respond to bird flu, one that includes more safety precautions and vaccines while moving away from culling - a process where farmers kill all their birds after one flock becomes infected to prevent the spread of the highly contagious and fatal disease.\nWhen asked for details about the new strategy, the White House did not provide specifics to the BBC, but said Joe Biden's administration had \"crushed American agriculture with regulatory uncertainty\", inflation and \"radical environmental policies\".\nScientists have seen a number of warning signs in recent months that the avian flu is adapting to infect humans, said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular biology professor at Johns Hopkins University.\nInfluenza viruses don't typically grow well in mammals, so the length of time the virus has circulated in dairy cows is concerning because it allows more opportunities to evolve, Mr Pekosz said.\nBird flu infected cattle for the first time ever in the US at the beginning of last year. Since then, there have been nearly 1,000 confirmed cases across 17 states. There also have been 68 confirmed cases among humans, most of whom worked closely with animals.\nThen, in February, a new variant of the virus - called D1.1 - was detected in dairy cows and an infected worker in Nevada for the first time. The strain also caused two severe infections in humans in North America, a teenager in hospital in British Columbia and a patient in Louisiana who died from the virus.\nThe new variant also means there are now at least two instances in which cows have caught the virus from wild birds, and not other dairy herds.\n\"We're seeing these little red flags, real signs that the virus is making some inroads,\" Mr Pekosz said.\nThe virus has upended poultry and dairy farms where workers have had to kill millions of birds to prevent more infections. It's a battle US consumers have felt at the grocery store and a recurring theme during the presidential campaign - in January, the average cost of eggs in the US rose more than 15% from a year ago, to $4.95 a dozen.\nMr Kreher said that despite a host of security measures, including washing vehicles on farms, wearing steel-toed boots and using lasers to deter wild birds, the outbreak continues to worsen across the country.\nBird flu \"is on our minds from the moment we get up to the moment we sleep, if sleep comes\", he said. \"We need new strategies to fight this virus.\"\nCalifornia poultry farmer Christian Alexandre has seen firsthand the financial and emotional devastation of a bird flu outbreak. In 2022, he had to kill all 45,000 of his chickens when the virus spread at his family farm near the Oregon border.\n\"It was extremely painful,\" said Mr Alexandre, president of the American Pastured Poultry Producers Association.\nIn response to soaring egg prices, Trump officials now say they want to move away from the slaughtering, focusing instead on preventative measures.\nKevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told the BBC's US partner CBS News last week that he is working on a plan with newly confirmed USDA leader Brooke Rollins to combat the virus \"with biosecurity and medication\".\n\"Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week,\" Hassett said.\nMr Alexandre said he was not sure that vaccinations and other precautions could replace the need to cull flocks - but he said new ideas were desperately needed.\n\"What farmers and the USDA have been doing has just obviously not worked,\" he said. \"We're in a crisis.\"\nVaccines for birds against the avian flu already exist in countries around the world, and last week, the USDA granted conditional approval to a new shot developed by Zoetis.\nStill, many poultry industry groups oppose vaccinating birds against the virus. This is because most countries don't accept exports of poultry that are vaccinated because of fears that it masks the presence of the virus, said Tom Super of the National Chicken Council.\nPublic health experts have been critical of the US government's response to bird flu since the virus first spread to dairy cows, arguing Biden officials fell short in their disease surveillance efforts.\nBut Trump's team has slowed communications about the disease, which also concerns public health experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reportedly withheld weekly reports on bird flu and canceled weeks of briefings with lawmakers and state health officials.\n\"I haven't seen anything from this administration that would say that they're taking this outbreak any more seriously,\" Mr Pekosz said.\nMs Simoneau sees one encouraging sign from the Trump administration: Gerald Parker, a bird flu expert, veterinarian and former top-ranking health official, was chosen to lead the White House's Pandemic Office.\nAt the same time, she said, the wide cuts and the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization under Trump's leadership could hamper efforts to respond to H5N1.\n\"We're cutting ourselves off from that global information system at a time when we really need all of those signals that we can get,\" she said.\nMs Simoneau said fatigue and a decrease in trust in public health officials following the Covid pandemic makes for a difficult environment for any administration to respond to a potential health crisis.

This is because most countries don't accept exports of poultry that are vaccinated because of fears that it masks the presence of the virus, said Tom Super of the National Chicken Council.Public health experts have been critical of the US government's response to bird flu since the virus first spread to dairy cows, arguing Biden officials fell short in their disease surveillance efforts.But Trump's team has slowed communications about the disease, which also concerns public health experts. \"We're cutting ourselves off from that global information system at a time when we really need all of those signals that we can get,\" she said.Ms Simoneau said fatigue and a decrease in trust in public health officials following the Covid pandemic makes for a difficult environment for any administration to respond to a potential health crisis.",

You have to ride the rhythm.\"\nTeams like Bournemouth have had huge success playing in this more aggressive style - but does it also help sides playing away from home, with less onus on them to dominate the ball and push forward, but instead break quickly and hit teams on the counter-attack?\nThe percentage of goals scored after \"fast breaks\", according to Opta, has never been higher than this season.\nOne in 10 goals are scored like this - 10.2% - with the next highest proportion down at 7.7% in 2022-23.\nThe average number of fast breaks per game is up in general, as is the number of direct attacks per game.\nIt feeds into the notion of the classic, archetypal 'away goal' - soak up pressure, win the ball back and hit the home side on the break.\nOn the subject of away goals - there have been a lot of them. The 1.52 goals per game on average scored by away teams this season is the highest-ever in the Premier League.\nWhy Guardiola's tactics stopped working amid rise of rapid football\nEmbracing the chaos - breaking down Bournemouth's rise\nGoing back to Ferguson's quote, his Manchester United side were famed for making their Old Trafford home a fortress when they dominated English football for long periods during the 1990s and 2000s.\nAfter their 3-0 win there in December, Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola even modestly said: \"It doesn't happen a lot that you come to this kind of stadium and win 3-0.\"\nBut this isn't quite the case anymore, with the Red Devils losing seven of their 13 home games so far in 2024-25.\nOld Trafford isn't the only big ground which seems to have lost its fear-factor.\nChelsea, who went 86 games unbeaten at Stamford Bridge between 2004-2008, have only won six of their 12 matches at home this season - despite an improved showing on last campaign.\nMeanwhile, champions Manchester City have already lost three times at Etihad Stadium after a 52-game unbeaten run at home in all competitions was ended by Tottenham's 4-0 win there in November.\nAcross the entire league, no side remains unbeaten on their own ground, with runaway leaders Liverpool holding the best home record with nine wins, two draws and one defeat.\nAnd the old adage that you have to win your home games to stay up? Well, the bottom three have just four home wins in 41 matches between them.\nThe Covid-19 era showed fans likely had a positive impact on how home teams performed - but can home supporters have a negative effect too?\nSome might say the Goodison Park grumbles which accompanied Sean Dyche's final days as Everton boss are in stark contrast to the partisan passion on show under David Moyes' resurgent side. Have fans had an influence there?\nSome of this season's struggling teams have seen their own supporters turn hostile on occasion.\n\"You're not fit to wear the shirt,\" was one chant aimed at Leicester City players by Foxes fans in Friday's 4-0 home defeat by Brentford at King Power stadium.\nIt's a ground where protests against the club's hierarchy have been commonplace in recent weeks - a period in which, perhaps coincidentally, Leicester's home form has seen six consecutive league defeats without scoring - setting a new unwanted Premier League record in the process.\nLeicester boss Ruud van Nistelrooy agrees supporters have a right to voice their opinion - but speaking before the Brentford game, he emphasised just how much fan backing can mean to teams.\n\"Looking back as a player, when you played in front of your home crowd and there is a connection from a tackle, pass, cross or difficult moments in a game where support is lifting you, I know as a coach and someone who loves sports and football what it does to the team,\" he explained.\nSimilar, though perhaps less vocal protests, have been witnessed at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in recent months.\nIronically, the most visible signs of discontent came as Spurs beat Manchester United earlier this month - but home fans had not seen their injury-hit team win at home in the league since early November, and that three-month wait for a home league win included defeats by relegation-battlers Ipswich Town and Leicester.\nWhile there has been some chat this season about employing the \"dark arts\" - just cast your mind back to the chaos surrounding Man City v Arsenal last September - there's an argument this continues to be on the decline in football.\nTime-wasting directives from the Premier League since the start of last season have perhaps discouraged away teams from negatively slowing the game down in an attempt to pinch a draw.\nAverage ball-in-play time this campaign - 57.05 minutes - is the second-highest for any season since Opta started recording the number in 2006-07.\nWhen you add in the watchful eye of the video assistant referee, players having to temporarily leave the field if they receive treatment, and players who are substituted being able to exit the pitch anywhere, it's only becoming harder for away teams to adopt stifling tactics.\nMaybe sides not winning as many home games is simply down to teams being better set up to win away from home - and having more reasons to try to do so.\nThat and the fact there isn't a single grey away kit, external in the Premier League this season...\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "\"In the next 50 years, you will not find one Israeli leader that will propose to you what I propose to you now.\n\"Sign it! Sign it and let's change history!\"\nIt was 2008. Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was imploring the Palestinian leader to accept a deal he believed could have brought peace to the Middle East.\nIt was a two-state solution - a prospect which seems impossible today.\nIf implemented, it would have created a Palestinian state on more than 94% of the occupied West Bank.\nThe map Olmert had drawn up now has an almost mythical status. Various interpretations have appeared over the years, but he has never revealed it to the media.\nUntil now.\nIn Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7th October, the latest series from documentary filmmaker Norma Percy available on iPlayer from Monday, Olmert reveals the map he says he showed to Mahmoud Abbas at a meeting in Jerusalem on 16 September 2008.\n\"This is the first time that I expose this map to the media,\" he tells the filmmakers.\nIt shows, in detail, the territory which Olmert proposed to annexe to Israel - 4.9% of the West Bank.\nThat would have included major Jewish settlement blocs - just like previous proposals dating back to the late 1990s.\nIn return, the prime minister said Israel would give up an equal amount of Israeli territory, along the edges of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nThe two Palestinian territories would be connected via a tunnel or highway \u2013 again, something that had been discussed before.\nIn the film, Olmert recalls the Palestinian leader's response.\n\"He said: 'Prime minister, this is very serious. It is very, very, very serious.'\"\nCrucially, Olmert's plan included a proposed solution to the thorny issue of Jerusalem.\nEach side would be able to claim parts of the city as their capital, while administration of the \"holy basin\" - including the Old City, with its religious sites, and adjacent areas - would be handed over to a committee of trustees consisting of Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the US.\nThe implications of the map, for Jewish settlements, would have been colossal.\nHad the plan been implemented, dozens of communities, scattered throughout the West Bank and Jordan Valley, would have been evacuated.\nWhen the previous Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, forcibly removed a few thousand Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it was regarded as a national trauma by those on the Israeli right.\nEvacuating most of the West Bank would have represented an infinitely greater challenge, involving tens of thousands of settlers, with the very real danger of violence.\nBut the test never came.\nAt the end of their meeting, Olmert refused to hand over a copy of the map to Mahmoud Abbas unless the Palestinian leader sign it.\nAbbas refused, saying that he needed to show his experts the map, to make sure they understood exactly what was being offered.\nOlmert says the two agreed to a meeting of map experts the following day.\n\"We parted, you know, like we are about to embark on a historic step forward,\" Olmert says.\nThe meeting never happened. As they drove away from Jerusalem that night, President Abbas's chief of staff, Rafiq Husseini, remembers the atmosphere in the car.\n\"Of course, we laughed,\" he says in the film.\nThe Palestinians believed the plan was dead in the water. Olmert, embroiled in an unrelated corruption scandal, had already announced that he was planning to resign.\n\"It is unfortunate that Olmert, regardless of how nice he was\u2026 was a lame duck,\" Husseini says, \"and therefore, we will go nowhere with this.\"\nThe situation in Gaza also complicated matters. After months of rocket attacks from the Hamas-controlled territory, Olmert ordered a major Israeli assault, Operation Cast Lead, at the end of December, triggering three weeks of intense fighting.\nBut Olmert tells me it would have been \"very smart\" for Abbas to sign the deal. Then, if a future Israeli prime minister tried to cancel it, \"he could have said to the world that the failure was Israel's fault\".\nIsraeli elections followed in February. Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu, a vocal opponent of Palestinian statehood, became prime minister.\nOlmert's plan, and map, faded from view.\nThe former prime minister says he's still waiting for Abbas's reply, but his plan has since joined a long list of missed opportunities to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nIn 1973, the former Israeli diplomat, Abba Eban, quipped that the Palestinians \"never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity\". It's a phrase that Israeli officials have frequently repeated in the years since.\nBut the world is more complicated than that, especially since the two sides signed the historic Oslo Accords in 1993.\nThe peace process ushered in by a handshake on the White House lawn between former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had moments of genuine hope, punctuated by tragedy. Ultimately, it resulted in failure.\nThe reasons are complex and there's plenty of blame to go around but in truth, the stars were never properly aligned.\nI witnessed this non-alignment at first hand 24 years ago.\nIn January 2001, at the Egyptian resort of Taba, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators once again saw the outlines of a deal.\nA member of the Palestinian delegation drew a rough map on a napkin and told me that, for the first time, they were looking at the rough outlines of a viable Palestinian state.\nBut the talks were irrelevant, drowned out by the violence raging on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza, where the second Palestinian uprising, or \"intifada\", had erupted the previous September.\nOnce again, Israel was in the midst of a political transition. Prime Minister Ehud Barak had already resigned. Ariel Sharon comfortably defeated him a few weeks later.\nThe map on the napkin, just like Olmert's map eight years later, showed what might have been.",

        "article_text": "While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world.\nWe have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes.\nWhat is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet.\nA small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes.\n\"People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,\" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City.\nAdvocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product \u2013 coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts.\nAs Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.\nMr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup.\"\nHe founded the company back in 2013 with business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace.\nMr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings.\n\"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.\nFor the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033.\nBy comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up.\nMeanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study.\nBeth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits.\n\"When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,\" she says. \"So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery.\"\nHowever, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was \"was not superior in rehydration\" to normal water.\nJeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world.\nHis family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go.\nHe says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms.\n\"It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,\" he says.\nMr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. \"When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,\" he says.\nMarketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange.\nMr Tomory says he agrees with this approach to make the sap more interesting. \"I know a lot of people have tried just selling the sap as it is, just basic sap from the tree and it's still, but they haven't really caught on,\" he says.\n\"So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation.\"\nBack at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: \"It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,\" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has.\"",

His kicking last year and across the season for Bath has been great. He is a good kicker.\n\"It was the best he has played in the championship. Look at how he got Scotland's backline moving with his passing game. And his kicking game was good too.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'Russell's goal kicking massively disappointing so far'\nEngland fly-half Fin Smith backed up his player-of-the-match performance in round two with another assured display.\nThe Northampton Saint is 10 years younger than Russell and stepped up to kick a pressure penalty from halfway to continue his bid for a spot as one of Farrell's fly-halves.\nIreland fly-half Sam Prendergast, who recently turned 22, is the least experienced contender and won only his sixth cap in Cardiff.\nIreland remain on course for a Grand Slam after Prendergast, who kicked 17 points, helped guide them through a tricky spell when Garry Ringrose was given a 20-minute red card in the 34th minute.\nA particular standout moment came when he spiralled a 50-22 over the head of replacement Wales fly-half Jarrod Evans. The execution was \"utter filth\", according to Barclay.\nHaving backed up his player-of-the-match performance against Scotland, Warburton believes Prendergast has edged into top spot.\n\"Without putting too much pressure on him, I see a world-class top-level 10,\" Warburton told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"You just watch him play and you think 'he is Test level'.

I will go for Hugo Keenan as someone who is just really safe at the back.\"\nEngland wing Tommy Freeman has scored a try in all three rounds this campaign, and showed his power to crash over against Scotland from close range.\nFormer England wing Ugo Monye believes he is a \"dark horse\" to go on tour, with his ability to play centre also enhancing his chances.\n\"I am not sure why he is not in many Lions conversations. His error count is so low and aerially he is so brilliant,\" Monye told BBC's Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"He scored England's only try against Scotland, and changed the game against France with his aerial game to get above Louis Bielle-Biarrey [for his try].\"\nThis video can not be played\nSix Nations Rugby Special: How 'superb' Ireland turned it around\nEngland captain Maro Itoje led from the front by producing crucial turnovers to help his side win back the Calcutta Cup for the first time since 2020.\nThe 30-year-old second row took over as skipper from Jamie George before the Six Nations and is a two-time Lion with six appearances in Tests.\nFormer England scrum-half Matt Dawson told Rugby Union Weekly that Itoje, who in 2021 was voted by his team-mates as player of the series in South Africa, has \"some super-human tendencies\" which could make him a Lions captain.\n\"All of a sudden it feels like he has become the player we all thought he was going to be when he has got the armband on,\" Dawson added.\nNumber eight Caelan Doris missed his side's win over Wales because of injury, but given Farrell made him Ireland captain in 2024 is in a strong position.\nWarburton says any of Doris, Itoje or Wales captain Jac Morgan would make a strong Lions captain, but is leaning towards Itoje.\n\"Doris is definitely captaincy-worthy but the number one criteria for your captain has got to be that he is a banker to start, and I think there are some really good number eights,\" Warburton added.\n\"On form, who is inked in and who has worked with Farrell on Lions tours before?

        "article_text": "We use them to clean the dishes we eat off, but your kitchen sponge is a damp, crumb-filled environment that is perfect for bacteria to thrive in. Should you opt for a washing up brush instead?\nMany species of bacteria know how to rough it out. Some thrive deep within the Earth's crust, or inside boiling hydrothermal vents, and others even call frozen tundra their home. Ask most bacteria where they'd really like to live though, and a kitchen sponge would probably top the list.\u00a0\nYes, it turns out that the very tool we use to clean our plates and glasses is packed full of microbial life. Sponges are bacterial heaven. They're warm, damp, and full of nutritious food crumbs for the microbes to feast on.\u00a0\nIn 2017, Markus Egert, a microbiologist at Furtwangen University in Germany, published new data on the bacterial microbiome of used kitchen sponges. He discovered a whopping 362 species of microbes in those sponges. In some places, the density of bacteria reached up to 54 billion individuals per square centimetre.\u00a0\n\"This is a very big amount, it's similar to the number of bacteria that you would find in a human stool sample,\" says Egert.\u00a0\nSponges are full of holes and pockets \u2013 each providing a niche for a community of microbes to settle down in.\nLingchong You, a synthetic biologist at Duke University, and his team, used computers to model the complex environment of a sponge for a 2022 study. He found that sponges with pockets of varying sizes encouraged the most microbial growth. His team then replicated these results by growing different strains of E.coli in cellulose sponges.\u00a0\n\"They found out that having a variety of different pore sizes in kitchen sponges is something that really matters [for encouraging bacterial growth],\" says Egert. \"This makes sense because, for microbes, you have individualists [such as] bacteria that like to grow on their own, and you have bacteria that need the company of others. Inside a sponge you have so many different structures or niches that everyone gets happy.\"\nSponges definitely make good homes for bacteria. However, it does not necessarily follow that these utensils are also a health risk to us. Bacteria exist everywhere \u2013 on our skin, in the soil, and in the air around us. Not all are harmful, in fact many perform vital jobs. The important question is, therefore, are the bacteria found in sponges even worth worrying about?\nIn Egert's 2017 study, he sequenced the DNA of the most common species. Although it was not possible to identify the exact species of each bacterium, five out of ten of the most prevalent species were closely related to bacteria known to cause infections in people with compromised immune systems. Special cleaning measures such as heating in a microwave or rinsing with hot, soapy water didn't really help either, as although it eliminated some bacteria, it allowed other, more resistant strains, to thrive.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Our hypothesis is that cleaning measures might lead to a kind of selection process, where the few survivors can grow up to large numbers again,\" says Egert. \"If you do this a couple of times, then this might lead to a selection of bacteria that are better adapted to cleaning.\"\nIt's important to note that none of the bacteria found by Egert are linked to food poisoning or severe sickness. In fact, 90% of hospitalisations from food-borne illnesses can be traced to just five pathogens, three of which are bacteria \u2013 Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter. Thankfully, these are quite rare in sponges.\u00a0\n\"We only found potentially pathogenic bacteria, so bacteria that can be dangerous to people with weak immune systems, or the elderly or children,\" says Egert. \"Usually, for a healthy person, the bacteria inside the kitchen sponge are not harmful.\"\u00a0\nIn 2017, Jennifer Quinlan, a professor of food safety at Prairie View A&M University in the US, and her colleagues, collected kitchen sponges from 100 homes in Philadelphia. She found that only 1-2% of those sponges contained bacteria linked to food poisoning in humans. The ones that did contained only small amounts of harmful bacteria.\u00a0\nThis finding was backed up by a 2022 study in which Solveig Langsrud, a scientist at the Norwegian food research institute Nofima, compared the bacteria found in washing up sponges and brushes. She found a common set of harmless non-pathogenic bacteria in both kinds of utensil, including\u00a0Acinetobacter, Chryseobacterium, Enhydrobacter,\u00a0Enterobacteriaceae\u00a0and\u00a0Pseudomonas. However, brushes contained much less bacteria overall.\n\"The vast majority of bacteria on sponges do not cause illness, they're just going to make it smell. They're going to make it unpleasant over time,\" says Quinlan. \"Having said that, there is a possibility that if you use a sponge to wipe up raw meat or raw chicken juice that you could have some of those pathogenic bacteria on there, and studies have found that pathogens can be isolated from kitchen sponges.\"\nSo, while the bacteria growing in your sponge are not usually harmful, if dangerous bacteria such as Salmonella arrive on the scene, the sponge's structure makes it an ideal place for this pathogen to grow.\nThere's evidence this is the case. In Langsrud's study, when the researchers introduced Salmonella to kitchen sponges, they thrived, but when they added this bacteria to brushes, they died. That could be because brushes will often dry out more effectively between uses, killing the Salmonella bacteria, while sponges can still remain damp inside if they are used daily.\nThese potentially pathogenic bacteria can then also be transferred from your sponge to the plates and utensils or surfaces.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The rise of the 'no-wash' movement\n\u2022\u00a0Why vinegar is so good at cleaning\n\u2022\u00a0How often should you wash your towels\nSo, how often should we change our kitchen sponge? Quinlan argues that from a hygiene perspective, ideally you should replace it on a weekly basis, but there are things you can do to prolong its service.\n\"There's two easy ways of cleaning them. You can put them in the dishwasher at the end of the evening, or you can microwave them for a minute until you can see steam coming off. That will kill the majority of the pathogens.\"\nCertainly, studies have shown that putting your sponge through the dishwasher or the microwave can reduce the bacterial load and can be more effective than soaking your sponge in bleach. But as Egbert's study demonstrated, this can then select for more resistant strains and so cleaning will become less effective over time.\nPutting a sponge in boiling water and disinfectant will also kill most bacteria, although some may survive, especially those that form protective gooey biofilms. But this approach has been found to be effective at reducing potential pathogens such as Salmonella.\nOther tips include not storing the sponge in the sink, so that it is allowed to dry in between uses, and really squeezing out the moisture and getting rid of food crumbs. However, some may consider using a different tool entirely in order to clean dishes.\n\"I wouldn't use kitchen sponges at all. It actually does not make sense to me to use such an item inside the kitchen environment,\" says Egert. \"A brush is much better because it contains less bacteria and it dries out more easily. It's also easier to clean.\"\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards that year.\nIn the federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nHe is accused of kidnapping, drugging and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes by using firearms or threatening them with violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, multiple women have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour shortly afterwards, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, and has previously labelled them as \"sickening\" \u2013 suggesting they were \"made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement issued at the start of February - in response to a claim from a lawyer that he would face more than 10 more civil lawsuits - Diddy's own lawyer restated that his client was innocent. \nIn a statement to the BBC in response to the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said:  \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of \"transportation to engage in prostitution\". His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release in the run-up to the trial, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, and describe a culture of widespread violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the request for bail, arguing that Mr Combs was a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses ahead of the sex trafficking trial. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nUS District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled his trial will begin on 5 May.\nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public.\nAll of Mr Combs' court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but not livestreamed.\nMost federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom.\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge. \nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of the sex trafficking charge.",

        "article_text": "In the new series of Influential with Katty Kay, actress and model Brooke Shields opens up about spending nearly six decades in the spotlight and how she finally overcame her imposter syndrome.\nMore than 40 years after Time magazine called her the face of a decade in a 1981 cover story, actress and model Brooke Shields says that she's finally confident enough to not feel like a failure. Speaking to the BBC's Katty Kay for her interview series Influential, Shields opens up about everything from landing an Ivory soap campaign as an infant to the fallout from that infamous Time photo shoot.\nIn 2023, a Hulu documentary, Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields, offered a glimpse into the reality behind the tabloid headlines, centering on the relationship between Shields and her late mother, Teri. With a new book released on 14 January, Brooke Shields\u00a0Is Not Allowed to Get Old: Thoughts on Ageing as a Woman, Shields comes into her own and embraces the difficult task of ageing in the public eye.\nHaving been working since she was an infant (on the aforementioned soap ad), Shields says her public association with youthful beauty - those iconic eyebrows and big hair - has made the ageing process even more of a challenge. \"[Having] a youthful face, just regularly getting older is almost viewed as a disappointment,\" she tells Kay. \"I think, psychologically, it's a very interesting thing\u2026 You really have to do a lot of work on yourself internally to be OK with not also being disappointed with yourself.\"\nShields had early success as a model (she posed for Calvin Klein and Richard Avedon aged 15) and then as an actress, when she starred in films like The Blue Lagoon (1980) and Endless Love (1981).\n\"I was the original influencer, actually,\" she jokes.\nSince then, she has parlayed her fame into partnerships with skincare brands, launched her own haircare line, Commence, and an online platform for women over 40, Beginning is Now. It's that community that she's embracing with her new book, with the realisation that some are starting to see her as a 59-year-old, not just the girl who starred in Pretty Baby.\nBeing so strongly associated with a decade hasn't helped shift public perception, even though she has worked consistently since then. \"It was a shock to me the first time I saw a wrinkle on a monitor, because I thought something was in the film,\" she says, revealing that she sometimes mistakenly believed she was immune to the passage of time. \"I knew that I had to find value beyond the surface and looks and beauty, because it was such a part of my upbringing and who I was to people.\"\nShields acknowledges that she's spent much of her life keeping up appearances, but she's had the privilege to see that Hollywood's focus on eternal youth isn't necessarily a universally held belief around the world.\n\"It's definitely a very American thing. I think you go to Europe \u2013 I'm not sure about the UK as much, but definitely in Italy and France \u2013 there is a certain respect and reverence for beauty, mature beauty,\" she says. \"We don't \u2013 we have not figured that out yet. I think, I hope it's changing a bit. I'm hoping to contribute to that.\"\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\nShe calls ageing liberating, not limiting. While Hollywood has been more welcoming of women of a certain age \u2013 just look at Demi Moore, Martha Stewart and Jennifer Coolidge's recent renaissances \u2013 Shields explains that there's a selfishness that arrives when things like children and career pressures aren't on the agenda anymore.\n\"I think that there's a freedom to it and there's so many different factors that when you delve into them, you understand why this is a prime of our life in a way that is focused on just us,\" she says. \"Not our biological clock, not societal pressures, not all of these things that we operate by \u2013 because your time runs out.\"\nShields's career since the 90s has been marked by focused diversification; exploring ways to find success away from her appearance. Her CV includes a Broadway stint in shows like Chicago, Cabaret and Grease, in addition to her TV and film work. She has published two children's books and written about postpartum depression. She is also mother to two daughters, Grier and Rowan, and earned a degree in romance languages and literatures from Princeton University.\n\"When you start to write books or take jobs in other mediums and you learn different skills, [like] Broadway, speaking, all of those things that sort of add to you as a human being, the onus on just looking a certain way or on [being] 'the face of a decade', which is ridiculous in and of itself,\" she says. \"I was a pretty face but you know, really?\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Entrepreneur Jane Wurwand on why 'high-touch will overshadow high-tech' in business\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\n\u2022 Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn explains the mindset of a winner\nShields says this self-reflection is what allowed her to finally feel able to rub shoulders with her peers. She tells Kay that during an event for the opening of Sunset Boulevard with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, she realised that she could hold her own. The imposter syndrome that had loomed over her years in the spotlight had evaporated.\n\"Everything that I've done and been and seen and grown from and learned gives me the opportunity to not be intimidated by any of these people in these rooms. I can admire them and I can look up to them and love their talent,\" Shields says. \"I can be good enough. I'm as good as [whomever] I used to hold up on a pedestal.\"\u00a0\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

It turned a good night for the Australian into a great one.\nFor Inglis, Australia's match-winner who was born and raised in Yorkshire, supports the Sky Blues.\nThe 29-year-old lived on the outskirts of Leeds until he was 14, played for Yorkshire's youth teams and when named Sportsman of the Year at St Mary's Comprehensive in Menston, was presented with an award by the Kaiser Chiefs - the famous musical sons of the West Yorkshire city.\nInglis even admitted to still supporting England as recently as 2017 while trying to win a place in Australia's XI.\n\"Those days are long gone, I think,\" said the right-hander, shortly after his innings propelled Australia to the highest run-chase in the 50-year history of cricket's global white-ball events.\nA 13-year-old Josh Inglis received an award for outstanding sporting achievement from the Kaiser Chiefs in his school days on the outskirts of Bradford\nInglis moved to Western Australia as a 15-year-old when his England-born mum, Sarah, and father, Martin, who was born in Coventry hence the football allegiance, moved the family down under. Any hint of a Yorkshire twang was left on t' plane.\nHe now speaks with a broad Australian accent, has a thick moustache and addressed the media with his cap backwards and sliders on his feet.\nThere were no split loyalties during his stunning assault.\nAustralia were 136-4 when Inglis began - England overwhelming favourites with Adil Rashid, Inglis' former Yorkshire second XI team-mate, spinning a web.\nHe began by timing the ball to all corners of Lahore before flogging England's bowlers whenever they dropped too short. By the end, he was playing the trademark shot of another Yorkshireman - Joe Root - with a reverse scoop over the third man rope.\nIt meant a chase of 352, the ninth-highest in one-day international history, was completed with 15 balls to spare.\nInglis has flickered in international cricket but the past month has been his breakout moment. He scored a Test century on debut last month but ranks this as his greatest day.\n\"It was really special,\" Inglis said. \"Under the circumstances, in an ICC [International Cricket Council] event, you want to have an impact and win a game.\"\nFor much of Saturday it looked like Ben Duckett who had landed the warning shots before this winter's Ashes, followed by Jofra Archer and Mark Wood with their dismissals of Travis Head and Steve Smith.\nIt may in fact be Inglis who has done the most to aid his cause of striding out at Perth on 21 November.\nFor the side Inglis used to support, talk of the Ashes must wait. There were no clouds in Lahore, but for England - beaten in 11 of their past 15 matches - it still poured.\nThis was the day their batting finally clicked \u2013 the highest score in Champions Trophy reached, only for a player born in their heartlands to better it. Sometimes you can only smile.\n\"I just think, you've got to sometimes credit the opposition,\" said a phlegmatic captain Jos Buttler. \"I thought Josh Inglis played a fantastic innings.\"\nThis time, it is hard to argue.\nThis video can not be played\n'Oh no!' - Archer drops sitter to gift Carey half-century\nIn making a superb 165, Duckett played how most have requested. The attacking intent was reined in, gaps worked and a score steadily built rather than thrown up in a hurry.\nEngland's top order has been asked to score hundreds \u2013 to overcome their tendency to start well and depart - and Duckett produced England's highest score in a Champions Trophy or World Cup.\nTheir score of 351-8 was the highest at a Champions Trophy. Another 30 may not have mattered the way Inglis was going.\nIn truth, England's biggest failure on this occasion was not made in Lahore on Saturday but before Christmas in London \u2013 or at least after Jacob Bethell pulled a hamstring in Nagpur.\nTheir squad has four wicketkeepers, one specialist spinner and one batting all-rounder, meaning England will always lose their fight in search of the perfect balance.\nWith four frontline bowlers against Australia, Buttler had nowhere to turn when Brydon Carse had his most difficult day to date in an England shirt \u2013 even if Liam Livingstone and Joe Root performed admirably as the fifth bowler.\nIt leaves a feeling that Bethell's injury was more damaging to England than it first appeared, given his left-arm spin would have provided another option.\nWithout him Buttler now faces a defining week in his reign as England's white-ball captain.\nAfter a dismal defence of their 50-over world title in 2023 and an uninspired attempt at retaining their T20 crown last year, he cannot afford a group-stage exit here.\nMatthew Mott was dispensable enough to take the fall for the previous failures but Brendon McCullum, given the keys to all England sides to mould as he pleases until 2027, is not. Instead, it will be Buttler in the firing line if this group stage is not turned around.\nNext is Afghanistan in four days' time \u2013 a side who beat England during the World Cup 16 months ago \u2013 and then South Africa, some people's favourite for the title, with wins likely to be needed in both.\nEngland have questions again and some do not have an easy answer.

Inglis has given England the (sky) blues.Related topicsEngland Men's Cricket TeamYorkshireAustraliaCricketMore on this storyLeeds-born Inglis leads Australia to victory over EnglandPublished2 days agoGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished31 January Another 30 may not have mattered the way Inglis was going.In truth, England's biggest failure on this occasion was not made in Lahore on Saturday but before Christmas in London \u2013 or at least after Jacob Bethell pulled a hamstring in Nagpur.Their squad has four wicketkeepers, one specialist spinner and one batting all-rounder, meaning England will always lose their fight in search of the perfect balance.With four frontline bowlers against Australia, Buttler had nowhere to turn when Brydon Carse had his most difficult day to date in an England shirt \u2013 even if Liam Livingstone and Joe Root performed admirably as the fifth bowler.It leaves a feeling that Bethell's injury was more damaging to England than it first appeared, given his left-arm spin would have provided another option.Without him Buttler now faces a defining week in his reign as England's white-ball captain.After a dismal defence of their 50-over world title in 2023 and an uninspired attempt at retaining their T20 crown last year, he cannot afford a group-stage exit here.Matthew Mott was dispensable enough to take the fall for the previous failures but Brendon McCullum, given the keys to all England sides to mould as he pleases until 2027, is not. There were no clouds in Lahore, but for England - beaten in 11 of their past 15 matches - it still poured.This was the day their batting finally clicked \u2013 the highest score in Champions Trophy reached, only for a player born in their heartlands to better it.",

One country's secret order risks putting all of us in danger and it should be stopped.\"\nTwo senior US politicians said it was so serious a threat to American national security that the US government should re-evaluate its intelligence-sharing agreements with the UK unless it was withdrawn.\nIt is not clear that Apple's actions will fully address those concerns, as the IPA order applies worldwide and ADP will continue to operate in other countries.\nOne of those US politicians - Senator Ron Wyden - told BBC News that Apple withdrawing end-to-end encrypted backups from the UK \"creates a dangerous precedent which authoritarian countries will surely follow\". \nSenator Wyden believes the move will \"not be enough\" for the UK to drop its demands, which would \"seriously threaten\" the privacy of US users.\nIn its statement, Apple said it regretted the action it had taken.\n\"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" it said.\n\"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\"\nRani Govender, policy manager for child safety online at the NSPCC, said it wants tech firms like Apple to ensure they are balancing child and user safety with privacy.\n\"As Apple looks to change its approach to encryption, we're calling on them to make sure that they also implement more child safety measures, so that children are properly protected on their services,\" she told BBC News.\nThe UK children's charity has said that end-to-end encrypted services can hinder child safety and protection efforts, such as identifying the sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\nBut Emily Taylor, the co-founder of Global Signal Exchange which provides insights into supply-chain scams, said that encryption was more about protecting consumer privacy and that it is not the same as the dark web where CSAM is usually distributed.\n\"The trouble with this long-running debate, zero-sum debate about encryption and child protection is that the tech companies can come out sounding incredibly callous, but that's not the point,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme.\n\"Encryption is something that we use every day; whether its communicating with our bank, whether its on messaging apps that are end-to-end encrypted, encryption is a form of privacy in an otherwise very insecure online world.\"\nThe row comes amid growing push-back in the US against regulation being imposed on its tech sector from elsewhere.\nIn a speech at the AI Action Summit in Paris at the beginning of February, US Vice President JD Vance made it clear that the US was increasingly concerned about it. \n\"The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on US tech companies with international footprints,\" he said.",

        "article_text": "Liverpool players celebrate the win at Manchester City that points them 11 points clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League\nLiverpool's rain-soaked, jubilant supporters called it with 90 seconds remaining of a statement win over Manchester City.\n\"We're going to win the league\" echoed around a sea of empty sky blue seats at Etihad Stadium, as Liverpool closed out the win that leaves them 11 points clear at the top of the table.\nAnd they are right. Liverpool are going to win the league. \nHead coach Arne Slot's seamless transition from Jurgen Klopp will be rewarded with the prize Liverpool's great old managers such as Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan coveted above all others, the \"bread and butter\" as they called it.\nThe 2-0 win here, bolted on to Arsenal's loss at home to West Ham on Saturday, means that, although there can be thousands of words spent on dancing around the subject, this season's title race is done and dusted.\nEtihad Stadium has witnessed many title celebrations in recent seasons. This looked and sounded like another one. The difference being this was Liverpool's fans chanting \"hand it over\" rather than the playing out of another addition to Pep Guardiola's roll of honour.\nThe race may not be run mathematically and football can be a strange, unpredictable game. It is not, however, so strange and unpredictable that a remorseless Liverpool team who have lost only one league game all season, at home to Nottingham Forest in September, will lose an 11-point advantage with only 11 matches left.\nAnd seven of those games are at Anfield. The game is up for Arsenal. Their game in hand carries decreasing significance.\nLiverpool can now afford some slip-ups, not that Slot will want that, and even if they do, Arsenal will have to win almost every game, something that looks beyond a side with a propensity to slip under pressure.\nThis video can not be played\nHappy to win at Etihad Stadium - Arne Slot\nSlot, understandably, was cautious.\n\"In every other league, having a lead like would be very comfortable, but not in this league,\" he said. \"There is a challenge in every game. We even saw Plymouth Argyle challenging us in the FA Cup.\n\"The fans can sing what they want but we know how hard we have to work. Someone asked me after we drew at Aston Villa whether we were having a dip. I never believed that and I'm not going to say anything now.\"\nSeemingly insurmountable leads have been surrendered at the top of the Premier League in the past, but very few as big as the one Liverpool now hold. Not at this stage of the season.\nThe only one bearing any comparison was during the 1997-98 campaign, when Manchester United were 11 points clear of Arsenal on 2 March and were reeled in.\nHowever, they had already lost five games at that point and had proved they were far from infallible. Liverpool have that Forest defeat as the only blemish on their league record.\nAnd the wonderful Arsenal side under Arsene Wenger that chased United down were a very different proposition to the current crop under Mikel Arteta, who are destined to be the title race's nearly men again.\nGuardiola declined the opportunity to crown Liverpool champions, but effectively answered the question with two more questions: \"How many points are they away from Arsenal? How many games have they lost?\"\nSay no more.\nHe made a point of warmly congratulating Slot at the final whistle before seeking out every Liverpool player for a handshake. Guardiola knows a title-winning side when he sees it, and he was looking at one right here.\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, former England goalkeeper and Match of the Day pundit Joe Hart said \"there's no way back\" for Arsenal in the title race.\n\"They can do what they want, they can win every game from here, but I still don't think it will be enough,\" he added.\nLiverpool's dominance of this Premier League season is further underlined by the statistics that show they are superior in so many metrics that matter.\nSlot's machine has scored more goals than every other team with 64. Liverpool are top of the shots, with 452, as well as shots on target, with 173.\nAs the table above shows, they aren't just top of the league - they're top of nearly every metric you could use to measure their success.\nAnd at the heart of it all is Mohamed Salah, who opened the scoring with his 30th goal of the season before creating the second for Dominik Szoboszlai, effectively wrapping up the win before half-time.\nThe 'Egyptian King' has now scored 30 goals or more in five separate seasons for Liverpool, putting him level with Roger Hunt and Ian Rush. \nSalah also has 21 assists this season, a remarkable total of 51 contributions to goals before the end of February.\nAnd victory here at Etihad Stadium, a huge moment in the season, may just taste a little sweeter because it came at the club who have denied Liverpool in tight title races before. Twice, a Guardiola-led City have done it to them on the final day.\nLiverpool had won only one of their previous 15 league games away to City before this. Victory will have made up for those disappointments.\nIt would be no surprise if the closing stages of this league season turns into a Liverpool procession.\nPremature? Not really. It is now a case of when rather than if the red ribbons adorn the silverware.\nStart the car. Or in this case, the open-topped parade bus.\nThis video can not be played\nMOTD Analysis: Liverpool's dominant red wall\nSlot has brought his own touches to what Jurgen Klopp bequeathed him, which was an outstanding squad fit for purpose for a title tilt, aided and abetted by the astonishing collapse of Guardiola's all-conquering Manchester City after a historic four successive titles.\nLiverpool may not quite produce the fireworks that accompanied Klopp's so-called \"heavy metal football\", but they still have the fearsome Salah - and Slot's addition of a ruthless efficiency has made them the full package this season.\nThe emotion-fuelled thrills of the Klopp era are now fused on to the ice-cold approach of Slot. \nHe has taken on the task of succeeding an icon and actually improved Liverpool.\nThe champions-elect had just 33.9% possession in the win at City, their lowest in a Premier League victory since current Opta records started in 2003-04.\nThey also had fewer shots, eight to City's 16, and fewer touches inside the box, 27 to City's 40.\n\"That was a proper business-like performance from Liverpool,\" said Hart. \"They looked like they had a contingency plan for any threat - well, the minimal threat - by City that they did feel they were vulnerable to.\n\"They executed that really well, then everyone else took care of their own business where they thought they could dominate.\n\"They were completely in control and comfortable everywhere on the pitch.\"\nCity may have had more possession, but Liverpool keeper Alisson hardly had any serious work to do.\nThe second half was a formality, for all City's efforts, as so much floundered on the flanks while Slot's team posed a huge threat on the counter.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

Roberta broke boundaries and records. She was also a proud educator.\"\nFlack had previously announced in 2022 that she had motor neurone disease, and could no longer sing.\nBorn in North Carolina and raised in Arlington, Virginia, the musician started out as a classical pianist. She gained a full school scholarship to Howard University aged just 15. Her classical training led her into teaching, but at night she'd accompany opera singers on piano, singing pop standards during the breaks.\n\"The whole while I was studying classical music, especially in my younger years, I was also doing a lot of doo-ron-ron, shoo-doo-bee-doo, all of that stuff, with my peers, so I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by music all of my life, the Bach and the Chopin and the Schumann on one hand, and all the rhythm and blues,\" she explained.\nHer recording career started after she was discovered singing in a jazz club by musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known\".\nBut she didn't score her first hit until she was in her 30s - when her recording of Ewan MacColl's The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face was used to soundtrack an explicit love scene in Clint Eastwood's 1971 film Play Misty For Me.\nIt was subsequently named song of the year at the Grammys. Flack won the award a second time the following year, for Killing Me Softly With His Song.\nAfter topping the charts again in 1974 with Feel Like Makin' Love, Flack took a break from performing to concentrate on recording and charitable causes.\nShe spent much of the 1980s touring and over the course of her career, worked with artists including Donny Hathaway and Miles Davis.\nIn 1991 she returned to the charts with a duet with Maxi Priest called Set the Night to Music (from the album of the same name).\n She also recorded an album of Beatles covers, called Let It Be Roberta, in 2012.\nAccording to the Guardian, Flack once told a journalist: \"What I consider myself is a soulful singer, in that I try to sing with all the feeling that I have in my body and my mind.\n\"A person with true soul is one who can take anybody's song and transcend all the flaws, the technique and just make you listen.\"\nOnce married, to US jazz musician Stephen Novosel, the star devoted a lot of her time to the Roberta Flack School of Music in New York.\nReverend Jesse Jackson once described her as \"socially relevant and politically unafraid\".\nIn 2020, a year after having a stroke, Flack was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Grammys.\n\"It's a tremendous and overwhelming honour,\" she said at the time. \n\"I've tried my entire career to tell stories through my music. This award is a validation to me that my peers heard my thoughts and took in what I have tried to give.\"\n\nFlack's most famous song was introduced to a new generation of music fans when Lauryn Hill's hip-hop group The Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of Killing Me Softly, which they would eventually perform on-stage alongside her.\nIt topped the charts around the world in 1996.",

        "article_text": "Rorschach tests play with the human imagination and our mind's ability to impart meaning onto the world around us \u2013 but what does AI see in them?\nFor more than a century, the Rorschach inkblot test has been widely used as a window into people's personality.\nEven if you haven't done one yourself, you'll recognise the mirrored ink smudges that form ambiguous shapes on cards. Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.\nFor decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.\nYou might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.\nWhile many psychologists today believe the test is now obsolete and has little credibility as a psychometric tool, it is still used in some parts of the world and is even used as part of courtroom evidence, although this is controversial. Rorschach never intended it to be a measure of personality, but rather a way of identifying disordered thinking in patients, such as those with schizophrenia. Some psychologists, however, still believe it is useful as a tool in therapy as a way of encouraging self-reflection or starting conversations.\n\"When a person interprets a\u00a0Rorschach\u00a0image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases,\" says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. \"The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience.\"\nFinding meaning or familiar shapes in inkblots relies upon a number of cognitive processes that humans use every day, including memory, emotion and the ability to deal with ambiguity.\nBut what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a \"brain\" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind?\nRecent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT means it's now possible to put that to the test. So-called \"multimodal models\" can accept image-based inputs and provide responses as easily as they are to interact with text-based prompts thanks to their machine vision capabilities.\nWe gave ChatGPT five of the 10 common images used in an inkblot test to see how it would interpret the images. But the AI system's training data \u2013 information that helps establish its \"knowledge\", makes it trickier to do so.\nAI v the Mind\nThis article is part of\u202fAI v the Mind, a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge AI and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? We hope to find out.\u00a0\nShowing the AI model the first inkblot card from an online database of inkblots, which is commonly interpreted by humans as a bat, butterfly or moth, highlighted just how literal AI vision algorithms can be.\n\"This image is a Rorschach inkblot, often used in psychological assessments to explore perception and interpretation,\" the chatbot replied. \"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination.\"\nPretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. \"For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched,\" the chatbot responded. \"The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!\"\nThe chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image \u2013 a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. \"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched \u2013 perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically,\" the chatbot wrote. \"The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings.\"\n\"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test,\" says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer who a decade ago asked a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.)\u00a0\n\"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots,\" says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist.\n\"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking \u2013 instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset,\" says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, \"If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture.\"\nWhat we get is a facsimile of reality \u2013 and of thought. \"ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them,\" Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. \"ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings,\" he says.\nGhosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users \u2013 which gives the impression of \"thinking\", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption \u2013 but it can muddy the waters around how they \u2013 and their outputs \u2013 are perceived.\nOne way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh. Present ChatGPT with the same inkblot image to analyse, and it may well come up with a totally different interpretation in the same conversation.\nWhen we gave ChatGPT the same image twice, the AI did indeed give different responses.\n\"A human would typically stick to their previous answer because personal experiences and emotions influence their responses,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, ChatGPT generates responses based on its dataset.\"\nThat's part of the problem when trying to infer meaning in what ChatGPT says about the inkblots it sees: the chatbot is simply regurgitating what its training data has encountered.\nThis is perhaps best demonstrated by an experiment by researchers at the MediaLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US. They trained an AI algorithm called \"Norman\" \u2013 named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates \u2013 on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman described seeing a man being electrocuted.\nIt is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data.\nBut what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker \u2013 in part because of what it says, rather than what it \"knows\" (AI systems know nothing innately). \"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed,\" says Dekker. \"I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had \u2013 or created \u2013 a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?\"\nWhile this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle. Similarly, a few stickers on a stop sign can render it invisible to the algorithm \u2013 a potential risk for a self-driving car. (Read more about the 'weird events' that make machines hallucinate.)\nAI algorithms are particularly good at spotting patterns, but those differing responses to a single ambiguous image also highlight an aspect of the human mind that AI can't replicate: the emotions and unconscious meanings we attach to things we encounter in the world around us. There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. \"It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image.\"\nAnd that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. \"The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Starring Fernanda Torres and centring on a family torn apart by Brazil's military dictatorship, I'm Still Here is up for three major awards \u2013 and could pull off an upset on the night.\nWhen the Oscar nominations were announced, the surprising strength of Walter Salles's I'm Still Here \u2013 with nods for Fernanda Torres as best actress, best international film and most unexpected of all best picture \u2013 caused celebrations in Brazil. \"I'm so proud! Kisses to Fernanda Torres and Walter Salles,\" the country's president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, posted on X. Emotionally powerful and eloquent, the film tells the real-life story of a family living under Brazil's two-decade military dictatorship, which ended in 1985. In 1971, Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), a former congressman, was taken by military police and never seen again, leaving his wife, Eunice (Torres), to create a future for herself and her five children. In the following years, as Eunice returns to school and becomes a prominent human rights lawyer, she never stops trying to find the truth about her husband's fate and to hold the state accountable. And on the day the nominations were announced, 23 January, the film and reality intersected again. Paiva's death certificate, which had declared him missing, was amended to reflect the reality that his death was \"violent, caused by the Brazilian state\".\nI'm Still Here is an Oscar dark horse and much more. It now looks like the frontrunner in the international category, and Torres has at least a realistic chance of upsetting the best actress frontrunner, Demi Moore. Behind those nominations is an alchemical mix of the personal, the political and the artistic. Few films have depicted the devastating effects of politics on individuals in such an intimate, visceral or timely way, arriving at a moment when the rise of authoritarianism has become a global concern.\n\"I was always tempted by filmic narratives in which the journey of the characters somehow blends with the journey of a country,\" Salles tells the BBC. And while the film is explicitly about the Brazilian dictatorship, and has been a big commercial hit in that country \u2013 becoming the highest-grossing homegrown film there since the pandemic \u2013 it has also touched audiences around the world. Its global box-office numbers are remarkable for a low-budget film: more than $25m, including more than $3m in just a month in the US, where it is still playing strongly in cinemas.\nThe film's awards journey has been propelled by its impact in Brazil, where Torres is a major star with an enormous social media following. Isabela Boscov, a Brazilian journalist and film critic, tells the BBC: \"What is really unusual in Brazil is a film that is not a comedy having that sort of box office. That hasn't happened in years and years.\" She attributes the success to a combination of factors, including Torres's popularity, how realistically the film captures 1970s Brazil, and the national mood. The country's recent history has been tumultuous. Jair Bolsonaro's far-right government was in power from 2019 to 2023. When he lost the 2022 election, his supporters stormed the Congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court, and last year Bolsonaro was formally accused of allegedly plotting a coup. \"Walter Salles has this gift for encapsulating exactly what the country needs, for really touching the zeitgeist,\" Boscov says. \"At the moment Brazil is a very divided country in terms of thought and ideology. And I think half of the country would like to face whatever happened in the past [during the dictatorship], so as to prevent it from happening again.\nAll the attention and manoeuvring wouldn't have mattered, of course, if voters and audiences weren't responding so strongly to the film itself. Although it deals with tragedy, it is also full of warmth, and begins with scenes of the Paiva family and their friends, laughing and dancing at dinners and at the beach, living a full life. \u00a0Salles knew the family personally as a young teenager in Rio de Janeiro. \"I was invited into that house, into the intimacy of that family. I was enamoured of it,\" he says. Recreating its atmosphere is a way of welcoming viewers into the film. The family is always aware of the dangers around them, though. Driving home from a film, one of the teenage daughters and her friends is pulled over and questioned by police.\nSalles's films include Central Station (1998), which was also nominated for the international film Oscar and, with what turns out to be poignant symmetry, in the best actress category for Torres's mother, Fernanda Montenegro, who plays the older Eunice in I'm Still Here. Creating I'm Still Here took seven years, he says, partly because \"there were so many layers of memory involved that I wanted to be faithful to\". He was inspired to make the film after reading the 2015 memoir by Rubens and Eunice's son, Marcelo Paiva, who began writing it when \"his mother, who had fought to preserve the family's memory for decades, was falling into the abyss of Alzheimer's, and therefore losing her memory at a time where the country was starting to lose its collective memory,\" Salles says. That story offered what he calls \"a double reflection\" on the past.\nReminding viewers of his country's past was crucial to Salles, and was another reason getting the film made took so long. \"It would have been unthinkable to shoot this film during the Bolsonaro years,\" he says. \"We would not have had permission to shoot in public spaces. Basically, we would have been able to shoot the interiors, but not the exteriors of the film. This certainly added three or four years to the development.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Why it's one of the closest Oscar races ever\n\u2022\u00a0Category fraud is the latest Oscars scandal\n\u2022\u00a0The real-life history behind The Brutalist \u00a0\nSalles says of the real-life woman, \"Eunice is a character who refused melodrama,\" a quality that infuses the film and Torres's sophisticated, powerfully restrained performance. As she watches her husband taken away from their front door, calmly driving his own car as if to a friendly meeting, Eunice gives a slight, reassuring smile, but her face is a wrenching image of sorrow beneath the calm facade. Torres always allows us to see the grief and pain beneath the restraint. After Rubens' disappearance, Salles says, she was determined \"not to bend to an authoritarian regime, never to allow herself to be portrayed as a victim\". He points to \"this extraordinary idea of whenever they wanted her to cry on camera, she would do the exact opposite, which is to smile\". A scene in the film recreates just that, when a journalist asks the family not to smile for a photograph, and Eunice insists that they do.\nIt took until 1996 for her to get a death certificate at all, the first one that erroneously listed the cause of death as \"missing\". In the film she proudly shows reporters the certificate and says, \"Forced disappearances were one of the cruellest acts of the regime because you kill one person but condemn all the others to eternal psychological torture.\" Capturing that enduring grief and uncertainty is one of the film's most original, affecting accomplishments.\nEven Salles couldn't have foreseen exactly how timely the film might become, although he says, \"When we shot the film, we were already aware that the fragility of democracy was something that wasn't only pertinent to Brazil anymore. It was pertinent to too many countries in the world.\" One of the first things authoritarians routinely do, he says, is \"to try to erase memory and somewhat rewrite history\". Preserving that memory and history, personal and political, goes to the heart of I'm Still Here. Salles says: \"I think one of the reasons the film echoed so strongly in Brazil with audiences is because they were embracing the humanity of that family, but they were also seeing a reflection of themselves on the screen, and they were accessing a part of Brazilian history that had been forgotten for too long.\"\nI'm Still Here is out in US cinemas now and released in the UK on 21 February.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Kyiv and Washington are close to signing a deal over US access to Ukraine's mineral deposits, a Ukrainian minister says.\nOlga Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said on X that \"negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalised\". \nShe added that \"we are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature\".\nUkraine has been facing growing pressure from the US administration to sign the deal, which has ended up in the centre of the growing rift between the US and Ukrainian presidents.\nZelensky first included the offer of an agreement on minerals in the so-called \"victory plan\" that he presented to Trump last September.\nThe idea was to offer the then presidential candidate a tangible reason for the US to continue supporting Ukraine.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson told the BBC in Kyiv that such a deal was \"the great prize\" because it would secure \"a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.  This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral.\nGraphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine's global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nOn Monday, ahead of a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told US news outlet NewsNation that the deal was \"about growing the pie economically and binding the US and Ukraine together for the future\". \nPrior to Stefanishyna's assertion that a deal was close, there appeared to be several sticking points.\nLast Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a reported 50% share of its rare earth minerals - which Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.\n\"I can't sell our state,\" he said.\nThe provisions of a second draft of the deal on Sunday appeared to be even tougher than in the first document.\nInstead of 50/50 revenue split, the revised draft suggested the US wanted full control, Zelensky told journalists at the press conference on Sunday.\nTrump said earlier this month that the US military and economic aid to Ukraine amounts to about $500bn (\u00a3396bn), and he wants the US to have access to Ukrainian minerals of that value.\nHowever, Zelensky has said that the American assistance so far totals around $100bn (\u00a379bn). Kyiv has also insisted that the aid they have received until now was a grant and not a credit, and so Ukraine has no obligation to return anything.\nZelenzky is also said to want any deal to include security guarantees.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson called an agreement for US access to Ukraine's minerals \"the great prize\".\nHe rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\" but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argued that if they can attract American investors to develop their natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to offering the US access to Russia's rare minerals, in order to counter a potential deal between the US and Ukraine.\nIn a televised interview on Russian state-owned broadcaster Rossiya 1, he said it would include access to Russia's \"new territories\" - those it has seized and occupied in Ukraine since their invasion three years ago.\n\"We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine,\" Putin said, adding Russia was ready to \"attract foreign partners\".",

This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.\nMr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.\n\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".\nRita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration. \nAccording to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.\n\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.\nMs de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"\nAntonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.\n\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"\nEven with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.\nNow in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.\n\"But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.\"\nMr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.\n\"Up until today I never thought about it.\"\nMr Dias agrees: \"Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there\".",

        "article_text": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language.\nMy mother's name is the colour of milk. The strings of an acoustic guitar, when strummed, play the warm yellow of honeycomb. The sound is flat, hard and smooth. And Monday is pink. These sensations are always the same, and always present. This is synaesthesia \u2013 in my case grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and sound-texture synaesthesia.\nLike many synaesthetes, I discovered at a young age I had a flair for both music and languages. In music, it wasn't the physical act of performing I excelled at, but composition. I went on to become a composer for short films and dance theatre, and a sound editor for television. Writing music felt a lot like a language to me, as I \"saw\" the colours of the sounds in a similar way. I also studied French, German, Spanish and linguistics \u2013 the colour of language helping me to remember words as well as the patterns of grammar.\nSynaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that causes an estimated 4.4% of people to experience the world as a cacophony of sensations. Around\u00a060 different types of synaesthesia\u00a0have been identified, but there could be more than 100, with some types\u00a0experienced in clusters.\nThe condition is thought to be caused by genetically inherited traits that affect the structural and functional development of the brain. Increased communication between sensory regions in the brain means, for example, words can stimulate taste, sequences of numbers may be perceived in spatial arrangements, or the feel of textures\u00a0might conjure\u00a0emotions.\nSynaesthesia is not considered to be a neurological disorder and \u2013 although it has been linked to neurodevelopmental\u00a0and mental health conditions including autism, anxiety and schizophrenia \u2013 it is described as an \"alternative perceptual reality\" and generally thought to be beneficial.\n\"When I was younger\u00a0I knew I saw the world in a different way, and my way of describing that to others was 'colourful',\" says Smadar Frisch.\nFrisch, who has grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and lexical\u2013gustatory synaesthesia \u2013 where words have taste \u2013 explores the world of senses through her podcast, Chromatic Minds, and is currently writing her first book on the subject. \"Learning in school was too much for me sensory-wise,\" she says. \"It is very difficult trying to solve an equation\u00a0when all the colouring of a series of numbers was a psychedelic\u00a0blast.\"\nThis explosion of colour, says Frisch, would cause her to lose focus and forget what she was doing. \"[It was the] same with language. The words' colours, music and taste sensations ignited me and I wanted to express myself so much \u2013 that I lost focus.\"\nIt wasn't until she'd almost finished high school that she came across Richard Cytowic and David Eagleman's book, Wednesday is Indigo blue. \"My initial thought was that Wednesday is actually orange \u2013 and I needed to get this book.\" This was a turning point for Frisch.\u00a0\"I finally understood how my synaesthete brain is linked and wired. And I thought to myself, this phenomenon is amazing. I can use the colours to help me learn, rather than confuse me.\"\nFrisch developed a colour coding system to help her learn new languages\u00a0fluently and quickly. Studying languages no longer felt confusing but \"organised\", she says. \"And it worked! My whole world changed. I went on to learn the thing my brain was meant to excel in: languages.\"\nFrisch says she was able to learn French and Spanish fluently in just two months. \"I scored 90+ on each [French and Spanish] exam,\" she says. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently \u2013 and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\".\nJulia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. She and her team tested around 6,000 children who were six to 10 years old. \"We screened each one individually for synaesthesia, and then gave [them] a battery of tests to determine what skills come with synaesthesia,\" she says.\nThe study found that the children with synaesthesia were better in a number of skills than the children without \u2013 skills which, according to Simner, would \"certainly help both first and second language learning\".\n\"Specifically, they were significantly better in\u00a0receptive vocabulary (how many words they could understand), productive vocabulary (how many words they knew how to say), short term memory store, attention to detail and creativity,\" Simner says. \"These syn-linked skills predict that we might well expect second-language learning to be easier for someone with synaesthesia.\"\nHaving synaesthetic colours, she says, makes letters more memorable. And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"The way these colours seep across languages can either be via the way the letter looks or the way the letter sounds,\" says Simner. \"It's like the colour scaffolds across from one language to another.\"\nIn 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning \u2013 allowing a person to \"see\" patterns \u2013 an ability critical to language learning.\nThe researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words \u2013 for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" \u2013 representing\u00a0an artificial \"language\".\nThey then listened to a second set of words. This set included the original artificial words, plus new artificial words which represented a \"foreign\" language. The participants were then asked to distinguish \"words\" from each of the two artificial languages.\n\"It didn't have meaning,\" says Amy Finn, psychologist and director of the University of Toronto's cognitive neuroscience and developmental laboratory, Finn Land Lab. \"It was constructed to look at 'segmentation' \u2013 or how you use regularities to pull out what the segments of language\u00a0even are. This is a very early but super important problem in early language learning.\"\nThe results showed grapheme-colour synaesthetes were better able to differentiate between the two \"languages\" than participants who didn't have synaesthesia. \"We think [synaesthesia] can help you parse the chunks of language more easily,\" says Finn.\nWhen synaesthetes experience the same patterns with more than one sense \u2013 for example, both aurally\u00a0and\u00a0visually \u2013 their mind conjures a bonus secondary cue which can help them recognise or remember the pattern.\nTake 11-year-old me, put on the spot in my first week of secondary school. \"How do you say 'work'?\" demands my French teacher. The class is silent. I know the word is blue. Then it comes to me. \"Travail,\" I answer. Sometimes I can't remember a word \u2013 but I can remember the colour. This can be frustrating because no one can help me if I say \"it's pink\", as the colours are unique to my own mind. On the other hand, colour acts as an extra reminder, a bonus cue I can put to use when learning languages.\nYou might think, then, that synaesthesia would be more prevalent in bilingual children. But research suggests that people who learn a second language later than early childhood are more likely to have this sensory-switching ability than those who are natively bilingual. This bolsters the theory that synaesthesia develops as a learning tool.\nSynaesthesia emerges in childhood, as a child starts to take in the world around them, and they learn to talk, read and write. A 2016 study by researchers in Canada, the US and the Czech Republic found that children learn to categorise colours between ages of four and seven years, around the time they begin learning to read and write, and synaesthesia then begins to emerge from the age of six. The authors of the study surmise: \"Children use their newly-acquired ability to categorise colour as an unorthodox aid in mastering the domain of letters and words.\"\nHowever, synaesthesia can, on occasion, make communication more difficult \u2013 and the suggestion that synaesthesia might function as a strategy to facilitate learning \"remains a topic of debate\", says Lucie Bouvet, a psychologist at the University of Toulouse, France.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How synaesthesia inspires artists\n\u2022 The AI that 'tastes' colours\n\u2022\u00a0The adventure of raising bilingual children\n\"Phoneme-colour synaesthesia [is where] all phonemes \u2013 the smallest unit of spoken meaning \u2013 evoke the perception of specific colours,\" saysBouvet. This is the experience of a woman identified as 'VA' in a 2023 paper co-authored by Bouvet. For instance, every time VA hears a hard \"a\" sound, she sees luminous cyan. Every time she hears \"k\", she sees red.\n\"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. \"The colours evoked by phonemes help her to access meaning.\" VA's process of communication is to hear the sounds, then see the colours, then translate meaning from those colours.\nThis double translation effort could cause VA to lose track of conversations. \"In rare cases, individuals may find their synaesthesia overwhelming, feeling that their internal experiences interfere with their perception of the external world,\"\u00a0explains Bouvet.\nWhether helpful or not to the synaesthete, research into synaesthesia can help us to understand cognitive processes of language and perception. \"Synaesthesia is an intriguing phenomenon in itself,\" says Bouvet. \"But recent research suggests that it is part of a broader, specific cognitive profile. Identifying this unique cognitive profile may be key to gaining a deeper understanding of synaesthesia.\"\u00a0\nFor me, living life with a mishmash of sensations brings joy. Listening to music is a fully immersive experience. I sink into an ocean of texture, as if I'm under a soft duvet or submersed in cool water. The words of a book are not just inert ink on a page, but bring the story to life as they swirl around me. And language fills the air in a kaleidoscope of colour.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n--\nCorrection: This article originally stated that Dmitri Nabokov wrote Wednesday Is Indigo Blue.

        "article_text": "Authorities in one of the Philippines' most densely-populated urban centres are offering a cash reward for mosquitoes in an attempt to stop the spread of dengue.\nCarlito Cernal, village chief of Barangay Addition Hills in central Manila, announced the bounty of one peso (less than two US cents) for every five mosquitoes.\nWhile news of the bounty has provoked scorn on social media, Mr Cernal has defended it as necessary for the community's health.\nThe move follows a recent spike in cases of dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes, in the Philippines.\nThe programme, which will run for at least a month, was started after two students in Mr Cernal's neighbourhood died from the disease.\nThe bounty applies to all mosquitoes - dead or alive - and their larvae, Mr Cernal added. Live mosquitoes will be exterminated using ultraviolet light.\nA total of 21 people have already claimed their reward, bringing in a total of 700 mosquitoes and larvae so far,  he told the BBC.\nThe bounty drew swift ridicule after it was announced late on Tuesday. \n\"Mosquito farming is coming,\" one social media comment read. \"Will a mosquito get rejected if it has only one wing?\" read another.\nThe Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) told the BBC that it \"appreciates the good intentions of local government executives to fight dengue\".\nIt declined further comment, however, when asked if catching mosquitoes in exchange for cash is an effective way of stopping dengue.\n\"We urge all concerned to please consult and coordinate with their local health officers or the DOH regional office in their area for evidence-based practices that are known to work,\" it said.\nMr Cernal said he was aware that the bounty had been bashed on social media, but added: \"This is one of the biggest and most dense areas.

The rest had died shortly after the stranding.\nTasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years.\nFalse killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes. \nAuthorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress.\nLocal resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight.\n\"There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'.\"\n\"It's just absolutely horrific.\"\nThe site - about 300km from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media.\n\"This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,\" he said.\n\"We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else.\"\nRough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful.\n\"The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,\" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.\nWith conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the \"tough\" and \"confronting\" decision to euthanise the remaining whales.\n\"The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,\" Dr Carlyon said.\nThat grim task - which involves shooting the animals -  is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday.\nAuthorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested \"it may be a case of... letting nature run its course\".\nAuthorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access.\nMore than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast.\nAround 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022.\nWhales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication.\nThere are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disoriented after following fish they hunt to the shore.\nOthers believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.",

        "article_text": "Nigeria's former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a book about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country.\nA Journey In Service, which chronicles his life, especially while he was in office from 1985 to 1993, has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently.\nHere are four takeaways from the book:\nThis is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria's history. Some say the country still hasn't really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections.\nIn the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election.\nThe poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil. \nThe date of the vote \u2013 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day.\nGen Babangida was forced to resign.\nMoshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated.\nNigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place.\n\"That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,\" Babangida writes.\nGen Babangida, popularly known as IBB, acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, won the election.\nHowever, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis. \nAt the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country\u2019s judiciary as reasons for the annulment.\nAbiola\u2019s son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members.\n\u201dPerhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,\u201d he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.\nCivilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Sani Abacha.\nGeneral Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida's presidency.\n\"We were very close friends,\" Babangida recalls.\n\"We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close.\"\nHowever, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers. \n\"With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path.\"\nVatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness.\n\"I had to choose between saving a friend's life and the nation's future,\" he writes.\nAnother contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria's first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders.\nThe fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an \"Igbo coup\" - a label Babangida rejects.\nHe highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny.\nThe book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover.\nThe former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president.\nBabangida writes: \"It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters.\n\"For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only 'Igbo' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today's Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as 'Hausa' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country.\nThe association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war. \nMany Nigerians see Babangida's wife Maryam as the country's most iconic and influential First Lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried.\n\"She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled \u2013 and she often smiled \u2013 her face lit up, and her eyes danced,\" he writes.\n\"We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds.\"\n\"I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah's hands, not in humanity's. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow,\" Babangida says.\nHe describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language.\nMy mother's name is the colour of milk. The strings of an acoustic guitar, when strummed, play the warm yellow of honeycomb. The sound is flat, hard and smooth. And Monday is pink. These sensations are always the same, and always present. This is synaesthesia \u2013 in my case grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and sound-texture synaesthesia.\nLike many synaesthetes, I discovered at a young age I had a flair for both music and languages. In music, it wasn't the physical act of performing I excelled at, but composition. I went on to become a composer for short films and dance theatre, and a sound editor for television. Writing music felt a lot like a language to me, as I \"saw\" the colours of the sounds in a similar way.

Around\u00a060 different types of synaesthesia\u00a0have been identified, but there could be more than 100, with some types\u00a0experienced in clusters.\nThe condition is thought to be caused by genetically inherited traits that affect the structural and functional development of the brain. Increased communication between sensory regions in the brain means, for example, words can stimulate taste, sequences of numbers may be perceived in spatial arrangements, or the feel of textures\u00a0might conjure\u00a0emotions.\nSynaesthesia is not considered to be a neurological disorder and \u2013 although it has been linked to neurodevelopmental\u00a0and mental health conditions including autism, anxiety and schizophrenia \u2013 it is described as an \"alternative perceptual reality\" and generally thought to be beneficial.\n\"When I was younger\u00a0I knew I saw the world in a different way, and my way of describing that to others was 'colourful',\" says Smadar Frisch.\nFrisch, who has grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and lexical\u2013gustatory synaesthesia \u2013 where words have taste \u2013 explores the world of senses through her podcast, Chromatic Minds, and is currently writing her first book on the subject. \"Learning in school was too much for me sensory-wise,\" she says. \"It is very difficult trying to solve an equation\u00a0when all the colouring of a series of numbers was a psychedelic\u00a0blast.\"\nThis explosion of colour, says Frisch, would cause her to lose focus and forget what she was doing. \"[It was the] same with language. The words' colours, music and taste sensations ignited me and I wanted to express myself so much \u2013 that I lost focus.\"\nIt wasn't until she'd almost finished high school that she came across Richard Cytowic and David Eagleman's book, Wednesday is Indigo blue. \"My initial thought was that Wednesday is actually orange \u2013 and I needed to get this book.\" This was a turning point for Frisch.\u00a0\"I finally understood how my synaesthete brain is linked and wired. And I thought to myself, this phenomenon is amazing. I can use the colours to help me learn, rather than confuse me.\"\nFrisch developed a colour coding system to help her learn new languages\u00a0fluently and quickly. Studying languages no longer felt confusing but \"organised\", she says. \"And it worked! My whole world changed. I went on to learn the thing my brain was meant to excel in: languages.\"\nFrisch says she was able to learn French and Spanish fluently in just two months. \"I scored 90+ on each [French and Spanish] exam,\" she says. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently \u2013 and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\".\nJulia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. She and her team tested around 6,000 children who were six to 10 years old. \"We screened each one individually for synaesthesia, and then gave [them] a battery of tests to determine what skills come with synaesthesia,\" she says.\nThe study found that the children with synaesthesia were better in a number of skills than the children without \u2013 skills which, according to Simner, would \"certainly help both first and second language learning\".\n\"Specifically, they were significantly better in\u00a0receptive vocabulary (how many words they could understand), productive vocabulary (how many words they knew how to say), short term memory store, attention to detail and creativity,\" Simner says. \"These syn-linked skills predict that we might well expect second-language learning to be easier for someone with synaesthesia.\"\nHaving synaesthetic colours, she says, makes letters more memorable. And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"The way these colours seep across languages can either be via the way the letter looks or the way the letter sounds,\" says Simner. \"It's like the colour scaffolds across from one language to another.\"\nIn 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning \u2013 allowing a person to \"see\" patterns \u2013 an ability critical to language learning.\nThe researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words \u2013 for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" \u2013 representing\u00a0an artificial \"language\".\nThey then listened to a second set of words. This set included the original artificial words, plus new artificial words which represented a \"foreign\" language. The participants were then asked to distinguish \"words\" from each of the two artificial languages.\n\"It didn't have meaning,\" says Amy Finn, psychologist and director of the University of Toronto's cognitive neuroscience and developmental laboratory, Finn Land Lab. \"It was constructed to look at 'segmentation' \u2013 or how you use regularities to pull out what the segments of language\u00a0even are. This is a very early but super important problem in early language learning.\"\nThe results showed grapheme-colour synaesthetes were better able to differentiate between the two \"languages\" than participants who didn't have synaesthesia. \"We think [synaesthesia] can help you parse the chunks of language more easily,\" says Finn.\nWhen synaesthetes experience the same patterns with more than one sense \u2013 for example, both aurally\u00a0and\u00a0visually \u2013 their mind conjures a bonus secondary cue which can help them recognise or remember the pattern.\nTake 11-year-old me, put on the spot in my first week of secondary school. \"How do you say 'work'?\" demands my French teacher. The class is silent. I know the word is blue. Then it comes to me. \"Travail,\" I answer. Sometimes I can't remember a word \u2013 but I can remember the colour. This can be frustrating because no one can help me if I say \"it's pink\", as the colours are unique to my own mind. On the other hand, colour acts as an extra reminder, a bonus cue I can put to use when learning languages.\nYou might think, then, that synaesthesia would be more prevalent in bilingual children. But research suggests that people who learn a second language later than early childhood are more likely to have this sensory-switching ability than those who are natively bilingual. This bolsters the theory that synaesthesia develops as a learning tool.\nSynaesthesia emerges in childhood, as a child starts to take in the world around them, and they learn to talk, read and write. A 2016 study by researchers in Canada, the US and the Czech Republic found that children learn to categorise colours between ages of four and seven years, around the time they begin learning to read and write, and synaesthesia then begins to emerge from the age of six. The authors of the study surmise: \"Children use their newly-acquired ability to categorise colour as an unorthodox aid in mastering the domain of letters and words.\"\nHowever, synaesthesia can, on occasion, make communication more difficult \u2013 and the suggestion that synaesthesia might function as a strategy to facilitate learning \"remains a topic of debate\", says Lucie Bouvet, a psychologist at the University of Toulouse, France.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How synaesthesia inspires artists\n\u2022 The AI that 'tastes' colours\n\u2022\u00a0The adventure of raising bilingual children\n\"Phoneme-colour synaesthesia [is where] all phonemes \u2013 the smallest unit of spoken meaning \u2013 evoke the perception of specific colours,\" saysBouvet. This is the experience of a woman identified as 'VA' in a 2023 paper co-authored by Bouvet. For instance, every time VA hears a hard \"a\" sound, she sees luminous cyan. Every time she hears \"k\", she sees red.\n\"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. \"The colours evoked by phonemes help her to access meaning.\" VA's process of communication is to hear the sounds, then see the colours, then translate meaning from those colours.\nThis double translation effort could cause VA to lose track of conversations. \"In rare cases, individuals may find their synaesthesia overwhelming, feeling that their internal experiences interfere with their perception of the external world,\"\u00a0explains Bouvet.\nWhether helpful or not to the synaesthete, research into synaesthesia can help us to understand cognitive processes of language and perception. \"Synaesthesia is an intriguing phenomenon in itself,\" says Bouvet. \"But recent research suggests that it is part of a broader, specific cognitive profile. Identifying this unique cognitive profile may be key to gaining a deeper understanding of synaesthesia.\"\u00a0\nFor me, living life with a mishmash of sensations brings joy. Listening to music is a fully immersive experience. I sink into an ocean of texture, as if I'm under a soft duvet or submersed in cool water. The words of a book are not just inert ink on a page, but bring the story to life as they swirl around me. And language fills the air in a kaleidoscope of colour.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n--\nCorrection: This article originally stated that Dmitri Nabokov wrote Wednesday Is Indigo Blue.

In the west the vast majority has turned conservative black, especially in Bavaria where Merz's conservative sister party, the CSU, dominates the landscape.\nBut the AfD is spreading in the west too, and political loyalty to the old mainstream parties has gone. \nFor one in five Germans it has become normalised. \"They're just normal people,\" said one young man of immigrant origin in Duisburg, a city in western Germany's old industrial heartland.\nEven though it came second, the AfD is blocked from being part of the next government because of a \"firewall\" - or Brandmauer - operated by Germany's main parties, who do not co-operate with any party seen as extremist since the end of World War Two.\nThe AfD's leader Alice Weidel insists it is a libertarian, conservative movement, not racist. Its big increase in public support has coincided with a series of deadly attacks in the past nine months, all allegedly by immigrants.\nThe AfD has embraced a highly controversial policy called \"remigration\", which it defines as deporting migrants who have committed crimes. But the term can also refer to the mass deportation of migrants and their descendants.\nIn May 2024 a German court rejected an AfD appeal against a ruling classifying it as a suspected far-right extremist organisation. Judges found that the AfD had \"positions that disparage the democratic order and are incompatible with the principle of democracy\".\nIn three German states in the east - Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony - domestic intelligence has designated the AfD as right-wing extremist.\nA leading AfD figure in Thuringia, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, has twice been convicted of using a banned Nazi slogan \"Alles f\u00fcr Deutschland\" - everything for Germany. Alice Weidel supporters have chanted her name during the election campaign, using the phrase \"Alice f\u00fcr Deutschland\".\nNot since 1987 has turnout been as high as 82.5% in a German election, and that was three years before reunification of east and west.\nFour years ago it was 76.6%.\nPut simply, more than four in every five of Germany's 59.2 million voters turned out. \nIt reflects just how energised Germans have been by this election, which comes at a pivotal moment for their country. There were nine TV debates in the final stretch of the campaign, but that reflected the broad interest of the audience.\nThe three-party government of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz fell apart at the end of last year, and within 24 hours of Sunday's election, all three leaders have said they're leaving the front line of politics.\nThe leader of the economic liberals, the FDP, was first. Christian Lindner has led his party for 11 years. But it failed to get any MPs elected and Lindner has said he's leaving politics after 25 years. \nIt was Lindner's refusal to compromise on debt rules that first brought the government down, and then sent his party into the wilderness.\nAlthough Scholz will remain as chancellor until the next government is formed, he won't be taking part in coalition talks and will be leaving frontline politics.\nGreens Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck is also leaving frontline politics after his party fell below 12% in the election.\nUntil a few weeks ago, the Left party looked doomed when one of its leading lights, Sahra Wagenknecht, went off and founded her own, more populist, party with eight other MPs.\nWagenknecht's popularity soared for a while as head of her BSW party, but ultimately fell just below the 5% threshold for getting into parliament.  \nThe story was very different for the Left (Die Linke), which came back from the dead with an inspired social medial campaign.\nHeidi Reichinnek, Die Linke's co-chair, went viral after she gave a speech enthusiastically defending the firewall against the AfD. \nShe now has 580,000 followers on TikTok and her post has attracted seven million views.\nHer party secured just under 9% of the vote.\nDie Linke's viral videos helped secure a quarter of the 18-24 vote, and the AfD were not far behind with 21%, according to surveys by ARD TV.\nAlice Weidel was the biggest hit on social media during the election, even bigger than Heidi Reichinnek. She has attracted more than 935,000 followers on TikTok.\nFor the over-35s, it was the Christian Democrats who won out, and more men than women.",

        "article_text": "We use them to clean the dishes we eat off, but your kitchen sponge is a damp, crumb-filled environment that is perfect for bacteria to thrive in. Should you opt for a washing up brush instead?\nMany species of bacteria know how to rough it out. Some thrive deep within the Earth's crust, or inside boiling hydrothermal vents, and others even call frozen tundra their home. Ask most bacteria where they'd really like to live though, and a kitchen sponge would probably top the list.\u00a0\nYes, it turns out that the very tool we use to clean our plates and glasses is packed full of microbial life. Sponges are bacterial heaven. They're warm, damp, and full of nutritious food crumbs for the microbes to feast on.\u00a0\nIn 2017, Markus Egert, a microbiologist at Furtwangen University in Germany, published new data on the bacterial microbiome of used kitchen sponges. He discovered a whopping 362 species of microbes in those sponges. In some places, the density of bacteria reached up to 54 billion individuals per square centimetre.\u00a0\n\"This is a very big amount, it's similar to the number of bacteria that you would find in a human stool sample,\" says Egert.\u00a0\nSponges are full of holes and pockets \u2013 each providing a niche for a community of microbes to settle down in.\nLingchong You, a synthetic biologist at Duke University, and his team, used computers to model the complex environment of a sponge for a 2022 study. He found that sponges with pockets of varying sizes encouraged the most microbial growth. His team then replicated these results by growing different strains of E.coli in cellulose sponges.\u00a0\n\"They found out that having a variety of different pore sizes in kitchen sponges is something that really matters [for encouraging bacterial growth],\" says Egert. \"This makes sense because, for microbes, you have individualists [such as] bacteria that like to grow on their own, and you have bacteria that need the company of others. Inside a sponge you have so many different structures or niches that everyone gets happy.\"\nSponges definitely make good homes for bacteria. However, it does not necessarily follow that these utensils are also a health risk to us. Bacteria exist everywhere \u2013 on our skin, in the soil, and in the air around us. Not all are harmful, in fact many perform vital jobs. The important question is, therefore, are the bacteria found in sponges even worth worrying about?\nIn Egert's 2017 study, he sequenced the DNA of the most common species. Although it was not possible to identify the exact species of each bacterium, five out of ten of the most prevalent species were closely related to bacteria known to cause infections in people with compromised immune systems. Special cleaning measures such as heating in a microwave or rinsing with hot, soapy water didn't really help either, as although it eliminated some bacteria, it allowed other, more resistant strains, to thrive.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Our hypothesis is that cleaning measures might lead to a kind of selection process, where the few survivors can grow up to large numbers again,\" says Egert. \"If you do this a couple of times, then this might lead to a selection of bacteria that are better adapted to cleaning.\"\nIt's important to note that none of the bacteria found by Egert are linked to food poisoning or severe sickness. In fact, 90% of hospitalisations from food-borne illnesses can be traced to just five pathogens, three of which are bacteria \u2013 Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Campylobacter. Thankfully, these are quite rare in sponges.\u00a0\n\"We only found potentially pathogenic bacteria, so bacteria that can be dangerous to people with weak immune systems, or the elderly or children,\" says Egert. \"Usually, for a healthy person, the bacteria inside the kitchen sponge are not harmful.\"\u00a0\nIn 2017, Jennifer Quinlan, a professor of food safety at Prairie View A&M University in the US, and her colleagues, collected kitchen sponges from 100 homes in Philadelphia. She found that only 1-2% of those sponges contained bacteria linked to food poisoning in humans. The ones that did contained only small amounts of harmful bacteria.\u00a0\nThis finding was backed up by a 2022 study in which Solveig Langsrud, a scientist at the Norwegian food research institute Nofima, compared the bacteria found in washing up sponges and brushes. She found a common set of harmless non-pathogenic bacteria in both kinds of utensil, including\u00a0Acinetobacter, Chryseobacterium, Enhydrobacter,\u00a0Enterobacteriaceae\u00a0and\u00a0Pseudomonas. However, brushes contained much less bacteria overall.\n\"The vast majority of bacteria on sponges do not cause illness, they're just going to make it smell. They're going to make it unpleasant over time,\" says Quinlan. \"Having said that, there is a possibility that if you use a sponge to wipe up raw meat or raw chicken juice that you could have some of those pathogenic bacteria on there, and studies have found that pathogens can be isolated from kitchen sponges.\"\nSo, while the bacteria growing in your sponge are not usually harmful, if dangerous bacteria such as Salmonella arrive on the scene, the sponge's structure makes it an ideal place for this pathogen to grow.\nThere's evidence this is the case. In Langsrud's study, when the researchers introduced Salmonella to kitchen sponges, they thrived, but when they added this bacteria to brushes, they died. That could be because brushes will often dry out more effectively between uses, killing the Salmonella bacteria, while sponges can still remain damp inside if they are used daily.\nThese potentially pathogenic bacteria can then also be transferred from your sponge to the plates and utensils or surfaces.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The rise of the 'no-wash' movement\n\u2022\u00a0Why vinegar is so good at cleaning\n\u2022\u00a0How often should you wash your towels\nSo, how often should we change our kitchen sponge? Quinlan argues that from a hygiene perspective, ideally you should replace it on a weekly basis, but there are things you can do to prolong its service.\n\"There's two easy ways of cleaning them. You can put them in the dishwasher at the end of the evening, or you can microwave them for a minute until you can see steam coming off. That will kill the majority of the pathogens.\"\nCertainly, studies have shown that putting your sponge through the dishwasher or the microwave can reduce the bacterial load and can be more effective than soaking your sponge in bleach. But as Egbert's study demonstrated, this can then select for more resistant strains and so cleaning will become less effective over time.\nPutting a sponge in boiling water and disinfectant will also kill most bacteria, although some may survive, especially those that form protective gooey biofilms. But this approach has been found to be effective at reducing potential pathogens such as Salmonella.\nOther tips include not storing the sponge in the sink, so that it is allowed to dry in between uses, and really squeezing out the moisture and getting rid of food crumbs. However, some may consider using a different tool entirely in order to clean dishes.\n\"I wouldn't use kitchen sponges at all. It actually does not make sense to me to use such an item inside the kitchen environment,\" says Egert. \"A brush is much better because it contains less bacteria and it dries out more easily. It's also easier to clean.\"\n--\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

We have to play so well, especially after the result we took away in the first leg.\"\nOpta statistics rate City's chances of advancing at a more optimistic 19.8%, but those percentages must be viewed through the prism of Real's history in this tournament and the muscle memory that kicks in for the 15-time winners when it matters.\nGuardiola's record with City against Real is chequered, though it started with victory in the last 16 in 2020, the two legs being played six months apart because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe most bitter moment came two years later when City led by two goals on aggregate in the 90th minute of the semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu, only for Rodrygo to score twice within seconds, Karim Benzema's injury-time penalty sending Real on to eventual victory over Liverpool in the final in Paris.\nWhen Guardiola, as Manchester City manager, claimed his third Champions League crown in 2023, after winning with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Real were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the Spanish champions then prevailing on penalties last season.\nHe said: \"I have some incredible memories here - sometimes good ones, sometimes not so good. \n\"We know at this stage, and in this stadium, the pressure is there - but you get that in Milan, in Barcelona, at Anfield. You have to suffer at these places, but you have to reduce those moments.\"\nReal's remarkable win against City in 2022 is the sort of sporting lightning strike Guardiola will seek to turn back on them, but he must do it with a fading team that has lost its domestic supremacy after winning a historic four successive Premier Leagues, and now faces the prospect of going out of the Champions League before the last 16 for the first time in 12 years.\nCarlo Ancelotti (left) and Pep Guardiola will be meeting in the Champions League for the 10th time\nThe wily Ancelotti was not taking Guardiola's bait about percentages when he spoke in Madrid on Tuesday, saying: \"He doesn't really think that. We don't think we have a 99% chance. We have a small advantage - and we have to take advantage of that.\"\nGuardiola responded: \"For the first time he didn't believe me. I always say what I think, and this time you don't believe me.\"\nStatistics pile up like giant obstacles in front of City's route to the last 16, explaining why Real are overwhelming favourites after two goals in a late surge gave them victory at Etihad Stadium.\nIt was the 40th time Real have won the first leg of a European knockout-stage tie away from home, progressing on 37 of the previous 39 occasions.\nCity's defeat, meanwhile, was the fifth time they have lost the first leg of a Champions League knockout-stage tie, going on to be eliminated on the previous four occasions.\nFor Ancelotti, this tournament's greatest coach with five wins, he will be meeting Guardiola in the Champions League for the 10th time, on eight occasions with Real against City. The Italian has won four of their nine meetings, never losing at home, winning two games and drawing two.\nOf more recent significance is that to unseat the holders, City will have to alter poor form in the competition after losing their past three away games to Sporting, Juventus and Paris St-Germain.\nGuardiola's spirits will be lifted by Saturday's 4-0 win over Newcastle United which included a hat-trick inside 14 first-half minutes for new Egyptian signing Omar Marmoush, while Erling Haaland demonstrated his quality with both goals in the first-leg defeat, his first against Real Madrid.\nHaaland has been prolific in the Champions League, scoring 49 goals in 48 games. If he scores at the Bernabeu, he will become the fastest player to 50 goals in appearances and age, at 24 years and 213 days.\nIt could even be a Champions League farewell to Manchester City for modern greats of the club such as Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and goalkeeper Ederson, while others such as Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic are also in their 30s.\nGuardiola would not be drawn as he said: \"I would like to answer this but it will be at the end of the season. We still have a lot to play for, to qualify for the Champions League next season, we are still there in the Champions League this season. We have the FA Cup and the Club World Cup.\"\nSilva added: \"If you had told me at the start of the season that we would be in this position in the Champions League and the Premier League I wouldn't have believed you. We deserve to be in this complicated situation because of where we finished.\n\"We have to believe. We still believe things can go our way, but this season is certainly a lesson for the future.\"\nFor Manchester City, that future is now - in the forbidding, unforgiving surroundings of the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nAnd if Guardiola can overcome those \"1%\" odds in this footballing cathedral, it will rank alongside the best results of his career.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The R&B singer Roberta Flack, best known for the hits The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and Killing Me Softly With His Song, has died at the age of 88.\n\"We are heartbroken that the glorious Roberta Flack passed away this morning, February 24, 2025,\" said a statement from her representatives. \n\"She died peacefully surrounded by her family. Roberta broke boundaries and records. She was also a proud educator.\"\nFlack had previously announced in 2022 that she had motor neurone disease, and could no longer sing.\nBorn in North Carolina and raised in Arlington, Virginia, the musician started out as a classical pianist. She gained a full school scholarship to Howard University aged just 15. Her classical training led her into teaching, but at night she'd accompany opera singers on piano, singing pop standards during the breaks.\n\"The whole while I was studying classical music, especially in my younger years, I was also doing a lot of doo-ron-ron, shoo-doo-bee-doo, all of that stuff, with my peers, so I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by music all of my life, the Bach and the Chopin and the Schumann on one hand, and all the rhythm and blues,\" she explained.\nHer recording career started after she was discovered singing in a jazz club by musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known\".\nBut she didn't score her first hit until she was in her 30s - when her recording of Ewan MacColl's The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face was used to soundtrack an explicit love scene in Clint Eastwood's 1971 film Play Misty For Me.\nIt was subsequently named song of the year at the Grammys. Flack won the award a second time the following year, for Killing Me Softly With His Song.\nAfter topping the charts again in 1974 with Feel Like Makin' Love, Flack took a break from performing to concentrate on recording and charitable causes.\nShe spent much of the 1980s touring and over the course of her career, worked with artists including Donny Hathaway and Miles Davis.\nIn 1991 she returned to the charts with a duet with Maxi Priest called Set the Night to Music (from the album of the same name).\n She also recorded an album of Beatles covers, called Let It Be Roberta, in 2012.\nAccording to the Guardian, Flack once told a journalist: \"What I consider myself is a soulful singer, in that I try to sing with all the feeling that I have in my body and my mind.\n\"A person with true soul is one who can take anybody's song and transcend all the flaws, the technique and just make you listen.\"\nOnce married, to US jazz musician Stephen Novosel, the star devoted a lot of her time to the Roberta Flack School of Music in New York.\nReverend Jesse Jackson once described her as \"socially relevant and politically unafraid\".\nIn 2020, a year after having a stroke, Flack was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Grammys.\n\"It's a tremendous and overwhelming honour,\" she said at the time. \n\"I've tried my entire career to tell stories through my music. This award is a validation to me that my peers heard my thoughts and took in what I have tried to give.\"\n\nFlack's most famous song was introduced to a new generation of music fans when Lauryn Hill's hip-hop group The Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of Killing Me Softly, which they would eventually perform on-stage alongside her.\nIt topped the charts around the world in 1996.",

        "article_text": "There's a pervasive belief in the Netherlands that this unconventional meal helps lift the national mood.\n\"I think I'm an addict, basically,\" says Marije Nicklin, who grew up on the Dutch island of Terschelling. The Dutch expat, who has been based in West Yorkshire, UK, since 2002, is obsessed with hagelslag, carefully rationing the packets her parents post to her and the bag-loads she brings back on the ferry. \"I've got quite a lot in storage,\" she says. \"I do start to twitch when I see the end is coming.\"\nTranslated as \"hailstorm\", hagelslag are crispy, oblong-shaped sugar strands, just a few millimetres long. They are most commonly chocolate-flavoured and coated in a shiny glaze. In a supermarket in any other country, you'd likely see them in the cake toppings section reserved for a special occasion, but in the Netherlands, where more than 14 million kilograms of hagelslag are consumed per year, many people eat them every week, sprinkling them liberally onto buttered bread as a quick breakfast, snack or lunch. The hagelslag sandwich (broodje hagelslag) is surely an anachronism in this age of sugar awareness, but there's a pervasive belief in the Netherlands that this unconventional meal helps lift the national mood.\nGood hagelslag is crunchy on impact but then melts in the mouth. Each season sees new variations appear in the shops: little bunnies for Easter, for example, or orange hagelslag for Koningsdag, an annual orange-themed street party to celebrate the King's birthday. The small packs seen in many hotel breakfast buffets are ideal for novices, and a few years back, one supermarket even experimented with pick 'n' mix. Whichever variety you choose, the habit is widespread, with an estimated 750,000 hagelslag sandwiches consumed each day.\nStrictly speaking, hagelslag is a sugar-based vermicelli sprinkle that is chocolate or fruit-flavoured, but the name has become associated with other cheerfully packaged sugary toppings found on the same supermarket shelf, such as curly vlokken (chocolate flakes) and muisjes, sugar-coated aniseed seeds that look like tiny mice and are typically served on beschuit (rusks). In the 17th Century, aniseed was thought to aid lactation and help the womb contract, and pink or blue\u00a0muisjes on beschuit\u00a0are still served today to celebrate the arrival of a baby.\nFor Nicklin, whose favourite variety is the puur (dark chocolate), the crunchiness is very important. \"It's the bite with hagelslag. I don't think you can get that with any other spread,\" she says. \"It still makes me feel happy.\" She bats back any suggestion that this sweet sandwich is messy to eat, explaining that her family use high-sided plates to catch any stray strands, which she insists are returned empty. \"It's a crime to leave any on the plate,\" she says.\nThe first sugary toppings, in the form of aniseed muisjes, are thought to date to the late 19th Century when Cornelius Rutgerus de Ruijter sold them from his bakery in Baarn in the province of Utrecht. The brand, now known as market leader De Ruijter, expanded their production to factory-made fruit hagelslag in 1928 and chocolate hagelslag and flokken in the 1950s.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nEven Dutch royalty loved the sugary treat. King Willem III made the brand a purveyor of the court in 1883. And in 1985, under Queen Beatrix, De Ruijter received the Koninklijk (royal) predicate, an honour, a spokesperson from parent company Kraft-Heinz told BBC Travel, which \"can only be carried by Dutch companies who have been officially recognised for their important position within their discipline, are at least 100 years old and are considered of national importance\". Quite a fanfare for a modest chocolate sprinkle.\u00a0\nOn an industrial estate in Tilburg \u2013 a short distance from the border with Belgium, wheresprinkles are commonly called muizenstrontjes (mouse droppings) \u2212 an immense but unremarkable building houses the world's largest hagelslag factory. Photographer Jordy Leenders from Eindhoven is one of the lucky few who has seen inside. Commissioned in 2018 to take photographs of its inner workings, he said he felt, \"like I was Charlie, being invited to the chocolate factory for a tour\".\nHaving gone through a machine that rid him of dust and disinfected his hands and arms, Leenders, kitted out in ear defenders and factory scrubs, emerged into a space filled by what he describes as a kind of \"indoor rollercoaster\u2026 crisscrossing the room\" made up of \"mazes\" of vast conveyor belts moving the hagelslag through different stages of preparation to perfect their size, texture and shape.\n\"Though the smell of chocolate is strong in the early stages when you're working with a raw material, it's the noise that really hits you,\" he says, describing the sound of the hagelslag being emptied from the silos \"like pouring 2,000kg of rice into a bucket\".\nHe notes that one of the most memorable sights was the extrusion process, which creates \"a very long string of hagelslag that they break off and cut\" before spraying it with a fine mist of sugar to give it its appealing gloss. Leenders was astounded by the \"absurd scale\" of the factory and the complex processes required \"in order to deliver a decoration to put on your sandwich\". \"When you have it in your hands, you're thinking that it is pretty simple,\" he says.\nFor newcomers to the Netherlands, it's the foodstuff itself that can be baffling. Colleen Geske, who moved to Amsterdam from Canada in 2005, has a clear memory of the first time she encountered hagelslag. Her first employer in the Netherlands shared a cafeteria with various tech, finance and law firms. \"Every lunch hour, I would see these tables of men in suits that were eating what I could only describe as the lunch of a four-year-old,\" recalls the author of Stuff Dutch People Eat and co-host of the Stuff Dutch People Like podcast. \"They were all with cartons of milk and having their bread with hagelslag. To me, it was such a bizarre sight.\"\n\"Hagelslag tells us a lot about the Dutch,\" Geske adds. \"When you strip it away, the Dutch are not pretentious at all. They don't care what people think of them often\u2026 They're not over-analysing this, thinking: Is this healthy? Is this for children? They're just indulging in a relatively simple pleasure.\"\nHagelslag occupies a special place in a cuisine, which is in general, \"quite practical, quite basic\", she adds. \"Hagelslag is the one kind of sparkly, shiny, interesting, funny, kind of quirky thing about a Dutch meal.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\nBut the tradition of eating this illogical little lunch is not all about the taste, she notes. \"I think, personally, that it's also this feeling of nostalgia that the Dutch have around eating hagelslag. It's like that one thing that you grew up with as a kid that you're still 'allowed' to do as an adult.\" Due to its high sugar content, her own children are only allowed it at weekends. They're very specific about how it must be made, telling Geske: \"No, you need more butter and you have to put way more hagelslag on, and it has to be evenly distributed to the very edges...\"\nLeenders admits that the Dutch are eating \"basically a crushed chocolate bar on their sandwich\", which, he says, \"doesn't really make sense if you're looking at it from a nutritional perspective\". But that has never put him off. \"I've been raised in the Netherlands so I'm a frequent hagelslag eater,\" he says. \"I don't think you will encounter any Dutch household without at least one pack of hagelslagin their kitchen cabinets.\"\nAs far as Leenders is concerned, there's nothing childish about hagelslag. \"It's for all ages,\" he insists. \"I know people over 60 who still start their day with a sandwich with hagelslag on top of it.\"\n\"I struggle to get it in my head why they think it's for children,\" agrees Nicklin. \"My dad always had hagelslag on his bread. And she can't think why anyone would think a hagelslag sandwich makes no sense: \"If that's what they believe, then they're obviously not Dutch.\"\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

The plan faced multiple delays - mainly due to environmental concerns and political disputes - before the government cleared it in 2021. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for its construction in December last year. \nThe project is supposed to help the drought-prone Bundelkhand region - which includes parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh - where arid climate and unpredictable rainfall patterns have led to decades of poverty and underdevelopment. \nThe government says that once completed in 2030, it will help irrigate 1.06 million hectares of land, provide drinking water to 6.2 million people and generate 130MW of hydropower and solar energy.\nBut at least 10 villages, including vast swathes of precious forest land, will be submerged to build the dam's reservoir and 11 more villages will be displaced for constructing the canal, affecting more than 7,000 families, district officials say. \n\"Our livelihoods are tied to this land - we don't know what the future holds for us anymore,\" said Tulsi Adivasi, who is among the thousands of villagers protesting against the project. \nMost of them belong to the indigenous Gond and Kol tribes, who live along the edge of forests and depend on farming for a living.\nEnvironmental experts warn the project will submerge nearly 98 sq km (38 sq miles) of the Panna Tiger Reserve, a 543 sq km sanctuary that successfully brought tigers back from local extinction in 2009.  \nThis could undo years of conservation efforts. \"It's unprecedented. We have never seen a core area of a national park being used for such a large-scale infrastructure project before,\" says environmentalist Amit Bhatnagar. \nIn 2019, a panel of experts constituted by India's top court had also raised concerns about the project, questioning its economic viability and impact on the region's wildlife. The government, it said, should explore alternative irrigation methods in the river basin. \nIndependent studies on river-linking projects in India have made similar observations. \nA 2023 study published in the Nature Communications journal states that such endeavours \"may worsen the water stress across the country, making these projects ineffective or possibly even counterproductive\". \nBaleshwar Thakur, who heads the National Water Development Agency, however, defended the project, saying authorities had conducted a thorough research and acquired all environmental clearances for the project.\n\"We have also designated additional land to offset the loss of tiger habitats and will rehabilitate other species affected by the project as well,\" he said. \nThe government official admitted that there would be a potential \"challenge\" to the biodiversity of the region, but said that \"the benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts\". \nThe assurances have done little to comfort the villagers. \nIn the heart of Daudhan, 48-year-old Mahesh Adivasi sat with a group of men, who voiced their dissent in the form of a protest song.\n\"Ken-Betwa dam is built by the government, it gives others water but drowns us,\" they sang, the lyrics capturing their anguish. \nThe village is one of the poorest areas in the region, lacking basic facilities such as clean drinking water and electricity. \nThe bitter irony of the river project isn't lost on its people - they ask why they are being asked to abandon their homes to provide electricity in 13 other districts when their own village has never had power.\n\"We have seen generations pass without progress. Now, we are being asked to sacrifice our lives for others' progress. What about us?\" Mahesh Adivasi said. \nThe government has offered villagers an optional compensation plan, where they can either opt for a piece of land along with 750,000 rupees ($8,655; \u00a36,842) or a one-time payout of 1,250,000 rupees. For those who own land, an additional amount based on the land's value will also be given.\nMr Thakur said that about 90% of the people had chosen to take the lump sum amount. \"In the meantime, the government has started looking for alternative government land to resettle the villagers,\" he added. \nBut locals say the amount being offered is insufficient. Tulsi Adivasi showed BBC Hindi a government notice which evaluated his house at 46,000 rupees.\n\"Can a house be built with this much money?\" he asked. \nOthers complain they have not been informed when they must evacuate or where they'd be resettled, fuelling anxieties about their future. \n\"The project should have been a blessing for our village but, the truth is, it will plunge us further into darkness,\"  said Lakshmi Adivasi, 20. \nQuestions have also been raised against the claim that the project is meant to channel excess water from the Ken river. \nCritics point out that the government has relied on outdated data from 2003, without independent verification, to calculate the river's annual yield. \nMr Thakur denied the allegation and said authorities \"have all the data to continue with the project\". \nMr Bhatnagar, the environmentalist, said that by going ahead with the project, the government was setting \"a dangerous precedent\" for similar development programmes to be carried out in other geologically sensitive areas. \n\"And for those affected, it once again underscores how development in India often comes at the cost of the most marginalised,\" he added. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

So, having a European passport, I sort of flew up on his radar. \n\"They offered me a chance to go there and finish my rehab and then playing a couple of months into the season.

To go to one of the top leagues in England from Division 2 in France was a huge jump, but it was one I was really excited for.\"\nThoughts of international football were still far off.\n\"I had really low expectations for myself and just wanted to settle in,\" she admitted.

        "article_text": "YouTube is about to turn 20. An unusual research method is unveiling statistics about the platform that Google would rather keep hidden.\nYouTube may not seem secretive. It's public facing. You can watch an endless stream of content from now until your dying breath. There's been a mountain of research about the platform, unpacking everything from the commodified economy that surrounds it to the radicalising effects of its algorithm. But the picture goes blurry when you start asking simple questions. For example: how much YouTube do we all watch?\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, is quiet about that and many other details. In February, the company revealed that people who access YouTube on their TVs collectively watch one billion hours a day, but total numbers for the platform are an enigma. Estimates say YouTube has around 2.5 billion monthly users \u2013 almost one in three people on Earth \u2013 and the average mobile app user watches something like 29 hours a month. With that, let's try some back-of-the-napkin maths.\nIf we make a few assumptions, and say that monthly viewing average for app users can be applied across all YouTube users on both the website and television, we can multiply 2.5 billion by 29 hours. This would tell us that humanity consumes something like 8.3 million years of videos on YouTube every month. Over 12 months, that adds up to almost 100 million years, hundreds of times longer than the sum total of human history.\nHow many YouTube videos are there? What are they about? What languages do YouTubers speak? As of 14 February 2025, the platform's will have been running for 20 years. That is a lot of video. Yet we have no idea just how many there really are. Google knows the answers. It just won't tell you.\nExperts say that's a problem. For all practical purposes, one of the most powerful communication systems ever created \u2013 a tool that provides a third of the world's population with information and ideas \u2013 is operating in the dark.\nIn part that's because there's no easy way to get a random sampling of videos, according to Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in the US. You can pick your videos manually or go with the algorithm's recommendations, but an unbiased selection that's worthy of real study is hard to come by. A few years ago, however, Zuckerman and his team of researchers came up with a solution: they designed a computer program that pulls up YouTube videos at random, trying billions of URLs at a time.\nYou might call the tool a bot, but that's probably over selling it, Zuckerman says. \"A more technically accurate term would be 'scraper',\" he says. The scraper's findings are giving us a first-time perspective on what's actually happening on YouTube.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn its 20 years of operation, YouTube has shaped entire generations' sensibilities and redefined global culture. Surveys show YouTube is the most popular social media site in the US by far, with 83% of adults and 93% of teenagers among its patrons. It's the second-most-visited website on Earth by most estimates, topped only by Google.com itself. But as the platform enters its third decade, the most basic facts about YouTube are still a closely guarded secret.\nA Google spokesperson shared a blogpost about the platform's recommendation algorithm, but declined to comment on the statistics and other issues mentioned in this story. For now, YouTube's mysteries continue.\n\"It's extremely difficult to get a grasp on what's going on inside social media platforms, because while the companies that operate them do make certain public disclosures, those disclosures are fragmentary and often somewhat misleading,\" says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"I think there's an instinct at Google that it's not in their interest to emphasise just how gargantuan YouTube is, how titanic the number of users, how phenomenal the amount of content. Google doesn't want to be seen as influential as it really is.\"\nBut Zuckerman and his colleagues found a way to peek behind the curtain. YouTube URL's have a standard format. With a few exceptions, the addresses begin with \"youtube.com/watch?v=\" and end with a unique string of 11 characters. Gangnam Style's identifier is 9bZkp7q19f0, for example.\nSo, the researchers wrote a program that basically generates 11 random characters and checks if there's a corresponding video. When the scraper finds one, it downloads it. Zuckerman says you can think of it like a pesky teenager, punching in random numbers for prank calls after dipping into his parent's liquor cabinet.\n\"If I wanted to know how many valid phone numbers there are in New York's 212 area code, I could just dial 212 and seven random numbers to see if somebody answers. I'd probably get cursed out a lot if I did it enough, but eventually I'd gather enough data to figure it out,\" Zuckerman says. \"That's what we did with YouTube. The thing is, YouTube has 18.6 quintillion potential numbers, so you have to dial a few billion before someone picks up.\"\nSo, Zuckerman's lab let the scraper drunk dial YouTube, over and over again, until it put together a big enough data set. To collect the first 10,016 videos they gathered for their initial study, the scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs. It took almost 1.87 billion bad guesses for every real video it found. If you did that work yourself, spending three seconds on each try, it would take an average of 178 years before you landed on a single video.\nWhen the researchers analysed their findings, the results challenged the prevailing narrative about what YouTube actually is.\nThe first question was simple. How many videos have people uploaded to YouTube? Google used to release that statistic in the early days, back when YouTube had something to prove. When Google first acquired the platform in 2006, around 65,000 videos were uploaded every day. More recently the company says more than 500 hours are uploaded per minute, but it's tight-lipped about the number of videos.\nZuckerman and his colleagues compared the number of videos they found to the number of guesses it took, and arrived an estimate: in 2022, they calculated that YouTube housed more than nine billion videos. By mid 2024, that number had grown to 14.8 billion videos, a 60% jump.\nFor many, YouTube brings to mind the faces of bright-eyed influencers vying for money and fame, or professional content creators like MrBeast or Joe Rogan. But the researchers then took a subset of the videos and had human reviewers watch each one to answer a series of questions about what they saw. For the most part, they didn't find the work of professionals.\nOnly 0.21% of the videos they analysed featured any kind of monetisation, such as a sponsorship or an advertisement in the video itself. Less than 4% of the videos included a call to action like YouTube's famous invitations to like, comment and subscribe.\nThose with some kind of set or background design accounted for 14% of videos, while only 38% had undergone any form of editing. More than half of the videos had \"noticeably shaky\" camera work. Only around 18% of videos we're judged to have high quality sound, and the sound quality varied significantly almost 85% of the time. More than 40% had just music, and no speech. About 16% of videos in the sample were primarily still images.\nThe top YouTubers attract audiences in the hundreds of millions, but the researchers estimated the median number of views for a YouTube videos is just 41, and 4% of videos haven't been watched a single time. About 74% of videos have zero comments. Around 89% have no likes. Typical YouTube videos aren't just getting little attention it seems, they're also very short. They assessed that the median YouTube video is only 64 seconds long, and more than a third of videos are less than 33 seconds long.\nYouTube once sold itself as a tool for regular people. The company's early slogan was \"broadcast yourself\". But today, YouTube suggests it's more of a service for people to watch the work of professional creators. In his annual letter at the start of 2025, YouTube's chief executive Neal Mohan said the company's mission is still to \"give everyone a voice\" \u2013 but most of the message was a discussion about how \"YouTubers are becoming the start-ups of Hollywood\" and \"YouTube is the new television\".\nThis narrative misses a critical piece of the picture, says Ryan McGrady, the senior researcher in Zuckerman's lab, who participated in the scraping project. YouTube is a free service that was built from the ground up by a private company, and it could be argued that Google should be able to run the platform as such. But when you examine how people are actually using YouTube, it looks less like TV and more like infrastructure, McGrady says.\n(To identify languages, the researchers used speech recognition software called Whisper. It paints a fairly accurate picture, but makes occasional errors. For example, Whisper sometimes identifies\u00a0unintelligible sounds as Nynorsk, a written-only language in Norway.)\n\"Most of us imagine YouTube as this place where millionaires give away prizes in a Squid-Game-style contest,\" he says. \"But when you want to have a conversation about YouTube and its place in our society, we need to look at the ways it's used, not just the ways it's consumed.\"\nYouTube is one of the internet's de facto repositories, the first place many of us go when we have videos we want to post or store online. It's also a place where local authority meetings are broadcast, for example, providing a vital opportunity for public accountability in ways that weren't possible before it existed. It isn't just a \"platform\", McGrady says, it's a critical piece of infrastructure, and that's how it should be regulated. \"For companies that own so much of our public sphere, there are some minimum expectations we should have about transparency.\"\nGoogle is dealing with more regulatory pressure than ever before. The company has faced multiple cases across the globe accusing it of running illegal monopolies in several industries. Google has lost several of them, and is currently fighting a number of other antitrust lawsuits.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The ghosts of India's TikTok\n\u2022\u00a0Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n\u2022\u00a0The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\nBut YouTube has escaped much of the scrutiny that's challenged its biggest social media competitors, according to Barrett of New York University. Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk make frequent, loud pronouncements about how they do business and what's happening on their platforms. \"Google, in contrast, has largely stayed out of the crossfire by choosing a strategy of being much quieter, a strategy I'd say has largely worked for them,\" he says.\n\"Social media is an anomaly when it comes to how little companies need to explain themselves if you compare it to other industries like finance, or agriculture or even broadcasting,\" Barrett says. \"But social media companies are fundamental players not just in mass communication but in all matters of political and civic life.\"\nThe most important thing to understand is the inner workings of YouTube's algorithm, a system that has astronomical power over the distribution of information all over the world, Barrett says. But simple details about what happens on the platform are important as well. \"It would be very valuable to know all of the facts that are currently so shrouded and unavailable. They are the building blocks of doing deeper research,\" he says. \"It only takes you so far, but you've got to start someplace. The more basic information we have to assess, the healthier the public debate about the role of social media in society will be.\"\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nHamilton makes first global appearance as a Ferrari driver\nLewis Hamilton made his first global appearance as a Ferrari driver as Formula 1 launched its 2025 season with a glitzy, ground-breaking show at London's O2 Arena.\nHamilton, whose first laps in a Ferrari were watched at the team's test track by a few hundred fans in Italy last month, was the star attraction during the two-hour show on Tuesday, and received the biggest cheers.\nBut many of the drivers drew huge reactions from the 15,000 crowd at the event, tickets for which sold out in 20 minutes last year.\n\"Good evening everyone,\" Hamilton said as the crowd celebrated him and their first sight of the seven-time champion in Ferrari's red overalls.\n\"Such a great night to be here among all of you. The word I am thinking about is 'invigorated'. I feel so full of life, because everything is new. Just focused on what's ahead. I am so excited to be part of the team.\"\nF1 75 launch event in pictures\nRussell has 'no intention' of speaking to Verstappen\nDriving test week 'hell' for F1 rookie Antonelli\nHost Jack Whitehall, meanwhile, joked about what it must have felt like for Mercedes to see their former champion walking out for their rivals.\nHamilton became the most successful driver in F1 history racing for the Silver Arrows. Now, he is turning out for the biggest, most celebrated, most historic name in the sport, in a partnership that has created a huge buzz already, with the season still just under a month away.\n\"It's everyone's worst nightmare,\" Whitehall said. \"Your partner of 10 years running off with an Italian stallion.\"\nHamilton, team-mate Charles Leclerc and Ferrari team boss Frederic Vasseur flew back to Italy straight after the show, to prepare for the official launch of Ferrari's 2025 car in Maranello on Wednesday. As with the other teams, the car on stage was a show car in this year's paint job, not the machine that will contest this championship.\nBut Hamilton, who has gone to Ferrari with the aim of securing a record-breaking eighth title, was far from the only driver feeling the love of the audience.\nThe most popular names were no surprise - Leclerc, Hamilton's fellow Briton Lando Norris, his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, Aston Martin's veteran legend Fernando Alonso, Carlos Sainz, now at Williams, and Mercedes' George Russell all raised the roof.\nLeclerc faced the biggest ribbing from comedian Whitehall, who took every opportunity to make a joke about the Monaco native's good looks.\nAnd there was a dash of irreverence. Norris even used a naughty word as a jokey insult during a good-natured exchange with Whitehall. One trusts FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, whose crusade against bad language is regarded as ill-conceived and poorly handled by most in F1, will decide not to pursue it on this occasion.\nCertainly celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, who has a commercial deal with the sport, will think so. \"If it comes out, it comes out,\" Ramsay said as he was interviewed in the VIP area about the topic. \"Let them be real.\"\nBen Sulayem would certainly be wise not to sour the good taste left by an event that appears to have been a resounding success.\nThis video can not be played\nAntonelli was 'really nervous' ahead of driving test\nIn among the well-choreographed but also genuine celebrations of a new season, though, there was one 'gulp' moment, when Christian Horner was booed loudly as he came out on stage to host during his Red Bull team's presentation.\nAnyone wondering whether that was directed at Horner personally or the team found out the answer shortly afterwards when the cheers for four-time champion Max Verstappen drowned out a few boos.\nF1 had pulled out all the stops for this event, the first of its kind. It was nominally held to mark the 75th anniversary of the World Championship, but one imagines F1 owners Liberty Media may well be pushing for a repeat after this.\nThe attendance of all 10 teams and 20 drivers was required, and while some were more willing participants than others - Verstappen, in particular, was known not to be a fan - all were on their best behaviour, during the seven hours of media build-up to the event at a next-door hotel, and during the show itself.\nRock musician Machine Gun Kelly opened the show, and Take That closed it; there were other acts during it.\nWhitehall was a warm and witty host, poking fun at the \"beef\" between George Russell and Verstappen - \"how can anyone have a beef with George?\" he said. \"He's the nicest guy in the world.\"\nThis video can not be played\nRussell: 'Me and Max won't be best mates'\nEverything went off with an almost military precision, each team using their seven-minute allocation during the evening for their own unique style of presentation.\nMany in F1 had questioned what the show was for, but on the evidence of the night, that was obvious.\nA normal pre-season is marked by a drip-feed of individual launches by the teams. Some garner more attention than others, but none attract the sort of worldwide attention this event seems to have drawn - the audience on F1's YouTube channel peaked at 1.1m concurrent viewers, and totalled 4.6m across the live broadcast.\n\"This is a new milestone, such an amazing event,\" Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said.\nThe presentations were done in reverse order of last year's constructors' championship, so the last team to do their presentation were McLaren.\n\"It's a pleasure to be here tonight,\" Norris said. \"We're all excited. A lot of hard work and today it starts.\"\nThe last word spoken by a competitor on the evening went to his ultimate boss, McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown. He judged it perfectly.\n\"We never stop racing,\" Brown said. \"Let's go.\"\nOscar Piastri (left) and Lando Norris brought McLaren their first constructors' championship since 1998 last season\nDrivers forced to make at least two stops in Monaco",

Just continue and you are going to score many goals.\"\nChelsea back in top four with Southampton win\nPalmer started the season in red-hot form for the Blues, scoring 14 goals and creating six assists across his first 21 Premier League appearances. However, he has zero goal involvements since.\nMany Chelsea supporters, as well as Fantasy Football fans, had pencilled in Chelsea's home match against a Southampton side who sit bottom of the league and have the worst defensive record as the fixture where Palmer would restart his goalscoring form.\nAnd the former Manchester City man did find himself on the end of several chances, having seven shots - the joint-highest total for a Chelsea player in the league this season.\nPalmer missed two glorious opportunities when one-on-one in the first half with one effort saved by Aaron Ramsdale and another dragged wide. After the restart he blasted a cut-back over the bar.\nIn total, his chances accumulated to an expected goals (xG) figure of 1.07.\nAfter he had a late free-kick saved by Ramsdale, Palmer reacted by smiling, appearing to see the funny side of his barren run, which Maresca praised in his post-match press conference.\n\"It is how you react. He is reacting perfectly. He is smiling and he is happy. We have no doubt he will score more goals,\" Maresca said.\n\"He's a human being. All human beings, all big players, all the normal players, big club, big manager - we all go through  a bad moment.\n\"Even if he is young, he shared time in a big club and he knows that all the big players go through moments like this.\"\nPalmer joined Chelsea from Manchester City in September, 2023 and has since scored 39 goals across all competitions.\nPedro Neto has scored three Premier League goals this season\nStepping up on Tuesday were forwards Christopher Nkunku and Pedro Neto who both scored one and assisted another.\nWith striker Nicolas Jackson absent with a thigh injury, Neto, who was signed as a winger, once again played centrally in a false-nine role.\n\"We needed to find a solution,\" added Maresca. \"We tried one game with Palmer and we tried one game with Nkunku, Brighton away \u2013 didn't work well.\n\"So the week after, we tried with Pedro in the week and we saw that it could work. I think Villa away he did fantastic. He probably give us a threat in-behind.\nNeto scored Chelsea's second, running on to a Nkunku through-ball before calmly finishing past Ramsdale.\n\"He is not just receiving the ball at the feet,\" added Maresca. \"He also likes to attack in-behind something which Cole and Christopher struggle [to do].\"\nNeto has scored just three goals and created four assists in the Premier League this season, although two of those goals and two of those assists have come in the past four games.\nBefore the match with Southampton about 100 Chelsea fans protested against the club's ownership with banners and chants.\nIt has been nearly three years since the BlueCo consortium fronted by Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali acquired the club.\n\"The only thing I can say is that in this moment the fans have to trust,\" said Maresca.\n\"We're in the right process and the right direction. Since we started we've been top four most games of the season.\n\"The fans have to trust the players.

        "article_text": "As the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is meant to be drawing to an end, it has once again been put in doubt.\nAfter the last six living Israel hostages due to be released in this phase were freed, more than 600 Palestinian prisoners were due to be released by Israel in exchange - the biggest number so far to be freed in one go. \nBut that has now been delayed indefinitely by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with his demand that Hamas must stop what he called its \"cynical use of hostages for propaganda purposes\". Hamas has in turn accused Israel of deliberately trying to disrupt the ceasefire agreement.\nIt's the latest big bump in the road that's intended ultimately to lead to a permanent end to hostilities and the start of rebuilding Gaza.\nIsrael complained about the chaotic scenes in one of the first handovers, saying the physical safety of the hostages had been put in jeopardy. Then, Israel said Hamas had broken the terms of the agreement by not releasing a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehud. \nIn response, it delayed opening access for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to the north of Gaza for 48 hours. That was resolved when Arbel Yehud was freed in an extra handover before the next scheduled for the following Saturday.\nHamas later accused Israel of not living up to its commitments to permit heavy machinery, tents and caravans into Gaza. It then said it would not carry out the next hostage handover as scheduled. \nThat prompted threats from both Netanyahu and the US President Donald Trump that all out war would resume in Gaza if the hostages weren't freed as agreed.  With the clock ticking down, Hamas agreed to release them.\nAnd just in the past few days, the discovery that the body Hamas handed over on Thursday as that of Shiri Bibas turned out not to be her. That set off new anger and shock in Israel, where the images of Shiri trying to shield her two young children as they were abducted on 7 October, 2023, is seen as the most potent symbol of the horror of that day. \nNetanyahu denounced Hamas for what he called  a \"cruel and evil violation\" of the agreement. Once again, the ceasefire was kept on track only at the last moment by Hamas providing another body within a day that this time did indeed prove to be hers.\nAll these incidents have shown how fragile the ceasefire process remains. They may also have contributed to the fact talks on the second phase - due to start earlier this month - have not yet got under way. Time is running out, with the first phase due to end in a week's time.\nHamas has offered to release the remaining hostages due to be freed in the second phase in one go, but only if Israel pulls all its forces out of Gaza and there is a permanent end to the war.\nIsrael has demanded the complete disarmament of Hamas, which it has so far rejected. The stage-managed ceremonies at each hostage handover, which Netanyahu has so strongly condemned, are intended to show it is still a force to be reckoned with in Gaza.\nIn Israel, voices on the right demand the government resumes its war against Hamas, while the families of the hostages - backed by much of Israel - say securing the release of the remaining hostages is what matters above and beyond all else.\nTrump's plan for Gaza has brought new uncertainty into the equation. The third phase of the ceasefire is meant to set Gaza on the path towards reconstruction and renewal. \nArab states are hurriedly trying to come up with a concrete alternative proposal in which Palestinians would continue to live in Gaza while it is rebuilt, rather than being removed from the enclave as envisaged in Trump's plan.\nThe future governance of Gaza also remains a key sticking point, with Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority and Arab countries all so far appearing to have contradictory proposals.\nThese issues will require difficult negotiations, which will be conducted amid the constant risk of a return to war, for which some on both sides continue to advocate.\nBut for now, the mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US may have their work cut out just getting the first phase of the ceasefire over the line.",

        "article_text": "A French former surgeon accused of abusing hundreds of patients, most of them children, has told a court that he admits to having \"committed despicable acts\" and \"understands and shares the suffering\" caused to his alleged victims.\nJoel Le Scouarnec is accused of assaulting or raping 299 patients, the vast majority under 15 years old, between 1989 and 2014, mostly in Brittany. \n\"I am perfectly aware that these wounds are indelible, beyond repair,\" Le Scouarnec said, in a halting but clear voice. \nThe white-haired 74-year-old, who wore glasses and a black zip-up sweater over a grey shirt, was addressing the court in Vannes, north-west France, on the first day of the largest child abuse trial in French history.\nWarning: This story contains distressing details\n\"I can't go back, but I owe it to [the victims] and their relatives to admit my actions and the consequences they had and that they undoubtedly will continue to have throughout their lives,\" Le Scouarnec told the court.\nThroughout the day - which was mainly devoted to technical proceedings - he had looked attentive but had no particular reaction when two visibly nervous men in their 30s took the stand to identify themselves as his victims.\nThe youngest of Le Scouarnec's alleged victims was aged one and the oldest 70.  \nPolice were able to identify them thanks to meticulously-compiled diaries in which Le Scouarnec is alleged to have logged assaults he carried out on his young patients over more than 25 years.\nHe has already been imprisoned since 2017 for abusing four children, of which he was found guilty in 2020.\nMany of the plaintiffs were allegedly abused while they were under anaesthesia or recovering from surgeries in hospitals across northern France - meaning a number of them had no recollection of the abuse they are said to have sustained, and had to be told by police that their names appeared in Le Scouarnec's diaries. \n\"Everything in this terrible story is out of the ordinary... it wasn't the victims that approached the investigators but the investigators that alerted the victims,\" public prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger said in court.\n\"Many of them had no memory... several would have rather gone on not knowing. But silence had reigned for too long.\" \nMany other people, who do remember being allegedly abused, have said the impact of the events has followed them their whole lives, in many cases resulting in serious psychological trauma. \nMauricette Vinet, the grandmother of a patient of Le Scouarnec who killed himself some years ago, told the BBC her grandson Mathis had been \"killed\" by Le Scouarnec's alleged abuse.\n\"If he hadn't happened Mathis would still be here,\" she said. \nDefence lawyer Maxime Tissier told the trial on Monday that Le Scouarnec admitted to the \"vast majority\" of the charges against him and that his client would soon \"explain himself\" with regard to the accusations.\n\"He is a defendant who has made himself entirely available to the court... despite his age,\" Mr Tissier said.\nLe Scouarmec added in court that during his police examinations he did his best to \"admit to the events which constituted rape and those that, in my view, did not\".\nDozens of lawyers were also present in court, but the hundreds of alleged victims they represent were sat in a separate overflow room due to their sheer number. Several psychologists and emotional support dogs will be on hand throughout the course of the trial. \nAude Buresi, the presiding judge, read out a graphic and gruelling summary of the charges against Le Scouarnec, as well as excerpts from his interrogations in 2020, in which the former surgeon initially denied that his diaries reflected real-life abuse and were merely retellings of his \"fantasies\". \nBut Ms Buresi said several elements - including the level of detail and choice of words used by Le Scouarnec - indicated that the diaries were most likely truthful.\nIn his short statement to the court on Monday, the former surgeon referred to his writings as \"very violent\". \nAn hour before proceedings kicked off a few dozen protesters staged a rally outside the courtroom, carrying letters spelling out the phrase \"Stop the code of silence\", while another sign read \"Who knew?\" \nVictims and child advocacy groups have said \"systemic failures\" allowed Le Scouarnec to continue working with children.\nIn 2005, the FBI warned the French authorities that he had been accessing child abuse websites, but this just resulted in a suspended sentence and he faced no consequences in the workplace.\nLater, when Le Scouarnec was working in the hospital of Quimperl\u00e9, he allegedly made sexually-charged comments about a young patient of his, raising the suspicions of a colleague who alerted the regional medical association and made them aware of the suspended sentence.\nThe members of the association were summoned and all but one doctor - who abstained - voted that Le Scouarnec had not violated the medical code of ethics. The BBC has approached the regional medical association for comment\nThe association is now pressing charges against Le Scouarnec for \"bringing the medical profession into disrepute,\" the body's secretary Didier Robin said on Monday.\nHis statement elicited a swift rebuttal from lawyer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Benoist, who represents a child protection advocacy group La Voix de L'Enfant (The Child's Voice) and has previously told the BBC that Le Scouarnec was able to commit his deeds due to \"a huge degree of dysfunction\" among medical professionals.\nMr Benoist said it was \"morally indecent and legally questionable\" that the medical association was allowed to be listed as a plaintiff. \"It is unacceptable that [the association] is sat alongside the victims,\" he said. \nMonday's session closed early - something that is unlikely to happen again over the course of the trial, which will run on a tight schedule and is due to end in June.\nAt the request of the plaintiffs, some sessions will be held behind closed doors - but big portions of it will be open to journalists and members of the public.\nLe Scouarnec's ex-wife and his siblings will be heard in court on Tuesday.\nAsked why she was attending proceedings that will undoubtedly include sordid and graphic details of abuse, one woman queuing to enter the overflow room told the BBC she wanted to see \"this doctor, this Mr Everyman\".\n\"I want to see what human nature can be capable of, because all of this - it's just beyond me,\" she said.",

        "article_text": "In the heart of what was once Britain's largest colony in the New World, a \"secret\" church reveals how Black people lived and worshipped in the US's earliest days.\nThe peal of a church bell cuts through the humid air in Williamsburg, Virginia. It's not just a call to worship; it's a declaration of resilience, faith and freedom. Since the United States' founding in 1776, African Americans have gathered at First Baptist Church, making it one of the nation's oldest continuous Black congregations.\nFounded in 1632, Williamsburg served as the political and cultural capital of Britain's largest colony in the New World from 1699 to 1780. Today, Colonial Williamsburg \u2013 a 301-acre historic district featuring more than 600 restored and reconstructed homes, shops and taverns \u2013 is sometimes hailed as the \"world's largest living history museum\". Exploring its cobbled streets and interacting with its costumed interpreters offers a rare opportunity for visitors to time travel to the US's earliest days.\nWilliamsburg's taverns and government halls are where the US Founding Fathers debated the course of a new nation. Meanwhile, free and enslaved Black people \u2013 who comprised more than 52% of the town's population \u2013 toiled in its kitchens, built its homes and grew okra, basil and peanuts in its fields. They cooked the meals at King's Arms Tavern, crafted the bricks that line Duke of Gloucester Street and transported dignitaries in horse-drawn carriages, helping to shape the culture and foundation of what would become the United States.\nYet, it was illegal for Black residents to worship in a church without white supervision. \"We did it anyway,\" said Connie Harshaw, president of the Let Freedom Ring Foundation, which works to conserve First Baptist Church's buildings and artefacts.\nThe church, founded by free and enslaved African Americans at the height of the American Revolution, is one of the first independent Black congregations in America. Its existence reveals how Black Americans were actively shaping their own destiny, even as they were denied basic human rights. Yet, for too long, the nation's foremost site of early American history offered only a fleeting acknowledgement of this story, mirroring the US's broader failure to reckon with its past.\nWorshippers first met in secret, gathering on nearby plantations and later in a secluded, densely wooded area known as Raccoon Chase, where a historical plaque now stands. In 1776 \u2013 the same year the Declaration of Independence ironically proclaimed \"All men are created equal\" \u2013 the loosely knit congregation formalised itself as the Baptist \"African church\".\nBy 1805, a white landowner offered congregants a swampy plot on Nassau Street where they built their first meetinghouse. Although a tornado destroyed the church in 1834, the congregation, then 500 strong, rebuilt a larger brick church on the same spot in 1856. Women raised funds to purchase a bell for the steeple, which called worshippers to service for decades before falling into disuse.\nBy the 20th Century, the thriving congregation was now called First Baptist Church, but new threats emerged. Beginning in 1926, businessman and philanthropist John D Rockefeller Jr and Reverend Dr WAR Goodwin planned Williamsburg's restoration, focusing only on structures central to the settlement's Anglican and white colonial past. First Baptist Church didn't fit that vision, and the building was demolished, paved over for a bus depot. The congregation relocated yet again to nearby Scotland Street in 1956.\nToday, Colonial Williamsburg's restored and reconstructed buildings are designed to represent life in early America, but for generations, the site failed to incorporate the stories of African Americans, who shaped and built the colonial capital.\nRediscovering America\nRediscovering America\u00a0is a BBC Travel series that tells the inspiring stories of forgotten, overlooked or misunderstood aspects of the US, flipping the script on familiar history, cultures and communities.\n\"We've always had African American interpreters in costume,\" said Janice Canady, African American Community Engagement Manager at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and a descendent of the church's early members. \"But telling the fuller story has been a struggle. People aren't always comfortable with the truth,\" she said.\nPart of the challenge with uncovering that truth was that much of Williamsburg's Black history was passed down orally, making it difficult to pin down hard facts. In 2016, a dedicated steering committee was formed to document First Baptist Church's history and secure its rightful place in Williamsburg's narrative. One of the committee's first initiatives was restoring the church's early bell that hadn't rung since segregation. \"It's the sound of freedom when it rings,\" Harshaw said.\nWhen the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture opened in Washington DC in 2016, the 500lb relic \u2013 fittingly known as the Freedom Bell \u2013 travelled to the nation's capital, where it was rung by President Barack Obama and four generations of a family descended from enslaved people for the dedication ceremony.\u00a0\nIn the years since, the committee has worked to convey that the bell, the church and everything they represent isn't just Black history; it's America's history.\n\"History happens only once,\" Harshaw said. \"We were all here at the same time, the same place. We may have had different experiences, but we have a shared history.\"\nWhat started as a search for early church records, photographs, bibles and communion sets soon became something bigger. The Let Freedom Ring Foundation was formed and, partnering with Colonial Williamsburg, they excavated the paved-over bus depot on Nassau Street. What followed was an unexpected archaeological discovery.\nIn 2020, excavations unearthed a trove of artefacts extending beyond the church that reveal how Williamsburg's early African American community lived in the face of slavery.\n\"One example is animal bones from meals being eaten on-site,\" explained Jack Gary, executive director of archaeology at Colonial Williamsburg. \"People were coming together, worshiping all day, eating together. And remains of the food they were eating were left behind.\"\u00a0\nAnalysis revealed the remains of pork, beef and poultry, but also wild game like opossum, raccoon and muskrat. \"When we shared these findings with church descendants, one cousin mentioned their family still eats muskrat today,\" Gary said. \"It's cool to make that connection, what we see in the ground and modern community.\"\nBut the most profound discovery was the burial site: 62 intact graves.\n\"We exhumed three to confirm their ancestry,\" Harshaw said. \"DNA tests and analysis confirmed they were of sub-Saharan descent. They are believed to be early congregants of the church.\"\u00a0\nIn a solemn ceremony in autumn 2024, Williamsburg dedicated dozens of grave markers to these early congregants \u2013 many of whom are directly related to area residents who still attend First Baptist Church today. Efforts are now underway to reconstruct the wood-framed meetinghouse on its original foundations. Perhaps most importantly, many feel that Colonial Williamsburg is making meaningful strides to integrate the experiences of Black residents into the settlement's broader story. In doing so, visitors come away with a more holistic understanding of how enslaved and free Black people shaped life in early America.\nOrganisers are hoping the First Baptist Church's restoration will be complete by 2026 in time for its 250th anniversary. The church's original foundations will be protected below a new modern wood-framed meetinghouse, and a glass portal will allow visitors and worshippers to peer down on some of the original bricks. Oral histories, documentary research and archaeological evidence will combine to honour First Baptist Church's story.\nNearby, another significant restoration is underway: the Bray School. Operated from 1760 to 1774, this London-funded Anglican charity taught free and enslaved Black children how to read while reinforcing the fictitious narrative that slavery was divinely ordained. Relocated nearby to the College of William & Mary in 1930, it moved to a new spot on Nassau Street within Colonial Williamsburg's historic area in 2023, adjacent to First Baptist Church's first permanent site. Now being restored to its original state, the Bray School adds yet another layer to Williamsburg's evolving historical narrative.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The Alabama museum grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n\u2022 The first free Black town in the US\n\u2022 The first Black American global superstar\nIn 2023, the US Congress approved an African American Heritage Trail in Williamsburg, another touchstone that will share the unheard side of the town's history. Together, these projects are ensuring that the Black experience is central to the visitor's experience.\nThat history continues to unfold at the modern First Baptist Church on Scotland Street, home to one of the region's most diverse congregations. Everyone is welcome to attend services, as well as to see artefacts documenting the church's rich history \u2013 including visits by civil rights leaders Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who preached from the pulpit; Rosa Parks; and Opal Lee, the \"grandmother of Juneteenth\".\nAnd, of course, the Freedom Bell is there. Visitors are invited to ring it, just as generations before them have done.\n\"In spite of and because of it all, we still stand,\" Harshaw said. \"We're dressed up every Sunday, and we're not going anywhere.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "US government workers received an email on Saturday afternoon asking them to list their accomplishments from the past week or resign - the latest development in the Trump administration's efforts to scale back the federal workforce. \nThe email came after Trump's billionaire confidant Elon Musk posted on X that employees would \"shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week\". \n\"Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation,\" he wrote.\nMusk, as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), has been leading an outside effort to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings.\nThe email arrived in inboxes shortly after Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac). The messages came with the subject line \"What did you do last week?\" from a sender listed as HR.\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal government's human resources agency, confirmed the email was authentic in a statement to CBS, the BBC's US news partner.\n\"As part of the Trump administration's commitment to an efficient and accountable federal workforce, OPM is asking employees to provide a brief summary of what they did last week by the end of Monday, CC'ing their manager,\" it said. \"Agencies will determine any next steps.\"\nIn a copy of the email obtained by the BBC, employees were asked to explain their accomplishments from the past week in five bullet points - without disclosing classified information - before midnight on Monday.\nThe message did not mention whether a failure to respond would be considered a resignation.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal employees, criticised the message as \"cruel and disrespectful\" and vowed to challenge any \"unlawful terminations\" of federal employees.\n\"Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump Administration have shown their utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people,\" Everett Kelley, union president, said in a statement.\nOn Sunday morning, Musk wrote on his social media platform X that \"a large number of responses have been received already\", adding: \"These are the people who should be considered for promotion.\"\nA few hours later, Musk said on X that the move was important because \"a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all\". \nMusk went on to say that Doge believes \"non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks\", claiming \"outright fraud\" without evidence. \nMusk has repeatedly made claims of fraud in defending his team's work across a range of government departments and functions.\nBut on Saturday, there appeared to be some disagreement about the latest email among government department heads. \nNewly-confirmed FBI director Kash Patel told his employees in an email that they should \"pause any responses\" to the OPM memo.\n\"FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting information,\" Patel wrote in a message obtained by CBS News. \"The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with the FBI procedures.\"\nThe State Department sent a similar message to its employees and said it will respond on behalf of the department. \n\"No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command,\" an email from Tibor Nagy, acting undersecretary for management, that was obtained by US media said. \nThe union that represents many government employees, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), was critical of the email and threatened legal action if employees were unlawfully terminated.\n\"It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,\" AFGE President Everett Kelley said. \nEarlier in the day, Trump touted cuts and told a crowd of supporters at Cpac that the work of federal employees had been inadequate because some of them work remotely at least some of the time.\n\"We're removing all of the unnecessary, incompetent and corrupt bureaucrats from the federal workforce,\" the president told the crowd at the annual conference in suburban Washington on Saturday afternoon.\n\"We want to make government smaller, more efficient,\" he added. \"We want to keep the best people, and we're not going to keep the worst people.\"\nElon Musk's team has exacted wide-ranging changes to the US federal infrastructure through Doge and with approval from the White House.\nThousands of government employees at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as well as other agencies, have been fired in recent weeks.\nThe email mirrors Musk's handling of employees after he acquired social media platform Twitter, now called X, in 2022. As the staff there shrunk under his ownership, he issued ultimatums that included a now-infamous request to commit to being \"extremely hardcore\" at work or resign. \nTrump has repeatedly applauded Musk's government-cutting measures. \nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said that Musk is doing a \"great job\" in reducing the size of the federal government and that he would like to see him \"get more aggressive\" in the pursuit.",

        "article_text": "Mayara Lima is famous for her hypnotising samba style. Here, she shares the best samba experiences in Rio, from traditional school events to samba circles.\nBrazilians often say that \"everything ends in samba\", but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that samba never ends \u2013 at least not in Rio de Janeiro, one of the places where the musical and dance genre is said to have originated. Aside from providing entertainment, samba has played a crucial role in shaping Rio's lifestyle, including taking a central role in its Carnival celebration \u2013 the most renowned in the world.\nMore than just a genre, samba is a cultural phenomenon that helps drive the economy, with more than 150 official rodas de samba (samba circles) across the city. At these lively gatherings, musicians sit in a circle while crowds of hundreds \u2013 or even thousands \u2013 of spectators sing along, creating an electrifying atmosphere. Meanwhile, escolas de samba (community-based \"samba schools\" that organise the world-famous Carnival parade with its giant floats and thrilling costumes) elect a rainha da bateria (queen of the drums) who leads the school's bateria (drum section), captivating the crowd and forging a powerful connection between the musicians and the audience.\nThe SpeciaList\nMayara Lima is one of Rio's most popular samba queens, having claimed the title of drum queen in 2023. She currently represents the Para\u00edso do Tuiuti samba school, where she gained national recognition for her mesmerising samba style.\nBut the energy of samba can be felt in Rio all year round. Even outside Carnival season, events like samba school street rehearsals offer a vibrant and immersive experience. We asked\u00a0Mayara Lima, a rainha de bateria (drum queen) at Parara\u00edso do Tuiti, one of Rio's most renowned samba schools, how to experience the city's rich samba culture during Carnival and beyond.\nLima knew from an early age that dance was her calling, and she joined a samba school at age 10. \"I had studied other rhythms, such as ballet and jazz, but I decided to be fully dedicated to samba,\" she says.\nLima is a proud carioca \u2013 a Rio native. \"To me, Rio is far more than just a city,\" she says. \"What makes Rio so unique is the way it combines breathtaking natural beauty \u2013 its beaches and trails \u2013 with the energy of a vibrant, urban metropolis, where every neighbourhood has its own distinct charm and history.\" She adds: \"[But] you can't talk about Rio without talking about samba, can you? Their histories are intertwined.\"\nAhead of the 2025 Carnival, which runs from 28 February to 8 March, here are five of Lima's favorite samba experiences in Rio.\nRio's samba school parade is a global spectacle every Carnival season. Of the more than 70 samba schools, only a select few belong to the elite group that takes centre stage, parading down the Samb\u00f3dromo Marqu\u00eas de Sapuca\u00ed during the festivities \u2013 but the schools promote several events during the year that take place in the quadras (samba school headquarters), which play a key role in strengthening ties between the schools and the local community.\nTip:\nRio's music scene is about more than just samba. \"Baile Charme, an old-school R&B event, under the Madureira viaduct every Saturday [starts] at 20:00 and ends at the sunrise at 05:00,\" says Lima. This event has been going strong for over 20 years and remains a huge success, attracting thousands of people every week. \"It's a great way to see another side of Rio's music scene.\"\nCariocas and visitors of all ages come to samba schools to watch rehearsals, participate in feijoadas (a traditional feast of black beans and pork) and enjoy live performances of the school's samba anthem; a new one is chosen each year to serve as the narrative musical thread for each performance.\n\"There are 12 main samba schools [in Rio], which means 12 opportunities to experience samba,\" says Lima. \"While there's no fixed schedule for events, something is always happening. Each school hosts feijoadas several times a year. They feature guest performers playing not just samba, but also pagode [a type of samba/subgenre of samba] and carioca funk.\"\nFor Lima, the Gr\u00eamio Recreativo Escola de Samba Acad\u00eamicos do Salgueiro samba school holds one of Rio's best feijoadas. \"It's a thrilling event, it often happens in the first Monday of each month,\" she says. But her favourite type of samba school event is undoubtedly street rehearsals. \"As Carnival approaches, we hold street rehearsals every Monday in front of the samba school before heading inside to continue practicing,\" she says. \"It's amazing!\"\nEach school announces its events on social media. Street rehearsals are free, but other events, such as feijoada feast and samba circles, usually require a ticket.\u00a0\nWebsite: www.salgueiro.com.br\nAddress: R. Silva Teles, 104 - Andara\u00ed\nPhone: +552238-9226\nInstagram: @salgueirooriginal\n\u00a0\nPedra do Sal \u2013 a sloping set of stone steps found in Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, known as Rio's \"Little Africa\" \u2013 is believed to have been the birthplace of samba in the early 20th Century. When the area served as a market for enslaved people and the unloading point for salt (sal in Portuguese) shipments, it also became a gathering place for enslaved Africans, who came together to honour their deities and play the instruments that became part of samba's DNA, like the pandeiro (tambourine).\nDuring the day, Pedra do Sal's rich history attracts small groups of tourists eager to understand Rio's past. But as the sun sets, the streets fill with vendors and hundreds of visitors drawn to the city's most famous roda de samba.\nOnce held only on Monday nights, the event grew so popular that organisers expanded it to four nights a week, from Friday to Monday \u2013 though Monday remains the busiest night. The music spills over Pedra do Sal's famous steps, creating an electrifying, open-air celebration.\n\"Pedra do Sal attracts such a diverse crowd \u2013 you'll find people from all over the city, from different backgrounds, and loads of tourists too,\" says Lima. \"It's a great mix, and that reflects in the music. Samba is the essence, but you'll hear other rhythms too.\"\nAddress: Rua Argemiro Bulc\u00e3o, s/n, Sa\u00fade,\nInstagram: @pedradosaloficial\nIn the city's northern zone, 21km from the historic Copacabana beach, hundreds of samba enthusiasts gather at the Pagode do Chinelo roda in the Pilares borough, right next to the renowned samba school Caprichosos de Pilares.\nLike most rodas de samba, the gathering started with modest expectations \u2013 just a group of friends meeting every Monday for a cold beer and some samba \u2013 but the samba do Chinelo quickly became a sensation and is now one of Rio\u2019s official rodas de samba, attracting locals and celebrities alike, and has since evolved into a professionally structured event.\n\"This is one of those places everyone goes to. It's a given that it'll be packed every Monday, with plenty of famous faces in the crowd. Sometimes you even see singers like [Grammy winner] Ludmilla performing \u2013 it's really cool,\" says Lima.\nThe event kicks off at 18:00 and carries on into the late night. Pagode do Chinelo is also the perfect spot to experience different samba styles. \"It's a great place to enjoy a more melodic samba, which is slower, or samba partido-alto, which is faster and more upbeat. It's brilliant fun,\" says Lima.\nAddress: Rua Faleiros, 1, Pilares\nInstagram: @resenhapagodeechinelo\n4. Best for experiencing classic samba: Cacique de Ramos\u00a0\nThe northern zone of the city is also home to one of Rio's most traditional rodas de samba.\nTip:\nFor those looking for a more laid-back way to explore Rio, Lima recommends having breakfast inside the Jardim Bot\u00e2nico. \"Some of the cafes in the garden allow you to enjoy a morning meal surrounded by nature overlooking century-old trees,\" she says \"It\u2019s the perfect place to start your day in a relaxing atmosphere before exploring the city's other attractions.\"\nFounded in the 1960s, Cacique de Ramos became famous for its legendary samba gatherings, where some of the genre's most celebrated artists first rose to prominence. Often described as the \"headquarters of samba\", it has played a pivotal role in shaping Rio's Carnival culture.\n\"This is where you'll find classic samba,\" says Lima. \"Cacique de Ramos is the birthplace of many greats, including Arlindo Cruz, Zeca Pagodinho and Beth Carvalho. If you want to experience that unique energy, this is the place to go.\"\nThe samba takes place every Sunday in Cacique de Ramos samba hall, making it an ideal option for those looking to enjoy a lively evening without a late finish. \"Since it's on a Sunday, Cacique de Ramos wraps up around midnight,\" says Lima. \"So if you need to be up early the next day but still want to make the most of your weekend, it's perfect. It's definitely one of my favourites.\"\nWebsite: www.caciquederamos.com.br\nAddress: Rua Uranos, 1326 - Olaria\nPhone: +55213251-4374\nInstagram: @cacique_de_ramos\nBar\u00f3dromo is a well-known samba venue among cariocas and a favourite gathering spot for samba enthusiasts. The walls are adorned with Carnival costumes and masks, immersing guests in the samba atmosphere the moment they step inside.\n\"It's always buzzing, absolutely packed,\" says Lima. \"It's a bar with a proper traditional samba roda, where people clap along to the beat \u2013 it's such a great vibe. The whole place is dedicated to samba, and that's what makes it so special.\"\nThe venue is open from Tuesday to Sunday, with samba sessions every night, ranging from performances of traditional samba to live sets from samba school baterias.\nBar\u00f3dromo is a popular venue that frequently fills to capacity, occasionally leading to slower service.

We will miss you, Jimmy.\"\nMartin was born in Glasgow's Partick, but lived for a long period in Musselburgh, East Lothian.\nHe joined the Royal Navy at the age of 17 and spent 16 years in the fire service before becoming an actor.\nMartin was awarded the British Empire Medal in the 2024 King's birthday honours for his services to military charities.\nHe began acting regularly in the 1980s, including appearances in Taggart and Take the High Road, before joining Still Game - a spinoff of comedy sketch show Chewin' the Fat.\nEric was a regular presence in The Clansman alongside Jack and Victor (Kiernan and Hemphill), as well as Winston, played by Paul Riley, Tam, played by Mark Cox, Isa, played by Jane McCarry and barman Boaby, played by Gavin Mitchell.\nThe beloved character helped lure tight-fisted Tam into a poker night at Jack's flat, graphically described the effects of aging on the human body to the long-term friends and found out, to his cost, the dangers of tampering with a fire hydrant on a hot day.\nParts of his real-life back story were worked into that of his character on the long-running show when he became the first customer of new Craiglang funeral director Iain Duncan Sheathing in 2018.\nThat was only after he claimed to have carried out a summer romance with Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida in Rome, which was later found to be untrue after the character's funeral.\nHe also appeared in Peter McDougall's Just Another Saturday, Rab C Nesbitt and Netflix comedy Lovesick.\nPosting on Facebook, Red Shoe Entertainment wrote: \"We are deeply saddened to share the news that Jimmy Martin, the beloved actor known for playing Eric in Still Game, has passed away.\n\"His warmth, humour, and unforgettable performances brought joy to so many, and his legacy will live on through the laughter he shared with the world.\n\"Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and all who loved him.

        "article_text": "In the past month alone, shadowy portraits have been found hidden in longstanding masterpieces by Titian and Picasso. What can they and other such discoveries tell us?\nSomething's stirring. Every few weeks, it seems, brings news of a sensational discovery in the world of art \u2013 of paintings hidden under other paintings and vanished visages twitching beneath the varnish of masterpieces whose every square millimetre we thought we knew. This past month alone has brought to light the detection of mysterious figures trapped beneath the surface of works by Titian and Picasso. But what are we to make of this slowly swelling collection of secret stares \u2013 these absent presences that simultaneously delight and disturb?\nIn early February, it was revealed that researchers at the Andreas Pittas Art Characterization Laboratories at the Cyprus Institute, using advanced imaging and a new multi-modal scanner combining different techniques, had proved the existence of an upside-down portrait of a mustachioed man holding a quill beneath the Italian Renaissance master Titian's painting Ecce Homo, 1570-75. On its surface, Titian's canvas portrays a bedraggled Jesus, hands bound by ropes, standing shoulder to shoulder with a sumptuously dressed Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who will sentence him to death. What is this strange, erased, anachronistic scribe doing here and what is he trying to tell us?\nThe presence of the hidden portrait, who peers imperceptibly through the craquelure \u2013 those alluring cracks in old master paintings \u2013 was first described by the art historian Paul Joannides and its significance to the surface narrative is more than incidental. While the identity of the topsy-turvy figure has yet to be determined, it is clear he helped shape the wrenching composition under which he has been buried for the past 450 years. The analysis of the materiality of the painting's layers in Cyprus has shown that the contours of the hidden figure's face dictated the curve of ropes binding Jesus's hands \u2013 establishing notes of harmony between the successive and seemingly contrary compositions.\nThat sense of quiet collaboration between layers of paint \u2013 between what is there and what used to be there \u2013 is more striking still in the hidden countenance of a woman found by conservators at The Courtauld Institute of Art beneath a painting from Pablo Picasso's Blue Period \u2013 a portrait of the artist's friend and sculptor Mateu Fern\u00e1ndez de Soto. Also discovered with the use of infrared imaging technology, the portrait of the as-yet unidentified woman is rendered in an earlier, more impressionistic style, and appears, when brought to the surface, to be whispering into de Soto's ear, as if the past and present had merged into a single suspended moment.\nIn most instances, these buried portraits are merely the ghosts of rejected compositions that we were never intended to see \u2013 and could not have, were it not for the aid of advanced imaging tools that allow experts safely to peer beneath the paint without harming a work's surface. X-rays uncover hidden sketches, while infrared reflectography is capable of exposing subtle details masked by old varnish \u2013 details which, once glimpsed, are impossible to unknow. Once revealed, these portraits demand to be reckoned with. What follows is a short survey of some of the most intriguing and mysterious portraits \u2013 very often self-portraits \u2013 found wriggling restlessly beneath familiar masterpieces: unsettling presences that remain forever immeasurably close and worlds away.\nThink of Rembrandt and we tend to think first of that dim, imperishable realm in which his sitters sit outside of time \u2013 an eternal stage crafted from charcoal and sombrous umber. What we don't think of is giddy greens and garish vermilions igniting the space with vibrancy and verve. But that is exactly what researchers found staring back at them when they subjected the Dutch master's painting, An Old Man in Military Costume, to macro X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) imaging and infrared reflectography. Trapped beneath Rembrandt's meditation on mortality, a giddy ghost of jaunty youth clad in raffish reds and incorrigible verdigris intensifies the poignancy of his masterwork.\nWith some paintings, the more we see the less we know. Take Artemisia Gentileschi's portrait of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, 1619. X-ray analysis of the Italian Baroque artist's work undertaken in 2019 revealed that she began the work as a self-portrait \u2013 one that closely resembles an earlier, and similarly entitled, Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria, begun around 1615. Disentangling the two works' faces is tricky but scholars now think that the final work \u2013 which swaps a turban for a crown and a piercing stare for a pious, heavenly gaze \u2013 blends elements of the artist's own likeness with those of Caterina de' Medici, daughter of the Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici, who commissioned the work. The result is proof that while an artist may be able to let go of a painting, a painting can never completely let go of the artist.\u00a0\nCaravaggio only signed one painting during his lifetime and did so with ghoulish flair in a squiggle of blood at the bottom of the largest painting he ever made, The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist, 1608. But that is hardly the only time the Italian master inserted a semblance of himself into his paintings. In 2009, scholars using advanced reflectography penetrated the cracked surface of Caravaggio's depiction of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, to rehabilitate a tiny self-portrait that he had secreted in the reflection of the carafe (an almost subliminal detail that clumsy restoration efforts had obscured after the portrait-within-a-portrait was first discovered in 1922). This strange, distorted, now-you-see-it-now-you-don't selfie in the vessel of wine is key to the work's meaning, amplifying as it does themes of drunken illusion and elastic identity that are central to Caravaggio's painting.\nOn the surface, Young Woman Powdering Herself is a playful meditation on how subject and style overlap. Here, Georges Seurat employs his pioneering pointillist technique of countless tiny dots to depict his mistress, Madeleine Knobloch, as she scatters her own flurry of powdery specks across her face. The dabs of paint seem to swirl in the air, all but clogging it \u2013 metaphorically powdering, too, anyone who stops to stare. These deftly deployed dabs of paint reveal and erase in equal measure, as if conjuring a world only to blot it out again. That sense of brilliant obliteration is intensified with the discovery of a hidden self-portrait \u2013 Seurat's only known one \u2013 in the open window which he later concealed beneath another flurry of dots depicting a vase of flowers. How dotty is that?\nSome people refuse to be forgotten, no matter how hard you scrub them from your memory. Italian modernist Amedeo Modigliani's famous Portrait of a Girl, 1917, is a compelling case in point. Some scholars suspect that the full-length portrait of a woman, concealed beneath the visible image, may depict an ex-lover with whom Modigliani ended a relationship a year earlier. In 2021, two PhD candidates at the University of London used Artificial Intelligence to reconstruct this hidden portrait, which strikingly resembles Modigliani's former muse and mistress, Beatrice Hastings. While the identity of both women, surface and hidden, remains uncertain, the layering reinforces themes of concealment and masking in Modigliani's work.\nIn his painting La Cinqui\u00e8me Saison, 1943, Ren\u00e9 Magritte portrays in profile two nearly identical men in dark suits and bowler hats \u2013 props that often signal the presence of his alter-ego in the artist's work. Both men hold small, framed paintings under their arms as they walk towards each other. The trajectory of their strides suggests not so much an imminent collision as a near miss \u2013 an eclipse, as one figure and painting slips behind the other. It somehow seems fitting that this painting \u2013 this painting of shuffling paintings \u2013 has been found, with the use of infrared reflectography, to be hiding under its surface another painting altogether: a portrait of a mysterious woman, who at once bears a strong resemblance to the artist's wife, Georgette, and has features that are wholly distinct. The discovery of the hidden portrait merely amplifies themes of riddling duality in the work of an artist known for his treacherously teasing images.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Istanbul is one of the world's biggest cities, growing larger still every year. Its rapid expansion is putting enormous stress on its water supplies.\nJodie Harburt often talks about the buzzard. In the wetlands of \u015eile, the town she lives in \u2013 absorbed many years ago into greater Istanbul \u2013 Harburt used to see a buzzard alight on the marshes beside the river, a small predatory wonder among the rich variety of birds and bugs and wildlife that called the river home.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe buzzard left, like an omen, when the municipality began to line the river with concrete.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"This area is supposed to be spongy, because that's where the water is supposed to stay. It's a huge water depot,\" says Harburt. \"If you want to avoid drought situations, you have to keep the water in the soil, and you can't do that if you've lined the whole river with concrete.\"\nThe problems of one small river in \u015eile is a ripple out from the large problem that threatens to splash down on Istanbul: what happens if the city runs out of water?\nIn January 2021, the residents of Istanbul slowly, and then quickly, became inundated with ominous headlines: Istanbul could run out of water in 45 days. With reservoirs at shocking lows and little forthcoming winter rain, it was within the realm of possibility that a city of more than 15 million people might soon have no drinking water. Under the instruction of the Diyanet, Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs, Friday services at Istanbul's mosques included prayers for rain and water.\nIt wasn't the first time this has happened. Similar headlines bubble up in Istanbul's news outlets every few years. For four days in 2014, the Kadikoy neighbourhood of Istanbul had no water. At first, it was an inconvenience. In a city as large as Istanbul, water cuts occasionally happen, and residents grumble but get on and wait for the water to come back. But as the water cut extended to two days, and then three, the neighbourhood began to smell and people looked more and more frantic. By day four, there were full-blown protests as people demanded that the local government restore their water.\nNow, the warning bells are ringing again. As recently as 4 October 2024, the reservoir levels were very low, at only 37.4% capacity. In December 2023, Agriculture and Forestry Minister \u0130brahim Yumakl\u0131 announced that Turkey was at risk of experiencing extreme water scarcity by 2030, and that much of the population might feel the effect of water shortages in the next six years.\nKucukcekmece Lake, an important source of water in Istanbul, is at risk of becoming polluted and running dry. Drought is at the doorstep. Day Zero, when the water runs out, is a slow-arriving disaster that is an easy one to ignore \u2013 until it arrives.\u00a0\n\"Istanbul is already facing significant water scarcity, and we're approaching ecological limits,\" says Akg\u00fcn \u0130lhan, a lecturer who specialises in urban water management and its intersection with climate change at Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University. \"We need to face this reality, or we can continue to ignore it and face the consequences.\"\u00a0\nIstanbul is a city of water, hemmed in by it on all sides: the Black Sea to the north, the Sea of Marmara to the south, and the Bosphorus Strait bisecting the centre of the city itself \u2013 all salt water bodies, with no river to provide freshwater. As its status as a city of local and global importance has grown, the city has stretched out, swallowed its suburbs, and become very, very thirsty.\nAlways a major city, Istanbul is now a megacity, with its population ballooning in the second half of the 20th Century. In the 1950's, Istanbul had a million residents; by the 1980s, there were five million. Now, there are roughly 17 million. As the population rises, so does the demand for water; as residential areas develop on Istanbul's water basins, less water is available within the city itself.\u00a0\nIn reaction, \u0130SK\u0130, the city's water authority, has built dam infrastructure designed to bring water from villages hundreds of kilometres outside of the city into Istanbul. But when this infrastructure drains the water reservoir of these villages and damages agriculture, the residents are often forced to uproot and move \u2013 often to Istanbul, expanding its population and exacerbating the problem.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Istanbul is fed by the whole of Turkey. It's just like sucking the blood out,\" says Harburt. \"That's what cities do.\"\nIn a city with such a long history as Istanbul, the present and perhaps the future has echoes in the past's attempts to get water to an urban centre on the sea.\n\"The city thirsts,\" wrote the Greek philospher Themistius in the 4th Century about the city that would eventually be Istanbul: a prescient observation that continues to be true. Water infrastructure from ancient times is still visible in the contemporary urban fabric of the city. One major highway cuts directly under the Valens Aqueduct, which stretches out like a rainbow above the street and dates back to Themistius's time.\nOn a grey October day, Kerim Altu\u011f wanders through the nearly empty Binbirdirek Cistern in Sultanahmet on Istanbul's historic peninsula, whose name means \"1,001 columns\" but which actually only contains about 224. \"They exaggerated, because [during the time of the Ottomans] it's completely dark, there is no electricity, completely dark, and when people enter they say, maybe it goes on for eternity,\" says Altu\u011f, an archaeologist and architectural historian with a focus on Byzantine water systems.\nWhat would become Constantinople began as an ordinary Roman town within the empire. When Constantine the Great, the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity, created the city 1,700 years ago, the population increased significantly over a short amount of time. To get water to the city, the imperial government created the longest Roman water supply line in the ancient world, including massive aqueducts from the forest west of the city. \"Valens Aqueduct was the longest aqueduct system ever built in all territories of the Roman Empire,\" says Altu\u011f. \"Constantinople is unique. There were probably thousands of underground cisterns built during the Byzantine period between the 5th and the 15th Century.\"\nThat history is still palpable in the modern city. There are still nearly 200 cisterns \u2013 huge vaulted caverns for storing water \u2013 that lie underneath Istanbul's historic peninsula, with many unexcavated and others, like Binbirdirek Cistern, recently restored. Istanbul's long history of managing water infrastructure for an expanding population is a portal between past and present.\nAltu\u011f touches the pillars of Binbirdirek Cistern. \"This building was built in the 5th Century, the year 400, and it's standing. Amazing! What a treasure is that. What an achievement of engineering. What an achievement of human beings' capabilities,\" he says.\u00a0\n\"It's facile to say you can learn from the past, but the experience of the past can actually be very valuable in informing practices in the present, in the future. And that's different from learning from the past,\" says Jim Crow, an emeritus professor of Roman and Byzantine archaeology at the University of Edinburgh. Crow started working in Turkey decades ago, and became fascinated with its water infrastructure during an excavation in 1994 of the Anastasian Walls in Thrace, west of Istanbul. That dig revealed an extensive network of aqueducts hidden in the thick forest.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2021, Crow teamed up with \u0130lhan and Ender Peker, an associate professor at the Middle Eastern Technical University in Ankara, Turkey, to work on a project in collaboration with the British Institute at Ankara. Together, they conducted a series of participatory action research methodology workshops with local municipalities about rainwater harvesting projects that could potentially retain more of Istanbul's water.\u00a0\n\"The main idea was actually to look at the historical pattern of water collection systems in Istanbul and explore how it was managed in the past. So one group, mainly archaeologists and historians, were working to understand the historical pattern of water management and the other group, consisting of planners and social scientists, led by \u0130lhan and me, focused on contemporary challenges,\" says Peker. \"Mainly, the idea was to learn from the past experiences and somehow modify and implement it into the current condition.\"\nThere are two main methods of rainwater harvesting: rain collected on roofs of buildings, or rain collected in large public places. Rainwater harvesting can be used to flush toilets or wash cars or irrigate gardens when collected on roofs. Larger collections can be used for Istanbul's regular street cleaning, when municipal workers come around every morning to water-blast the rubbish and dirt out of the neighbourhoods.\nRecently, legislation was passed that made it compulsory for certain buildings built on specified parcel sizes to have rainwater harvesting capabilities and greywater systems. Local municipalities can also elect to make the parcel size smaller than the required size, which allows more buildings to qualify for law, though there's resistance from building developers. \"It's a huge challenge, in terms of creating a governance mechanism among all those actors from different levels of authority,\" says Peker.\nExpanding parkland within a city can also help retain water and prevent flooding. Sponge cities are designed to soak up as much of the rainwater naturally, with parks and wetlands holding on to the water. Istanbul, however, has a fraught relationship with its parks, and much of the rainwater that falls hits the extensive concrete of the dense city streets and rolls in the sea. Cities like Los Angeles and Bangkok have benefited from concerted efforts to create more sponge city infrastructure.\u00a0(Read BBC Future's story on how one New Zealand city is transforming its water resources.)\nThe effects of Istanbul's water problems are felt on the outskirts and outside of Istanbul, before they ripple to the centre. Villages near the Melen Dam are agriculturally devastated by the water infrastructure that brings drinking water hundreds of kilometres to Istanbul, and \u015eile's concreted rivers lead to floods locally and water seeping away from Istanbul.\u00a0\n\"It becomes difficult to manage the situation as the population keeps growing. With more people, the demand for water rises. Local authorities feel obliged to cover this ever-growing demand. In fact, in Istanbul, even a one-day water cut could destabilise the government \u2013 that's how serious it is,\" says \u0130lhan.\u00a0\n\u0130SK\u0130, the city's water authority, was asked for comment on the current state of the city's water supplies but did not provide a statement before publication.\nPeker, her partner in the water workshops, agrees. \"When you absorb water like a vampire from other sources around the hinterland of the urban area, it generates really huge problems, not only water problems, but also financial and agricultural problems for the rural areas,\" says Peker.\nHarburt sees this firsthand in \u015eile, and is trying her best to address the issues locally. She and her husband Serdar started an organisation called Suda (The Sustainable Urban Development Platform), which is proposing solutions for issues related to river conservation and water management in \u015eile. One initiative is the \u015eile Oasis Project, which weds tourism, conservation and education in a \"green route\" along \u015eile's Yeni Koy River. Inspired by the Ipswich Oasis in the UK, the plan would leave a buffer zone around the banks of the river undeveloped by builders, promote ecological regeneration, and support local businesses and tourism in a sustainable manner.\u00a0\nIn late September, Suda met the deputy mayor of \u015eile to present their proposals. As the overcast day's wind rattled through the windows, the deputy mayor was intrigued, but realistic about the main issue: political will. Implementing large urban infrastructure projects can be complicated in any city, but in a hugely polarised society like Turkey, every decision refracts through the funhouse mirrors of politics.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"We know we have the knowledge, we have the capacity, we have the motivation. The main challenge here is to construct this governance mechanism, because the deep political polarisation between the local authorities and the ministries is a big challenge,\" says Peker.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The drought that forced a Nepalese village to relocate\n\u2022\u00a0Barcelona's urgent search for water after floods\n\u2022\u00a0Can tree planting solve a water crisis?\nNow in \u015eile, as the natural reeds of the riverbed are being ripped up and covered with concrete, Jodie's buzzard looks more and more like a canary in a coal mine. It is one symptom of the complex problem of Istanbul's water.\n\"Climate change isn't simply about lack of water. It's about changing patterns, and how the city becomes more resilient in terms of these changing patterns,\" says Crow. \"Looking at the past, you're aware of the complexity of the number of factors, whether the political or external pressures, rather than one single sort of determinist. What always catches the headline is: this empire died of drought\u2026 [but] it's the complexity of the past that one needs to recognise.\"\nHarburt is going to continue to promote Suda and meet with local authorities and do her part in her small corner of Istanbul to move the needle, even a little. \"Optimism isn't a word I would use about any of this,\" she says. \"It's a determination to keep trying.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting.\nIn 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of J\u00f8rn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\"\nThe fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement.\nThe idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcast A Very Australian Scandal in 2023.\nThe creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it \u2013 the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford.\nGoossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\"\u00a0\nGoossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resulting scandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return.\nHowever, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, told BBC Witness History in 2018.\nThe judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\"\u00a0\nPremier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project.\nThe initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A\u00a33.5m or A$7m \u2013 at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott.\nThe building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott.\nTo bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 \u2013 the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open.\u00a0\nBut this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott.\nNobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History.\nAnother issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive.\nThe answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\"\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today.\u00a0Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nThis elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A\u00a312.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\"\nThe project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"\nAdding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors \u2013 the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed.\u00a0\nUtzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken.\nThe new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972.\u00a0\nBut the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (\u00a351m).\nIt was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzon declined to attend its opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\".\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The first ever video game console\n\u2022\u00a0How the fall of the Berlin Wall reshaped Europe\n\u2022\u00a0How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz\nThe Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (\u00a333m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamed the Utzon Room in his honour after being redesigned by him.\nIn the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House's visionary architecture has only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise the Australian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAs a venue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Bj\u00f6rk\u00a0and Massive Attack. In 1980,\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger\u00a0won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it.\nIn 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\"\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Synaesthesia is a neurological condition found to enhance memory and learning. Now, scientists say seeing in colour could help when it comes to learning a second language.\nMy mother's name is the colour of milk. The strings of an acoustic guitar, when strummed, play the warm yellow of honeycomb. The sound is flat, hard and smooth. And Monday is pink. These sensations are always the same, and always present. This is synaesthesia \u2013 in my case grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and sound-texture synaesthesia.\nLike many synaesthetes, I discovered at a young age I had a flair for both music and languages. In music, it wasn't the physical act of performing I excelled at, but composition. I went on to become a composer for short films and dance theatre, and a sound editor for television. Writing music felt a lot like a language to me, as I \"saw\" the colours of the sounds in a similar way. I also studied French, German, Spanish and linguistics \u2013 the colour of language helping me to remember words as well as the patterns of grammar.\nSynaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon that causes an estimated 4.4% of people to experience the world as a cacophony of sensations. Around\u00a060 different types of synaesthesia\u00a0have been identified, but there could be more than 100, with some types\u00a0experienced in clusters.\nThe condition is thought to be caused by genetically inherited traits that affect the structural and functional development of the brain. Increased communication between sensory regions in the brain means, for example, words can stimulate taste, sequences of numbers may be perceived in spatial arrangements, or the feel of textures\u00a0might conjure\u00a0emotions.\nSynaesthesia is not considered to be a neurological disorder and \u2013 although it has been linked to neurodevelopmental\u00a0and mental health conditions including autism, anxiety and schizophrenia \u2013 it is described as an \"alternative perceptual reality\" and generally thought to be beneficial.\n\"When I was younger\u00a0I knew I saw the world in a different way, and my way of describing that to others was 'colourful',\" says Smadar Frisch.\nFrisch, who has grapheme-colour synaesthesia,\u00a0sound-colour synaesthesia and lexical\u2013gustatory synaesthesia \u2013 where words have taste \u2013 explores the world of senses through her podcast, Chromatic Minds, and is currently writing her first book on the subject. \"Learning in school was too much for me sensory-wise,\" she says. \"It is very difficult trying to solve an equation\u00a0when all the colouring of a series of numbers was a psychedelic\u00a0blast.\"\nThis explosion of colour, says Frisch, would cause her to lose focus and forget what she was doing. \"[It was the] same with language. The words' colours, music and taste sensations ignited me and I wanted to express myself so much \u2013 that I lost focus.\"\nIt wasn't until she'd almost finished high school that she came across Richard Cytowic and David Eagleman's book, Wednesday is Indigo blue. \"My initial thought was that Wednesday is actually orange \u2013 and I needed to get this book.\" This was a turning point for Frisch.\u00a0\"I finally understood how my synaesthete brain is linked and wired. And I thought to myself, this phenomenon is amazing. I can use the colours to help me learn, rather than confuse me.\"\nFrisch developed a colour coding system to help her learn new languages\u00a0fluently and quickly. Studying languages no longer felt confusing but \"organised\", she says. \"And it worked! My whole world changed. I went on to learn the thing my brain was meant to excel in: languages.\"\nFrisch says she was able to learn French and Spanish fluently in just two months. \"I scored 90+ on each [French and Spanish] exam,\" she says. Today Frisch can speak seven languages fluently \u2013 and says she can learn any language she wants \"with no difficulty, in a short matter of time\".\nJulia Simner is director of the Multisense Synaesthesia Research laboratory at the University of Sussex in the UK. She and her team tested around 6,000 children who were six to 10 years old. \"We screened each one individually for synaesthesia, and then gave [them] a battery of tests to determine what skills come with synaesthesia,\" she says.\nThe study found that the children with synaesthesia were better in a number of skills than the children without \u2013 skills which, according to Simner, would \"certainly help both first and second language learning\".\n\"Specifically, they were significantly better in\u00a0receptive vocabulary (how many words they could understand), productive vocabulary (how many words they knew how to say), short term memory store, attention to detail and creativity,\" Simner says. \"These syn-linked skills predict that we might well expect second-language learning to be easier for someone with synaesthesia.\"\nHaving synaesthetic colours, she says, makes letters more memorable. And the synaesthesia colours can pass from one language into the second language learned, making words in the second language more memorable too. \"The way these colours seep across languages can either be via the way the letter looks or the way the letter sounds,\" says Simner. \"It's like the colour scaffolds across from one language to another.\"\nIn 2019, another experiment led by psychologists at the University of Toronto, Canada, found grapheme-colour synaesthesia, where each letter and number has its own distinct colour, provides a significant advantage in statistical learning \u2013 allowing a person to \"see\" patterns \u2013 an ability critical to language learning.\nThe researchers asked participants to listen to a set of nonsense words \u2013 for example, \"muh-keh\" and \"beh-od\" \u2013 representing\u00a0an artificial \"language\".\nThey then listened to a second set of words. This set included the original artificial words, plus new artificial words which represented a \"foreign\" language. The participants were then asked to distinguish \"words\" from each of the two artificial languages.\n\"It didn't have meaning,\" says Amy Finn, psychologist and director of the University of Toronto's cognitive neuroscience and developmental laboratory, Finn Land Lab. \"It was constructed to look at 'segmentation' \u2013 or how you use regularities to pull out what the segments of language\u00a0even are. This is a very early but super important problem in early language learning.\"\nThe results showed grapheme-colour synaesthetes were better able to differentiate between the two \"languages\" than participants who didn't have synaesthesia. \"We think [synaesthesia] can help you parse the chunks of language more easily,\" says Finn.\nWhen synaesthetes experience the same patterns with more than one sense \u2013 for example, both aurally\u00a0and\u00a0visually \u2013 their mind conjures a bonus secondary cue which can help them recognise or remember the pattern.\nTake 11-year-old me, put on the spot in my first week of secondary school. \"How do you say 'work'?\" demands my French teacher. The class is silent. I know the word is blue. Then it comes to me. \"Travail,\" I answer. Sometimes I can't remember a word \u2013 but I can remember the colour. This can be frustrating because no one can help me if I say \"it's pink\", as the colours are unique to my own mind. On the other hand, colour acts as an extra reminder, a bonus cue I can put to use when learning languages.\nYou might think, then, that synaesthesia would be more prevalent in bilingual children. But research suggests that people who learn a second language later than early childhood are more likely to have this sensory-switching ability than those who are natively bilingual. This bolsters the theory that synaesthesia develops as a learning tool.\nSynaesthesia emerges in childhood, as a child starts to take in the world around them, and they learn to talk, read and write. A 2016 study by researchers in Canada, the US and the Czech Republic found that children learn to categorise colours between ages of four and seven years, around the time they begin learning to read and write, and synaesthesia then begins to emerge from the age of six. The authors of the study surmise: \"Children use their newly-acquired ability to categorise colour as an unorthodox aid in mastering the domain of letters and words.\"\nHowever, synaesthesia can, on occasion, make communication more difficult \u2013 and the suggestion that synaesthesia might function as a strategy to facilitate learning \"remains a topic of debate\", says Lucie Bouvet, a psychologist at the University of Toulouse, France.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How synaesthesia inspires artists\n\u2022 The AI that 'tastes' colours\n\u2022\u00a0The adventure of raising bilingual children\n\"Phoneme-colour synaesthesia [is where] all phonemes \u2013 the smallest unit of spoken meaning \u2013 evoke the perception of specific colours,\" saysBouvet. This is the experience of a woman identified as 'VA' in a 2023 paper co-authored by Bouvet. For instance, every time VA hears a hard \"a\" sound, she sees luminous cyan. Every time she hears \"k\", she sees red.\n\"VA describes a way of thinking in images, where words function as a second language,\" says Bouvet. \"The colours evoked by phonemes help her to access meaning.\" VA's process of communication is to hear the sounds, then see the colours, then translate meaning from those colours.\nThis double translation effort could cause VA to lose track of conversations. \"In rare cases, individuals may find their synaesthesia overwhelming, feeling that their internal experiences interfere with their perception of the external world,\"\u00a0explains Bouvet.\nWhether helpful or not to the synaesthete, research into synaesthesia can help us to understand cognitive processes of language and perception. \"Synaesthesia is an intriguing phenomenon in itself,\" says Bouvet. \"But recent research suggests that it is part of a broader, specific cognitive profile. Identifying this unique cognitive profile may be key to gaining a deeper understanding of synaesthesia.\"\u00a0\nFor me, living life with a mishmash of sensations brings joy. Listening to music is a fully immersive experience. I sink into an ocean of texture, as if I'm under a soft duvet or submersed in cool water. The words of a book are not just inert ink on a page, but bring the story to life as they swirl around me. And language fills the air in a kaleidoscope of colour.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\n--\nCorrection: This article originally stated that Dmitri Nabokov wrote Wednesday Is Indigo Blue.

Ireland overcame Wales in Cardiff and England squeezed past Scotland at Allianz Stadium.\nBBC's Rugby Union Weekly pundits have had their say on who Lions head coach Andy Farrell will be keeping his eye on.\nFormer Lions captain Sam Warburton also gives his thoughts on who should be the squad's captain.\nPick your Lions XV in the comments section below.\nThe Calcutta Cup  - a fixture Scotland fly-half Finn Russell has lit up in recent years - was seen as a perfect opportunity for the two-time Lion to restate his credentials as the starting fly-half.\nRussell, especially in the opening half, looked back to his old self as he helped pick apart England's defence with his wide passing game.\nHowever, Gregor Townsend's side failed to capitalise on their dominance and came up short 16-15, with Russell missing all three kicks he had at goal - including a last-gasp match-winning conversion from the corner.\nDespite kicking at 38% in this year's Six Nations, former Scotland captain John Barclay is not concerned and still backs 32-year-old Russell to start.\n\"I still think Finn Russell [is in pole position],\" Barclay told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\"I am not bothered about his kicking. His kicking last year and across the season for Bath has been great. He is a good kicker.\n\"It was the best he has played in the championship. Look at how he got Scotland's backline moving with his passing game. And his kicking game was good too.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'Russell's goal kicking massively disappointing so far'\nEngland fly-half Fin Smith backed up his player-of-the-match performance in round two with another assured display.\nThe Northampton Saint is 10 years younger than Russell and stepped up to kick a pressure penalty from halfway to continue his bid for a spot as one of Farrell's fly-halves.\nIreland fly-half Sam Prendergast, who recently turned 22, is the least experienced contender and won only his sixth cap in Cardiff.\nIreland remain on course for a Grand Slam after Prendergast, who kicked 17 points, helped guide them through a tricky spell when Garry Ringrose was given a 20-minute red card in the 34th minute.\nA particular standout moment came when he spiralled a 50-22 over the head of replacement Wales fly-half Jarrod Evans.

        "article_text": "At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.\nKetamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.\n\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"\nHe is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.\n\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.\nIn and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024.\nAnd the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System.\nAn anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.\nThe drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.\nAnd thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.\nNow, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.\nBut some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that.\nOne Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.\nThe coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died.\nThose on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"\nAcross Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"\nOnce ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.\nThose who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.\nOne mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.\nLexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.\n\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"\nOne reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.\nIn Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.\nTo feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"\nWhat makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.\nAt lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"\nAnd this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.\n\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.\nHigher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.\nThen there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.\nSome of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.\nThe government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"\nFamilies in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.\nIn response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".\nThere is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.\n\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.\nAnd some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".\nIn the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.\nLexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.\nGetting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.\n\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Kyiv and Washington are close to signing a deal over US access to Ukraine's mineral deposits, a Ukrainian minister says.\nOlga Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said on X that \"negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalised\". \nShe added that \"we are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature\".\nUkraine has been facing growing pressure from the US administration to sign the deal, which has ended up in the centre of the growing rift between the US and Ukrainian presidents.\nZelensky first included the offer of an agreement on minerals in the so-called \"victory plan\" that he presented to Trump last September.\nThe idea was to offer the then presidential candidate a tangible reason for the US to continue supporting Ukraine.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson told the BBC in Kyiv that such a deal was \"the great prize\" because it would secure \"a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.  This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral.\nGraphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine's global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nOn Monday, ahead of a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told US news outlet NewsNation that the deal was \"about growing the pie economically and binding the US and Ukraine together for the future\". \nPrior to Stefanishyna's assertion that a deal was close, there appeared to be several sticking points.\nLast Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a reported 50% share of its rare earth minerals - which Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.\n\"I can't sell our state,\" he said.\nThe provisions of a second draft of the deal on Sunday appeared to be even tougher than in the first document.\nInstead of 50/50 revenue split, the revised draft suggested the US wanted full control, Zelensky told journalists at the press conference on Sunday.\nTrump said earlier this month that the US military and economic aid to Ukraine amounts to about $500bn (\u00a3396bn), and he wants the US to have access to Ukrainian minerals of that value.\nHowever, Zelensky has said that the American assistance so far totals around $100bn (\u00a379bn). Kyiv has also insisted that the aid they have received until now was a grant and not a credit, and so Ukraine has no obligation to return anything.\nZelenzky is also said to want any deal to include security guarantees.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson called an agreement for US access to Ukraine's minerals \"the great prize\".\nHe rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\" but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argued that if they can attract American investors to develop their natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to offering the US access to Russia's rare minerals, in order to counter a potential deal between the US and Ukraine.\nIn a televised interview on Russian state-owned broadcaster Rossiya 1, he said it would include access to Russia's \"new territories\" - those it has seized and occupied in Ukraine since their invasion three years ago.\n\"We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine,\" Putin said, adding Russia was ready to \"attract foreign partners\".",

This posture is a dramatic shift from American ideals of freedom and democracy,\" he wrote on X.  \nThe vote was \"contrary to our long-standing support of democracy\", said former US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \nUkraine's former minister of economy, Tymofiy Mylovanov, said the choice to side with Russia was deliberate. \n\"This is no longer just rhetoric or political theatre,\" he said. \nAt the much more powerful 15-member UN Security Council, the unamended US resolution - which called for an end to the conflict but contained no criticism of Russia - was passed by 10 votes, with the UK, France, Denmark, Greece and Slovenia abstaining.\nAmerica's acting envoy to the UN, Dorothy Camille Shea, described the US resolution as a \"simple historic statement... that looks forward, not backwards. A resolution focused on one simple idea: ending the war\".\nRarely has the US been so at odds with its supposed European allies.    \nSince Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, the Security Council has been deadlocked by the power of Russia, one of its five permanent members, to veto any resolution there.\nFor this reason the UNGA has been the main forum for debating the war.

It turned a good night for the Australian into a great one.\nFor Inglis, Australia's match-winner who was born and raised in Yorkshire, supports the Sky Blues.\nThe 29-year-old lived on the outskirts of Leeds until he was 14, played for Yorkshire's youth teams and when named Sportsman of the Year at St Mary's Comprehensive in Menston, was presented with an award by the Kaiser Chiefs - the famous musical sons of the West Yorkshire city.\nInglis even admitted to still supporting England as recently as 2017 while trying to win a place in Australia's XI.\n\"Those days are long gone, I think,\" said the right-hander, shortly after his innings propelled Australia to the highest run-chase in the 50-year history of cricket's global white-ball events.\nA 13-year-old Josh Inglis received an award for outstanding sporting achievement from the Kaiser Chiefs in his school days on the outskirts of Bradford\nInglis moved to Western Australia as a 15-year-old when his England-born mum, Sarah, and father, Martin, who was born in Coventry hence the football allegiance, moved the family down under. Any hint of a Yorkshire twang was left on t' plane.\nHe now speaks with a broad Australian accent, has a thick moustache and addressed the media with his cap backwards and sliders on his feet.\nThere were no split loyalties during his stunning assault.\nAustralia were 136-4 when Inglis began - England overwhelming favourites with Adil Rashid, Inglis' former Yorkshire second XI team-mate, spinning a web.\nHe began by timing the ball to all corners of Lahore before flogging England's bowlers whenever they dropped too short. By the end, he was playing the trademark shot of another Yorkshireman - Joe Root - with a reverse scoop over the third man rope.\nIt meant a chase of 352, the ninth-highest in one-day international history, was completed with 15 balls to spare.\nInglis has flickered in international cricket but the past month has been his breakout moment. He scored a Test century on debut last month but ranks this as his greatest day.\n\"It was really special,\" Inglis said. \"Under the circumstances, in an ICC [International Cricket Council] event, you want to have an impact and win a game.\"\nFor much of Saturday it looked like Ben Duckett who had landed the warning shots before this winter's Ashes, followed by Jofra Archer and Mark Wood with their dismissals of Travis Head and Steve Smith.\nIt may in fact be Inglis who has done the most to aid his cause of striding out at Perth on 21 November.\nFor the side Inglis used to support, talk of the Ashes must wait. There were no clouds in Lahore, but for England - beaten in 11 of their past 15 matches - it still poured.\nThis was the day their batting finally clicked \u2013 the highest score in Champions Trophy reached, only for a player born in their heartlands to better it. Sometimes you can only smile.\n\"I just think, you've got to sometimes credit the opposition,\" said a phlegmatic captain Jos Buttler. \"I thought Josh Inglis played a fantastic innings.\"\nThis time, it is hard to argue.\nThis video can not be played\n'Oh no!' - Archer drops sitter to gift Carey half-century\nIn making a superb 165, Duckett played how most have requested. The attacking intent was reined in, gaps worked and a score steadily built rather than thrown up in a hurry.\nEngland's top order has been asked to score hundreds \u2013 to overcome their tendency to start well and depart - and Duckett produced England's highest score in a Champions Trophy or World Cup.\nTheir score of 351-8 was the highest at a Champions Trophy. Another 30 may not have mattered the way Inglis was going.\nIn truth, England's biggest failure on this occasion was not made in Lahore on Saturday but before Christmas in London \u2013 or at least after Jacob Bethell pulled a hamstring in Nagpur.\nTheir squad has four wicketkeepers, one specialist spinner and one batting all-rounder, meaning England will always lose their fight in search of the perfect balance.\nWith four frontline bowlers against Australia, Buttler had nowhere to turn when Brydon Carse had his most difficult day to date in an England shirt \u2013 even if Liam Livingstone and Joe Root performed admirably as the fifth bowler.\nIt leaves a feeling that Bethell's injury was more damaging to England than it first appeared, given his left-arm spin would have provided another option.\nWithout him Buttler now faces a defining week in his reign as England's white-ball captain.\nAfter a dismal defence of their 50-over world title in 2023 and an uninspired attempt at retaining their T20 crown last year, he cannot afford a group-stage exit here.\nMatthew Mott was dispensable enough to take the fall for the previous failures but Brendon McCullum, given the keys to all England sides to mould as he pleases until 2027, is not. Instead, it will be Buttler in the firing line if this group stage is not turned around.\nNext is Afghanistan in four days' time \u2013 a side who beat England during the World Cup 16 months ago \u2013 and then South Africa, some people's favourite for the title, with wins likely to be needed in both.\nEngland have questions again and some do not have an easy answer.

Here, she shares the best samba experiences in Rio, from traditional school events to samba circles.\nBrazilians often say that \"everything ends in samba\", but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that samba never ends \u2013 at least not in Rio de Janeiro, one of the places where the musical and dance genre is said to have originated. Aside from providing entertainment, samba has played a crucial role in shaping Rio's lifestyle, including taking a central role in its Carnival celebration \u2013 the most renowned in the world.\nMore than just a genre, samba is a cultural phenomenon that helps drive the economy, with more than 150 official rodas de samba (samba circles) across the city. At these lively gatherings, musicians sit in a circle while crowds of hundreds \u2013 or even thousands \u2013 of spectators sing along, creating an electrifying atmosphere. Meanwhile, escolas de samba (community-based \"samba schools\" that organise the world-famous Carnival parade with its giant floats and thrilling costumes) elect a rainha da bateria (queen of the drums) who leads the school's bateria (drum section), captivating the crowd and forging a powerful connection between the musicians and the audience.\nThe SpeciaList\nMayara Lima is one of Rio's most popular samba queens, having claimed the title of drum queen in 2023. She currently represents the Para\u00edso do Tuiuti samba school, where she gained national recognition for her mesmerising samba style.\nBut the energy of samba can be felt in Rio all year round. Even outside Carnival season, events like samba school street rehearsals offer a vibrant and immersive experience. We asked\u00a0Mayara Lima, a rainha de bateria (drum queen) at Parara\u00edso do Tuiti, one of Rio's most renowned samba schools, how to experience the city's rich samba culture during Carnival and beyond.\nLima knew from an early age that dance was her calling, and she joined a samba school at age 10. \"I had studied other rhythms, such as ballet and jazz, but I decided to be fully dedicated to samba,\" she says.\nLima is a proud carioca \u2013 a Rio native. \"To me, Rio is far more than just a city,\" she says. \"What makes Rio so unique is the way it combines breathtaking natural beauty \u2013 its beaches and trails \u2013 with the energy of a vibrant, urban metropolis, where every neighbourhood has its own distinct charm and history.\" She adds: \"[But] you can't talk about Rio without talking about samba, can you? Their histories are intertwined.\"\nAhead of the 2025 Carnival, which runs from 28 February to 8 March, here are five of Lima's favorite samba experiences in Rio.\nRio's samba school parade is a global spectacle every Carnival season. Of the more than 70 samba schools, only a select few belong to the elite group that takes centre stage, parading down the Samb\u00f3dromo Marqu\u00eas de Sapuca\u00ed during the festivities \u2013 but the schools promote several events during the year that take place in the quadras (samba school headquarters), which play a key role in strengthening ties between the schools and the local community.\nTip:\nRio's music scene is about more than just samba. \"Baile Charme, an old-school R&B event, under the Madureira viaduct every Saturday [starts] at 20:00 and ends at the sunrise at 05:00,\" says Lima. This event has been going strong for over 20 years and remains a huge success, attracting thousands of people every week. \"It's a great way to see another side of Rio's music scene.\"\nCariocas and visitors of all ages come to samba schools to watch rehearsals, participate in feijoadas (a traditional feast of black beans and pork) and enjoy live performances of the school's samba anthem; a new one is chosen each year to serve as the narrative musical thread for each performance.\n\"There are 12 main samba schools [in Rio], which means 12 opportunities to experience samba,\" says Lima. \"While there's no fixed schedule for events, something is always happening. Each school hosts feijoadas several times a year. They feature guest performers playing not just samba, but also pagode [a type of samba/subgenre of samba] and carioca funk.\"\nFor Lima, the Gr\u00eamio Recreativo Escola de Samba Acad\u00eamicos do Salgueiro samba school holds one of Rio's best feijoadas. \"It's a thrilling event, it often happens in the first Monday of each month,\" she says. But her favourite type of samba school event is undoubtedly street rehearsals. \"As Carnival approaches, we hold street rehearsals every Monday in front of the samba school before heading inside to continue practicing,\" she says. \"It's amazing!\"\nEach school announces its events on social media. Street rehearsals are free, but other events, such as feijoada feast and samba circles, usually require a ticket.\u00a0\nWebsite: www.salgueiro.com.br\nAddress: R. Silva Teles, 104 - Andara\u00ed\nPhone: +552238-9226\nInstagram: @salgueirooriginal\n\u00a0\nPedra do Sal \u2013 a sloping set of stone steps found in Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, known as Rio's \"Little Africa\" \u2013 is believed to have been the birthplace of samba in the early 20th Century. When the area served as a market for enslaved people and the unloading point for salt (sal in Portuguese) shipments, it also became a gathering place for enslaved Africans, who came together to honour their deities and play the instruments that became part of samba's DNA, like the pandeiro (tambourine).\nDuring the day, Pedra do Sal's rich history attracts small groups of tourists eager to understand Rio's past. But as the sun sets, the streets fill with vendors and hundreds of visitors drawn to the city's most famous roda de samba.\nOnce held only on Monday nights, the event grew so popular that organisers expanded it to four nights a week, from Friday to Monday \u2013 though Monday remains the busiest night. The music spills over Pedra do Sal's famous steps, creating an electrifying, open-air celebration.\n\"Pedra do Sal attracts such a diverse crowd \u2013 you'll find people from all over the city, from different backgrounds, and loads of tourists too,\" says Lima. \"It's a great mix, and that reflects in the music. Samba is the essence, but you'll hear other rhythms too.\"\nAddress: Rua Argemiro Bulc\u00e3o, s/n, Sa\u00fade,\nInstagram: @pedradosaloficial\nIn the city's northern zone, 21km from the historic Copacabana beach, hundreds of samba enthusiasts gather at the Pagode do Chinelo roda in the Pilares borough, right next to the renowned samba school Caprichosos de Pilares.\nLike most rodas de samba, the gathering started with modest expectations \u2013 just a group of friends meeting every Monday for a cold beer and some samba \u2013 but the samba do Chinelo quickly became a sensation and is now one of Rio\u2019s official rodas de samba, attracting locals and celebrities alike, and has since evolved into a professionally structured event.\n\"This is one of those places everyone goes to. It's a given that it'll be packed every Monday, with plenty of famous faces in the crowd. Sometimes you even see singers like [Grammy winner] Ludmilla performing \u2013 it's really cool,\" says Lima.\nThe event kicks off at 18:00 and carries on into the late night. Pagode do Chinelo is also the perfect spot to experience different samba styles. \"It's a great place to enjoy a more melodic samba, which is slower, or samba partido-alto, which is faster and more upbeat. It's brilliant fun,\" says Lima.\nAddress: Rua Faleiros, 1, Pilares\nInstagram: @resenhapagodeechinelo\n4. Best for experiencing classic samba: Cacique de Ramos\u00a0\nThe northern zone of the city is also home to one of Rio's most traditional rodas de samba.\nTip:\nFor those looking for a more laid-back way to explore Rio, Lima recommends having breakfast inside the Jardim Bot\u00e2nico. \"Some of the cafes in the garden allow you to enjoy a morning meal surrounded by nature overlooking century-old trees,\" she says \"It\u2019s the perfect place to start your day in a relaxing atmosphere before exploring the city's other attractions.\"\nFounded in the 1960s, Cacique de Ramos became famous for its legendary samba gatherings, where some of the genre's most celebrated artists first rose to prominence. Often described as the \"headquarters of samba\", it has played a pivotal role in shaping Rio's Carnival culture.\n\"This is where you'll find classic samba,\" says Lima. \"Cacique de Ramos is the birthplace of many greats, including Arlindo Cruz, Zeca Pagodinho and Beth Carvalho. If you want to experience that unique energy, this is the place to go.\"\nThe samba takes place every Sunday in Cacique de Ramos samba hall, making it an ideal option for those looking to enjoy a lively evening without a late finish. \"Since it's on a Sunday, Cacique de Ramos wraps up around midnight,\" says Lima. \"So if you need to be up early the next day but still want to make the most of your weekend, it's perfect. It's definitely one of my favourites.\"\nWebsite: www.caciquederamos.com.br\nAddress: Rua Uranos, 1326 - Olaria\nPhone: +55213251-4374\nInstagram: @cacique_de_ramos\nBar\u00f3dromo is a well-known samba venue among cariocas and a favourite gathering spot for samba enthusiasts. The walls are adorned with Carnival costumes and masks, immersing guests in the samba atmosphere the moment they step inside.\n\"It's always buzzing, absolutely packed,\" says Lima. \"It's a bar with a proper traditional samba roda, where people clap along to the beat \u2013 it's such a great vibe. The whole place is dedicated to samba, and that's what makes it so special.\"\nThe venue is open from Tuesday to Sunday, with samba sessions every night, ranging from performances of traditional samba to live sets from samba school baterias.\nBar\u00f3dromo is a popular venue that frequently fills to capacity, occasionally leading to slower service. However, the lively atmosphere and infectious energy of the crowd create a fully immersive experience, with the music at its heart.\nAddress: Rua Dona Zulmira, 41 - Maracan\u00e3\nInstagram: @barodromo\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

This is a playbook that many leaders around the world now see as more productive than outright plain speaking or criticism of Trump.\nMacron managed to navigate what could have been a tricky day in Washington without conceding or revealing too much. \nHe spoke of both countries wanting peace, and while he gently corrected one of Trump's claims on Europe's support for Ukraine, he also agreed that Europe needed to take more responsibility for its own security.\nBut Macron did make one important concession \u2013 that Trump was right to re-establish some kind of relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin.\nThat is in sharp contrast to the view up until now in London, Paris and Berlin, which have all pursued a policy of isolating Putin and slapping sanctions on Russian industries and individuals.\n\"There is good reason for President Trump to re-engage with President Putin,\" Macron said, adding that the new administration represented \"a big change\".\nMacron held out the prospect of European countries such as France and the UK being willing to play a leading role in ensuring the security of a post-truce Ukraine, possibly in the form of air power and troops stationed away from the frontline.\nBut at the same time, he stressed the importance of having an American backstop.\nMacron, however, did not get a commitment of US back-up from his meeting in the Oval Office.

        "article_text": "Kyiv and Washington are close to signing a deal over US access to Ukraine's mineral deposits, a Ukrainian minister says.\nOlga Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said on X that \"negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalised\". \nShe added that \"we are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature\".\nUkraine has been facing growing pressure from the US administration to sign the deal, which has ended up in the centre of the growing rift between the US and Ukrainian presidents.\nZelensky first included the offer of an agreement on minerals in the so-called \"victory plan\" that he presented to Trump last September.\nThe idea was to offer the then presidential candidate a tangible reason for the US to continue supporting Ukraine.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson told the BBC in Kyiv that such a deal was \"the great prize\" because it would secure \"a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.  This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral.\nGraphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries. And prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine's global share of titanium production, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations, was 7%.\nFurther, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.\nSome of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nIn 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, and half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.\nDr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.\nCritical minerals \"are the foundation of the 21st Century economy\", Dr Muggah explained. They are key to renewable energy, military applications and industrial infrastructure and play \"a growing strategic role in geopolitics and geoeconomics\", he said.\nAdditionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.\nIn December China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.\nOn Monday, ahead of a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told US news outlet NewsNation that the deal was \"about growing the pie economically and binding the US and Ukraine together for the future\". \nPrior to Stefanishyna's assertion that a deal was close, there appeared to be several sticking points.\nLast Wednesday, Zelensky rejected US demands for a reported 50% share of its rare earth minerals - which Trump said would reflect the amount of aid the US had provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.\n\"I can't sell our state,\" he said.\nThe provisions of a second draft of the deal on Sunday appeared to be even tougher than in the first document.\nInstead of 50/50 revenue split, the revised draft suggested the US wanted full control, Zelensky told journalists at the press conference on Sunday.\nTrump said earlier this month that the US military and economic aid to Ukraine amounts to about $500bn (\u00a3396bn), and he wants the US to have access to Ukrainian minerals of that value.\nHowever, Zelensky has said that the American assistance so far totals around $100bn (\u00a379bn). Kyiv has also insisted that the aid they have received until now was a grant and not a credit, and so Ukraine has no obligation to return anything.\nZelenzky is also said to want any deal to include security guarantees.\nOn Monday former UK prime minister Boris Johnson called an agreement for US access to Ukraine's minerals \"the great prize\".\nHe rejected suggestions the deal was a \"rip-off\" and said \"what the Ukrainians get from this is a United States commitment under Donald Trump to a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nSome commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\" but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.\nDeveloping these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine. \nShe argued that if they can attract American investors to develop their natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.\n\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\"\nOn Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to offering the US access to Russia's rare minerals, in order to counter a potential deal between the US and Ukraine.\nIn a televised interview on Russian state-owned broadcaster Rossiya 1, he said it would include access to Russia's \"new territories\" - those it has seized and occupied in Ukraine since their invasion three years ago.\n\"We undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine,\" Putin said, adding Russia was ready to \"attract foreign partners\".",

        "article_text": "Rorschach tests play with the human imagination and our mind's ability to impart meaning onto the world around us \u2013 but what does AI see in them?\nFor more than a century, the Rorschach inkblot test has been widely used as a window into people's personality.\nEven if you haven't done one yourself, you'll recognise the mirrored ink smudges that form ambiguous shapes on cards. Developed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in 1921, the test involves showing a number of inkblots to subjects, then asking them to say what they see. The images are deliberately inscrutable and open to interpretation.\nFor decades they were popular among psychologists as a way of understanding a person's psyche from the creatures, objects or scenes they perceive in the shapes. It relies upon a phenomenon known as pareidolia, which is a tendency to find meaningful interpretations in things where there is none. It is the same reason why people see faces or animals in cloud formations or on the surface of the Moon.\nYou might see a butterfly in the image while someone else might see a skull. According to proponents of the test, both interpretations shed light on how you think.\nWhile many psychologists today believe the test is now obsolete and has little credibility as a psychometric tool, it is still used in some parts of the world and is even used as part of courtroom evidence, although this is controversial. Rorschach never intended it to be a measure of personality, but rather a way of identifying disordered thinking in patients, such as those with schizophrenia. Some psychologists, however, still believe it is useful as a tool in therapy as a way of encouraging self-reflection or starting conversations.\n\"When a person interprets a\u00a0Rorschach\u00a0image, they unconsciously project elements of their psyche such as fears, desires, and cognitive biases,\" says Barbara Santini, a London-based psychologist, who uses the Rorschach test with her clients. \"The test works because human vision isn't passive, but a meaning-making process shaped by personal experience.\"\nFinding meaning or familiar shapes in inkblots relies upon a number of cognitive processes that humans use every day, including memory, emotion and the ability to deal with ambiguity.\nBut what happens if you have no personal experience, or you offer it to a \"brain\" that works in an entirely different way? What might an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm recognise in these inkblots? And what would their answers tell us about the human mind?\nRecent developments in the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT means it's now possible to put that to the test. So-called \"multimodal models\" can accept image-based inputs and provide responses as easily as they are to interact with text-based prompts thanks to their machine vision capabilities.\nWe gave ChatGPT five of the 10 common images used in an inkblot test to see how it would interpret the images. But the AI system's training data \u2013 information that helps establish its \"knowledge\", makes it trickier to do so.\nAI v the Mind\nThis article is part of\u202fAI v the Mind, a series that aims to explore the limits of cutting-edge AI and learn a little about how our own brains work along the way. With some expert help, each article pits different AI tools against the human mind, asking probing questions designed to test the limits of intelligence. Can a machine write a better joke than a professional comedian, or unpick a moral conundrum more elegantly than a philosopher? We hope to find out.\u00a0\nShowing the AI model the first inkblot card from an online database of inkblots, which is commonly interpreted by humans as a bat, butterfly or moth, highlighted just how literal AI vision algorithms can be.\n\"This image is a Rorschach inkblot, often used in psychological assessments to explore perception and interpretation,\" the chatbot replied. \"It is designed to be ambiguous so that each person might see something different depending on their experiences, emotions, and imagination.\"\nPretence spoiled, it then went on to explain what it saw in the same answer, without me having to prompt it further. \"For me, it resembles something symmetrical, possibly two animals or figures facing each other, or a single entity with wings outstretched,\" the chatbot responded. \"The beauty of these inkblots is that they invite individual interpretations!\"\nThe chatbot then asked me back what I saw in the image \u2013 a question I chose to ignore, instead pressing it to see which of the two resemblances it had suggested it thought was most fitting. \"Looking closely, I'd say it most resembles a single entity with wings outstretched \u2013 perhaps a bat or a moth, with its wings open symmetrically,\" the chatbot wrote. \"The central area could be interpreted as the body, and the details on the sides evoke the texture or shape of wings.\"\n\"I think that's just rehearsing what it knows of the specific test,\" says Coen Dekker, a Dutch software developer who a decade ago asked a neural network, an early version of the technology underpinning AI chatbots today, to complete a Rorschach test. (Dekker's experiment was significantly more simplified because of the technical constraints of the neural networks of the time.)\u00a0\n\"I believe it mainly identifies patterns, shapes, and textures within the blots, and then compares these features to a vast dataset of human responses to generate its interpretation of what it sees in the inkblots,\" says Ieva Kubiliute, a London-based psychologist.\n\"ChatGPT provides interesting, human-like responses, but it is likely not genuinely thinking \u2013 instead, it appears to be scanning an online dataset,\" says Chandril Ghosh, lecturer in psychology at the University of Kent, in the UK, specialising in mental health, AI and treatment. It's similar to the way a musician who has never experienced heartbreak can still write a song that pulls at your heartstrings, simply by analysing how other similar songs like it are structured. Or as Santini, the psychologist puts it, \"If an AI's response resembles a human's, it's not because it sees the same thing but it's because its training data mirrors our collective visual culture.\"\nWhat we get is a facsimile of reality \u2013 and of thought. \"ChatGPT can accurately describe emotions without actually experiencing them,\" Ghosh says. That doesn't make AI useless when it comes to matters of the mind, however. \"ChatGPT can understand emotions, describe them, and help others make sense of their feelings,\" he says.\nGhosh believes that ChatGPT is simply regurgitating random information from its dataset for the benefit of users \u2013 which gives the impression of \"thinking\", but never actually is. Part of the reason why we perceive it possibly as thinking is the way that the tech companies behind these AI chatbots present their products. ChatGPT and tools like it are always helpful, always conscientious, and always conversational. The anthropomorphising of these tools has helped their adoption \u2013 but it can muddy the waters around how they \u2013 and their outputs \u2013 are perceived.\nOne way of uncovering that unreality is by simply pressing the refresh button, says Ghosh. Present ChatGPT with the same inkblot image to analyse, and it may well come up with a totally different interpretation in the same conversation.\nWhen we gave ChatGPT the same image twice, the AI did indeed give different responses.\n\"A human would typically stick to their previous answer because personal experiences and emotions influence their responses,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, ChatGPT generates responses based on its dataset.\"\nThat's part of the problem when trying to infer meaning in what ChatGPT says about the inkblots it sees: the chatbot is simply regurgitating what its training data has encountered.\nThis is perhaps best demonstrated by an experiment by researchers at the MediaLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US. They trained an AI algorithm called \"Norman\" \u2013 named after Alfred Hitchcock's character Norman Bates \u2013 on images from a Reddit group that shares images of people dying in gruesome circumstances. When they showed Norman a set of Rorschach inkblots, the images it described seeing reflected the darkness it had been trained upon. While an algorithm trained on a more normal set of image data would see a group of birds on a tree branch, Norman described seeing a man being electrocuted.\nIt is a stark illustration of just how important the data used to train an AI can be. Train a model using bad data, and the resulting AI will reflect the flaws in that data.\nBut what an AI chooses to regurgitate in response to ambiguous stimuli is interesting, says Dekker \u2013 in part because of what it says, rather than what it \"knows\" (AI systems know nothing innately). \"It has a general understanding of colour theory and what emotional responses these could give when analysed,\" says Dekker. \"I have a feeling it has a general understanding of the images and what people associate it with. This got me thinking: Wouldn't it be cool if we had \u2013 or created \u2013 a new set of Rorschach-like images which the model does not know about at all, and let it analyse those?\"\nWhile this isn't something Dekker is actively pursuing, we know that AI algorithms do have a tendency to \"hallucinate\" and invent information that isn't true. But it is also possible force them to hallucinate too. In one experiment by computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, US, they were able to 3D print a turtle with a particular colour and texture that fooled a machine vision system into thinking it was a rifle. Similarly, a few stickers on a stop sign can render it invisible to the algorithm \u2013 a potential risk for a self-driving car. (Read more about the 'weird events' that make machines hallucinate.)\nAI algorithms are particularly good at spotting patterns, but those differing responses to a single ambiguous image also highlight an aspect of the human mind that AI can't replicate: the emotions and unconscious meanings we attach to things we encounter in the world around us. There was no subjectivity in what the AI system was saying when presented with the inkblots, Kubiliute says. \"It cannot understand the symbolic meaning or emotional resonance that a human might associate with a particular image.\"\nAnd that in itself tells us a lot about the human mind. \"The human psyche is filled with internal conflicts, such as the tension between desires and morals or fears and ambitions,\" says Ghosh. \"In contrast, AI functions on clear logic and does not struggle with inner dilemmas essential to human thought and decision-making.\"\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Amanda Pritchard, the first female chief executive of the NHS in England, is stepping down from the role. \nIn a statement Ms Pritchard said it had been a \"hugely difficult decision for me to stand down\".\n\"It has been an enormous privilege to lead the NHS in England through what has undoubtedly been the most difficult period in its history.\"\nShe took up the post in 2021 and played a central role in the official response to the Covid pandemic.\nBefore that, she was NHS England's chief operating officer, head of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust in London and an adviser in Tony Blair's government.\nHer departure comes less than a month after two influential House of Commons committees discussed her suitability to lead the NHS through a period of what Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said will be the biggest overhaul of the service.\nAs to the timing of her resignation, some words in her letter are significant. \nShe noted that there is due to be radical reform of the size and functions of NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care to \"drive the government's reform priorities\" and that the \"step change required\" would be best served by new leadership.\nSources have indicated that the government wants to bind NHS England closer to the Department of Health to push ahead with changes, including shifting the focus from hospitals to community care. \nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting may well have felt the need to find a new leader, and Amanda Pritchard possibly felt that after several years at NHS England she did not want to be on a tighter rein.\nAmanda Pritchard joined NHS England in 2019 as number two to the then chief executive Sir Simon, now Lord Stevens. Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government. \u00a0\n\"Wes Streeting is entitled to shape things as he wishes\", said one, \"but the role of NHS England chief executive will change\".\nThe reality is that whoever is appointed, the government faces huge challenges cutting waiting lists for operations and treatments, and reducing long waits in emergency departments.\nNHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.\nMs Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.\nHe said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\"\nRichard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS.\n\"Under her leadership, the NHS has delivered a huge amount for patients - in the face of pandemic recovery, unprecedented strikes and consecutive even busier winter periods, the NHS has continued to improve performance, reform and innovate\", he said.\nMs Pritchard has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.\nThe public accounts committee said that she, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and two senior civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care were \"complacent\" and lacked dynamism.\nMPs on the Health and Social Care Committee said they were disappointed and frustrated by the \"lengthy and diffuse answers\" she and other officials gave them under questioning.\nLast week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\"\nNHS England has announced that Sir James Mackey, currently chief executive of Newcastle Hospitals, will be taking over as interim head of NHS England and will work closely with Ms Pritchard for the next month before taking up post formally in April.\nHer successor, Sir James, said he was honoured to be leading the health service through the next phase \"as we radically reshape the role of NHS England and work with the government to build an NHS that is fit for the future through the 10-year health plan\".",

I didn't know how to deal with my emotions. It really affected my mental health and I had suicidal thoughts.\n\"Now I've learned to ignore the comments and if I can be bothered, I delete them.\"\nOfcom has previously issued guidance to tech firms around protections for children online and on dealing with illegal online content.\nSpeaking to Radio 5 Live, Dame Melanie said the organisation would \"absolutely\" name and shame companies who didn't comply with their guidance, so the public would know which companies were \"not taking [user's safety] seriously\".\nThe regulator wants sites and apps to adopt these measures voluntarily in what they call \"a safety by design approach\". For example, they could adopt \"abusability\" testing to identify how a service or feature could be exploited by a malicious user.\nRules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force this year, will compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide. The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography.\nContent creator Harriet Maynard has also experienced abusive comments, which sometimes escalate into pile-ons - where a large number of people harass a person online.\nHer Instagram posts are aimed at a female audience and relate to issues around parenthood and lifestyle content.\nDespite having mainly female followers, when a video of Harriet's goes viral, she says she receives \"an influx of negative messages, primarily from men\".\n\"I normally don't let it bother me, but when you get a wave of online abuse, it can get you down.\n\"In a 'normal' workplace, if you were being bullied or harassed, then there'd be an HR department to deal with it accordingly. But for us making content online for a living, there's nothing like that.\"\nNicole Jacobs, domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, welcomes the draft guidance.\n\"I'm pleased that Ofcom are stepping up to start the process of providing guidance to tech companies to tackle this,\" she said. \"It's now on these firms to implement these recommendations and ensure that perpetrators can no longer weaponise online platforms for harm.\n\"By taking meaningful practical action, not only will people be safer online, but it will demonstrate that tech companies are ready to play their part in tackling domestic abuse.\"\nProf Clare McGlynn, an expert in sexual violence, online abuse and the legal regulation of pornography, says she feels the guidance, which has no legal force, will struggle to make meaningful change.\n\"Experience shows that tech platforms do the absolute minimum necessary to comply with the law and little more. In the current climate, this is unlikely to change,\" she said.\n\"We urgently need to do more by strengthening regulation, making many of these recommendations legally binding. A dedicated Online Safety Commission which prioritises online harms would be a positive next step. \"\nSome of the suggestions to tech companies from Ofcom include:\nWhile a report from Ofcom shows women are five times more likely to suffer intimate image abuse and are more likely to report being negatively affected by harms experienced online than men, Dame Melanie said the guidance was not about \"women versus men or demonising men\".\n\"I think many men are really concerned about this as well. And that wider culture that's going on online, I just don't think it's healthy for anybody.\n\"The misogyny that's becoming normalised in some parts of the internet, that's not great for boys. It's not going to help them to form proper, strong, healthy relationships as they grow up. So I really hope men will get involved in this too.\"\nHarriet believes some of the suggestions by Ofcom would be ineffectual, such as popups on screen to make users consider if they wish to post abusive comments.\n\"I don't think these kind of people worry if they're going to offend someone by doing what they're doing. They hide behind their keypads. Complete cowards,\" she says.\nHowever, she would welcome more protections for women experiencing pile-ons if they were built into social media platforms, adding users should be able to protect themselves from \"pure abuse\".\nMiah feels the guidance may make some difference, if companies choose to follow it.\n\"I'd like to see tech companies do more,\" she says, \"[Ofcom has] a huge challenge, but real change is possible if they hold platforms accountable.\n\"Right now, reporting hate often leads nowhere - there needs to be stricter enforcement and actual consequences for harmful behaviour.\"\nIn a statement given to the BBC, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, said: \"We remove any language that incites or facilitates serious violence, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe that there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.\n\"We continue to work with women's safety groups to understand the different ways harassment towards women can show up, while improving our technology to find and remove abuse more quickly.\"\nThe BBC has also contacted other social media companies, including TikTok and X, for comment.\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article, help and support can be found on the BBC action line website.\nRadio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell is being joined by a panel of experts and a studio audience to discuss women and girls' safety online, in public spaces and at home.

        "article_text": "The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan's civil war, the BBC has learned.\nAid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut.\nIt is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected.\nThe conflict between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023.\nThe kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods.\n\"People are knocking on the volunteers' doors,\" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. \"People are screaming from hunger in the streets.\"\nThe Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was \"serving US interests\", and moved to begin dismantling USAID.\nThe State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice.\nThe normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance \u2013 on which the communal kitchens depend \u2013 will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes.\nThe closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations.\nThe network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country's civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID.\nIt's a \"huge setback\" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who's set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms.\nThe former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN.\nMoney had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works.\n\"It was ground-breaking,\" says Ms Tracy. \"The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets (humanitarian group) in Syria.\"\nFor Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out.\nThere was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege.\nMost of the kitchens have closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon \"we expect to see a lot of people starving\".\nHere and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy's Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID.\n\"I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],\" she said, \"but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it's never going to be what it was.\"\n\"These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,\" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation.\nThey are \"exhausted, traumatised and underfunded\" and \"we were scaling up to help them\".\nThe State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful.\n\"The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,\" it said in response to a BBC query.\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances.\nIn 2024 the United States was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan.\nTop UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington's policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries.\n\"I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,\" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP's assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month.\nThe influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further.\n\"We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,\" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' regional bureau director.\nHe had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. \"We are strained. It's extremely difficult.\"\nThey both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, \"it is a million extra people who've come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger\", says Ms Dagesh.\nMost families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority.\n\"But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,\" she said.\nMost of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people.\nThey say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing.\nFaced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape.\nMany of the refugees she met had come from Sudan's agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods.\nThey would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight.\nWith the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders.\nYet aid agencies that normally would help are strained. \nThe UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise \"to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum\".\nIt does not help that the agency was already underfunded. \nThe UNHCR's call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut \"everything\", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive.\nThe US has been the UNHCR's main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo. \n\"We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,\" Mr Balde told the BBC.\nFaced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on \"very dangerous journeys\", says Mr Balde.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Imagine waking up in Rome 2,000 years ago, on the Nile in ancient Egypt or on the streets of London during the Black Death in the 1300s - complete with realistic sights, sounds and daily struggles.\nIn recent weeks, AI-generated videos showing the points of view of people waking up in different historical time periods have gone viral on TikTok.\nDan and Hogne are the creators behind two of the accounts - POV Lab and Time Traveller POV. \nDan, based in the UK, tells the BBC he creates these videos as the \"idea of seeing the past through a first-person perspective felt like a unique way to bring history to life\". \nHogne, a 27-year-old from Norway, adds that his videos are teaching people \"about cool parts of history and helping them learn something new\".\nDespite the videos offering millions a window into history, a number of historians have shared concerns about the accuracy of the content and whether AI can truly resurrect the past, or are we just seeing a polished, modernised version of history designed for engagement?\nMurky and misty streets, coughing townsfolk, and the distant toll of a plague doctor's bell all feature in Hogne's most-watched video, which has racked up 53 million views.\nIt has sparked fascination among many, but historian Dr Amy Boyington describes the medieval-themed video as \"amateurish\" and \"evocative and sensational\" rather than historically accurate.\n\"It looks like something from a video game as it shows a world that is meant to look real but is actually fake.\"\nShe points out inaccuracies like the depiction of houses with large glazed windows and a train track running through the town which wouldn't have existed in the 1300s. \nHistorian and archaeologist Dr Hannah Platts has also noticed significant inaccuracies in a video depicting the eruption of Mount Vesuvius at Pompeii.\n\"Due to Pliny the Younger's eyewitness account of the eruption, we know that it didn't start with lava spewing everywhere so to not use that wealth of historical information available to us feels cheap and lazy.\"\nShe also spots smaller mistakes - stemmed wine glasses and pepper mills didn't exist and people would be reclining while eating not sitting on dining chairs. \n\"The bread roll in the video is a modern loaf and given we actually have carbonised loaves from the time it's a real shame the person making the video didn't do some research and include that.\" \nDan, who created the video of Pompeii, says he recognises a lots of details in his videos are historically inaccurate.\n\"AI-generated content isn't perfect, and while I strive for accuracy, these videos are more about evoking the feeling of a time period rather than being a 100% factual recreation. \n\"They're more like artistic interpretations rather than strict documentaries.\"\nBut, Dr Boyington worries about the impact that these artistic interpretations can have on rewriting history.\n\"It can be quite dangerous as people could manipulate history - for example, someone could create an AI-generated video that backs up holocaust deniers.\"\nWhile most people will know that the content of the video isn't real, the concern is for \"young people who will learn about a historical time period for the first time through these videos\".\nDan rejects these claims and says his videos \"are not meant to be taken as pure historical fact\".\n\"I encourage viewers to research history themselves if they're interested. I see these videos as a way to spark curiosity about the past rather than replace real historical education.\"\nHogne says he feels \"a responsibility\" in creating these videos and has been focusing on trying to make the videos as accurate as possible, \"especially now that so many millions of people are watching them\".\nDr Platts worries about misinformation spreading unchecked, noting that some viewers in the comments seemed unaware that the AI-generated videos were not based on historical facts.\n\"We see lots of students now using AI, and what's problematic is if they see something like this and then it's echoed back to us as if it's fact.\"\nDan says he ensures all his videos are labelled as AI-created, while Hogne says that misinformation has existed long before AI and \"people have to think critically about everything they are watching\".\nAll the historians the BBC spoke to agree that there are merits to Dan and Hogne's videos.\nDr Boyington says they can act as a \"gateway into history and can inspire someone to do their own research\", while a professor of Egyptology, Elizabeth Frood, says that \"if done accurately and reliably then this is of immense benefit to the public as it raises interest and awareness of history\".\nBarbara Keys, a professor of US history at Durham University, took a look at an AI-generated video of someone working at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on 6 April 1986, the day the reactor exploded.\nWhile she sees the potential merits in these videos, she calls the clip a \"black box\" as there's no source information or transparency about what information was fed to the AI programme.\nShe says a concerning inaccuracy in the video is that the reactor is based on images from after the disaster rather than before.\n\"This makes people think that Soviet technology was really bad when actually it was very sophisticated.\"\nShe thinks the viral nature of these videos is less about their historical content and more about the public's fascination with AI itself.\n\"There's nothing very interesting in the video, and it doesn't give you any information about the accident or what happened after, so the interest must be about what AI can do.\" \nProf Frood has concerns that the videos haven't been created accurately or reliably and emphasises that historical reconstructions should be based on extensive research and verifiable sources.\n\"We need to be critical of this video as we know nothing about its source or what information was fed to the AI in order for this video to be created.\"\nShe is commenting specifically on a video about being a child in Egypt in 1250 BC.\nThe first thing that struck her was how the videos tend to \"homogenise complex ancient worlds.\"\n\"Egypt spans thousands of years, and people might not realise that this is just one snapshot,\" she explains. \nOverall she says the video seemed \"poorly researched\" and pointed out an instance where a teacher in a school scene is reading the hieroglyphs backward when they should be read from right to left.\nHogne, who created the video, says he recognises that there are historical inaccuracies in his videos and that's because \"AI can make a lot of errors but in the future the tools will get better\". \n\"I try and spot them where I can but I am not a history expert so I don't always see the error, especially when it's something small,\" he adds. \nAsked about the lack of transparency in source material, Hogne says in the future he might consider adding links to where he got his information from.\n\"It would be cool to make it totally accurate using the right sources, but it's just me on my own making these videos and it takes eight hours to make each one.\" \nHogne relies on Chat GPT to research a time period and asks it for information about what people and places would have looked like. He then generates an initial image of someone looking out at a landscape and from there \"it's a lot of back and forth to get it right\". \nDan says it takes him four hours to make each video and he uses \"different AI tools to generate high-quality images, animate them, and craft realistic sound\".\nHe watches videos and reads documents to educate himself on a time period before making the video to try and give it \"some historical accuracy\".\n\"You have to give the AI every detail, from 'traditional Italian robes' to 'cobblestone floors' otherwise it will get creative and make random things you don't want.\"",

When you are doing the changes if you have a football team who are playing well and winning games, it is easier for the fans and everyone to feel that. But in this moment we are in a difficult period inside of the club and inside of the pitch.

If we improve the way we play the game, he will have more opportunities to score.\n\"He came here very young and, when you are very young, to be the number nine and play all the time sometimes is hard.\n\"We have to look at Rasmus as a player: he has the pace, he has the technique, he scores some goals that are really hard to score.\n\"Sometimes he doesn't choose the better runs, sometimes he's so anxious to touch the ball because he passes long minutes without the ball and he moves away from the goal.\n\"We address that in training.

Here, a speck of an island named Koh Mak has quietly positioned itself as a model for sustainable tourism, offering a rare vision of what the future of travel in Thailand could be.\nHeading towards Koh Mak's southern shores by speedboat, my first impression was disarmingly simple: golden sand curving into clear shallows while coconut palms leaned towards the sea as though caught mid-bow. There were no high-rises, no blaring beach clubs. Instead, low-slung bungalows peeked through the trees and bicycles outnumbered cars on the island's quiet roads.\nI checked into the Makathanee Resort next to the jetty and studied a map to get my bearings. Just 16 sq km in size, Koh Mak is flat apart from a few gentle hills, perfect for exploring by bike. Eager to tap into the island's slow rhythm, I pedalled north-east through plantations of rubber trees and coconut palms to Laem Son beach. Here, I found little more than a shack made of coconut trunks and fronds and a few deck chairs facing a blissfully empty stretch of sand. I ordered a coconut shake and enjoyed a delicious half hour soaking up the silence before heading across to the settlement of Ao Suan Yai. Even here, there was little to detract from the island's natural beauty, just several tastefully designed, low-key resorts tucked away behind a white-sand beach and a line of palms all leaning at the same angle towards the sea.\nAs I completed my brief tour, I was amazed to realise that during my bike ride I had seen no international hotels or shopping malls, no McDonalds or KFCs and not a single 7-Eleven, which seem to be on every street corner throughout the rest of Thailand.\nPromoted by the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) as the country's first low-carbon destination, Koh Mak has become a testing ground for how small islands can thrive without sacrificing their soul to mass tourism. Unlike its larger, better-known neighbours \u00ad\u2013\u00a0party-friendly Koh Chang to the north and exclusive Koh Kood to the south \u2013 Koh Mak is charting a slower, quieter course. Its approach, driven by the island's long-time landowning families, has earned international recognition for sustainable tourism. But it is the lived reality that truly sets it apart. This is not an island clinging to an imagined past; it's one that is actively shaping a different kind of future.\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nWhile many Thai islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Thai government, Koh Mak remains in the hands of five families, descendants of a civil servant named Luang Prompakdee who purchased the island's coconut plantations in the early 20th Century. Yodchai Sudhidhanakul, president of the Koh Mak Tourism Club and one of Prompakdee's descendants, told me that this tight-knit ownership structure has been key to protecting the island's tranquil character and encouraging slow tourism.\n\"It's not that we don't want tourists; in fact, many residents depend on tourism,\" Sudhidhanakul said. \"But we hope to attract a particular type of visitor \u2013 those who are respectful of others and appreciate the benefits of a quiet life.\"\nIn 2018, residents formalised their vision in the Koh Mak Charter. The agreement bans vehicle ferries from docking at the island, restricts motorbike rentals to 70% of room capacity, prohibits loud music after 22:00 and noisy water sports like jet skis, and bans the use of foam or plastic containers.\nWhen to visit Koh Mak\nKoh Mak's high season is between November and April. In the low season (May to October), the island is almost deserted although boats still make the journey. Some resorts close at this time but those that remain open offer cheaper rates.\n\"We never worried about overtourism,\" said Sudhidhankul, \"as our available accommodation has remained at a steady 750 rooms, but we wanted to be part of the low-carbon initiative. Thus, most resort owners use renewable energy where possible and make efforts to recycle and dispose of waste responsibly.\"\nThis ethos extends beyond policy. Local initiatives like the Koh Mak Coral Conservation Group offer snorkelling trips where visitors can learn how to propagate corals using recycled PVC pipes. Waste disposal is a collective effort, with regular beach cleanups coordinated by Trash Hero, a voluntary group with the motto, \"Every week we clean, we educate, we change\". And at the island's coconut plantation, visitors can learn how to harvest coconuts and make cold-pressed coconut oil, while tie-dye workshops teach traditional fabric-dyeing techniques using natural pigments.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n\u2022\u00a0 Here's where Asia's best female chef goes for pad Thai in Bangkok\n\u2022\u00a0 Thailand's cooling rice dish to beat the heat\nI spent the next few days earnestly practising slow-life activities: reading in a hammock, snoozing in a deck chair, swimming and taking long walks along the beach looking for shells. Unfortunately, most of what I found would only be of interest to the Trash Heroes \u2013 plastic bottles, old shoes and torn fishing nets. There were plenty of other activities to choose from, including diving and snorkelling trips, kayaking, paddle boarding, classes in massage and cooking, Thai boxing and yoga.\nHow to go green on Koh Mak\n\u2022\u00a0Rent a bicycle or golf cart to explore the island\n\u2022\u00a0Join the Trash Heroes on Saturday morning for their weekly cleanup\n\u2022\u00a0Eat local rather than imported food\n\u2022\u00a0Sign up for a long stay at the Koh Mak Campus\n\u2022\u00a0Join in any of the eco-friendly activities on offer\nI took part in a game of disc golf (aka frisbee golf) and joined a tie-dyeing workshop, where I made a shirt that gave me a great sense of accomplishment. Workshop leader Rodjamarn Sirirut showed us a display of more than 20 natural dyes made from local plants such as indigo, malabar, mango, mangosteen and coconut shell; impressive evidence of the island's natural diversity. These pursuits made a change from lounging at swim-up pool bars or stuffing myself at buffets as I might have done if I had been staying at an international resort.\nOne day I joined a snorkelling trip to Koh Rang, an island to the west of Koh Mak that is part of the Koh Chang Marine National Park. On the boat I chatted with Rong Rong Zhu, a former research scientist in the US who now spends most of her time on Koh Mak. \"When I travelled in Asia in 2018, I found Koh Mak to be a very walkable and bike-friendly island,\" she said. \"I was able to rent a house with a beautiful view and now I have many digital nomad friends who spend half the year here.\"\nKoh Mak is not immune to the challenges facing small islands. Plastic debris still washes up on its shores, swept in by ocean currents. And while the island's co-working hub, Koh Mak Campus, set up by Sudhidhanakul in 2020, encourages longer stays and digital nomads, balancing tourism and development remains a delicate task. \"We want to attract seasonal inhabitants, and we need to develop more expertise in the use of renewable energy.\" Sudhidhanakul told me.\nYet, as I slipped into the island's rhythm \u2013 cycling from one beach to another, sipping coconut shakes under palm trees and chatting with residents who spoke of their home with both pride and protectiveness \u2013 it became clear that Koh Mak offers something increasingly rare in Thailand.\nIt is a reminder that a different kind of tourism is possible, one that doesn't require sacrificing a place's spirit for progress. As the speedboat carried me back towards the busy mainland, I found myself hoping that Koh Mak's quiet revolution might inspire others to follow its lead.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Mohamed Salah has lost two Afcon finals with Egypt \nWho would have thought a discussion on the brilliance of Mohamed Salah would spark a heated social-media row about the merits of the Africa Cup of Nations?\nWell that's what happened when Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\".\nSo what did Carragher say? Who else has spoken out? And is Afcon disrespected by a European-centric view of world football?\nBBC Sport attempts to break down and explain the issues.\nSpeaking after Liverpool's 2-0 Premier League win at Manchester City on Sunday, pundits in the Sky Sports studio were discussing Salah's performance and whether this season could be one of the \"greatest\" individual campaigns.\nBBC Sport explored that discussion on Monday.\nThe debate then turned to whether Salah could be in line to win the Ballon d'Or - a prestigious annual award for the best player in the world.\nThe Ballon d'Or is voted for by 100 journalists from around the world, and was won last year by Manchester City midfielder Rodri.\nFormer Liverpool defender Carragher suggested Salah would have to win the Champions League in order to win the Ballon d'Or because Afcon is not recognised by voters as a \"major tournament\".\nHe added: \"I think the problem is the fact he's with Egypt, and he's probably not playing in the major tournament as such, or maybe got a great chance of winning, I think it's either the Champions League or the major tournament. Normally, the player who excels in that.\"\nCarragher's repeated use of the term \"major tournament\" irked fellow pundits Micah Richards and Daniel Sturridge. \nRichards stressed Afcon was a \"major tournament\", saying: \"A lot of people are at home saying 'They aren't taking it seriously.' Afcon is a big tournament.\"\nFormer Liverpool striker Sturridge said: \"It's a fact. If you win the Euros or Copa America it's deemed to be big - so the Afcon is at the same level.\"\nCarragher responded: \"Egypt are not going to win the World Cup are they?\" And when Richards tried to explain, he cut him off and said \"Oh God.\"\nClips of the exchange were shared widely across social media.\nOn Monday, Carragher attempted to clarify his comments on X, saying Salah was \"at a disadvantage playing for Egypt in terms of him winning the Ballon d'Or\".\n\"If Salah had an average season at LFC but won the Afcon & was MVP [Most Valuable Player] I don't think he would win the Ballon d'Or. Because I don't think Afcon carries the weight of other tournaments.\n\"But if Mbappe had an average season at Real Madrid but won the World Cup/Euros, he would still have a great opportunity.\"\nIs Salah set for greatest individual Premier League season?\nClub versus country dilemma for Afcon players\nEverything you need to know about Afcon 2023\nCarragher's comments drew criticism from a number of former players. \nWriting on X, former Aston Villa and Egypt captain Ahmed Elmohamady said: \"Jamie Carragher doesn't know what major tournaments [are] because he never won one. Afcon is a major tournament. So proud to [have] won it twice.\"\nFormer Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on his podcast that while he understood Carragher's point about the weight of Afcon on Ballon d'Or voting, he thought the comment was \"an ignorant thought process\" and Afcon should be \"respected more than it is\".\nCarragher - replying on Ferdinand's Instagram account - called his former England team-mate a \"clown\" and suggested he was \"playing to the gallery\".\nAfcon is held every two years and has typically been staged during European winter time.\nNo African nation has ever won the World Cup, and only one - Morocco at Qatar 2022 - has reached the semi-finals.\nIn a comparison of the wealth of the federations, Ivory Coast won $7m (\u00a35.5m) for winning Afcon 2023, Argentina won $42m (\u00a333.3m) for winning the last World Cup, and Spain won approximately 28m euros (\u00a323.4m) for winning Euro 2024.\nFormer AC Milan and Liberia striker George Weah is the only African player to have won the Ballon d'Or - having done so in 1995. \nSenegal and former Liverpool winger Sadio Mane - in 2022 - is the only African player to have finished in the top three in the voting in the 21st century. \nThe highest Salah has finished is fifth - in 2019 and 2022.\nIn 2021, former Arsenal and England player Ian Wright said some media coverage of Afcon was \"tinged with racism\", asking \"Is there ever a tournament more disrespected than the Africa Cup of Nations?\"\nTo get an idea of the value of Afcon, all you have to do is listen to some of the continent's greatest ever players. Legends such as Samuel Eto'o, Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba - or the big stars still in action, like Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Riyad Mahrez.\nThey have trophy cabinets full of medals and titles from European club football, but Afcon means everything to them.\nComparisons will always be made to the quality of the Euros and the Copa America, but - just like those tournaments - it's incredibly difficult to win the trophy for even the biggest names and biggest countries.\nI've lost count of the amount of times the tournament favourites have crumbled under the pressure, or in tough conditions against so-called smaller football nations.\nDrogba never won it despite playing in a golden generation of Ivory Coast talent. Salah is yet to lift the trophy, and I can still picture how devastated he was after losing the finals in 2017 and 2021.\nThe organisers also argue the interest in the tournament around the world is increasing all the time. And having been in Ivory Coast at the last edition, I feel that too.\nIt was one of the most exciting I've experienced with the dramatic storyline of the hosts sacking their manager in the group stage before making a remarkable comeback and winning the final. On the ground it certainly felt that it was bigger than ever before with more worldwide interest than ever before.\nYes, there have been many issues in the past that have damaged the reputation of the tournament. For example late changes to the location, such as when Egypt hosted in 2019 instead of Cameroon, who weren't ready. Or changes to the timing, for example with the next edition which was due to take place in June and July but will now start just before Christmas.\nThen there are difficulties with infrastructure, security or organisation. But similar issues have also impacted the Euros and the Copa America in recent years.\nI've always found complaints about the tournament taking place in the middle of the European season overblown. Yes it's frustrating for the clubs but why should African football be dictated to by the European game? Weather conditions also make hosting it in June and July impossible in certain areas of the continent.\nThe tournament may not get the respect it deserves in some parts of the world but after covering six Afcons I get the impression that's changing and that the next edition in Morocco, where football is booming right now, will be bigger than ever and may just have an impact on the Ballon d'Or voting.\nAfcon is being 'disrespected' - Wright\nClub World Cup dates 'disrespectful' to Africa\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes. \n\"They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.\"\nThe fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges. \nCatherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks. \n\"It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,\" she said.\n\"They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.\"\nShareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse. \nThey backed the board members supported by the company, as well as its executive compensation, including a pay package for Mr Cook worth more than $74m.

I didn't know how to deal with my emotions. It really affected my mental health and I had suicidal thoughts.\n\"Now I've learned to ignore the comments and if I can be bothered, I delete them.\"\nOfcom has previously issued guidance to tech firms around protections for children online and on dealing with illegal online content.\nSpeaking to Radio 5 Live, Dame Melanie said the organisation would \"absolutely\" name and shame companies who didn't comply with their guidance, so the public would know which companies were \"not taking [user's safety] seriously\".\nThe regulator wants sites and apps to adopt these measures voluntarily in what they call \"a safety by design approach\". For example, they could adopt \"abusability\" testing to identify how a service or feature could be exploited by a malicious user.\nRules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force this year, will compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide. The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography.\nContent creator Harriet Maynard has also experienced abusive comments, which sometimes escalate into pile-ons - where a large number of people harass a person online.\nHer Instagram posts are aimed at a female audience and relate to issues around parenthood and lifestyle content.\nDespite having mainly female followers, when a video of Harriet's goes viral, she says she receives \"an influx of negative messages, primarily from men\".\n\"I normally don't let it bother me, but when you get a wave of online abuse, it can get you down.\n\"In a 'normal' workplace, if you were being bullied or harassed, then there'd be an HR department to deal with it accordingly. But for us making content online for a living, there's nothing like that.\"\nNicole Jacobs, domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, welcomes the draft guidance.\n\"I'm pleased that Ofcom are stepping up to start the process of providing guidance to tech companies to tackle this,\" she said. \"It's now on these firms to implement these recommendations and ensure that perpetrators can no longer weaponise online platforms for harm.\n\"By taking meaningful practical action, not only will people be safer online, but it will demonstrate that tech companies are ready to play their part in tackling domestic abuse.\"\nProf Clare McGlynn, an expert in sexual violence, online abuse and the legal regulation of pornography, says she feels the guidance, which has no legal force, will struggle to make meaningful change.\n\"Experience shows that tech platforms do the absolute minimum necessary to comply with the law and little more. In the current climate, this is unlikely to change,\" she said.\n\"We urgently need to do more by strengthening regulation, making many of these recommendations legally binding. A dedicated Online Safety Commission which prioritises online harms would be a positive next step. \"\nSome of the suggestions to tech companies from Ofcom include:\nWhile a report from Ofcom shows women are five times more likely to suffer intimate image abuse and are more likely to report being negatively affected by harms experienced online than men, Dame Melanie said the guidance was not about \"women versus men or demonising men\".\n\"I think many men are really concerned about this as well. And that wider culture that's going on online, I just don't think it's healthy for anybody.\n\"The misogyny that's becoming normalised in some parts of the internet, that's not great for boys. It's not going to help them to form proper, strong, healthy relationships as they grow up. So I really hope men will get involved in this too.\"\nHarriet believes some of the suggestions by Ofcom would be ineffectual, such as popups on screen to make users consider if they wish to post abusive comments.\n\"I don't think these kind of people worry if they're going to offend someone by doing what they're doing. They hide behind their keypads. Complete cowards,\" she says.\nHowever, she would welcome more protections for women experiencing pile-ons if they were built into social media platforms, adding users should be able to protect themselves from \"pure abuse\".\nMiah feels the guidance may make some difference, if companies choose to follow it.\n\"I'd like to see tech companies do more,\" she says, \"[Ofcom has] a huge challenge, but real change is possible if they hold platforms accountable.\n\"Right now, reporting hate often leads nowhere - there needs to be stricter enforcement and actual consequences for harmful behaviour.\"\nIn a statement given to the BBC, Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, said: \"We remove any language that incites or facilitates serious violence, disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe that there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.\n\"We continue to work with women's safety groups to understand the different ways harassment towards women can show up, while improving our technology to find and remove abuse more quickly.\"\nThe BBC has also contacted other social media companies, including TikTok and X, for comment.\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article, help and support can be found on the BBC action line website.\nRadio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell is being joined by a panel of experts and a studio audience to discuss women and girls' safety online, in public spaces and at home.

        "article_text": "Mayara Lima is famous for her hypnotising samba style. Here, she shares the best samba experiences in Rio, from traditional school events to samba circles.\nBrazilians often say that \"everything ends in samba\", but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that samba never ends \u2013 at least not in Rio de Janeiro, one of the places where the musical and dance genre is said to have originated. Aside from providing entertainment, samba has played a crucial role in shaping Rio's lifestyle, including taking a central role in its Carnival celebration \u2013 the most renowned in the world.\nMore than just a genre, samba is a cultural phenomenon that helps drive the economy, with more than 150 official rodas de samba (samba circles) across the city. At these lively gatherings, musicians sit in a circle while crowds of hundreds \u2013 or even thousands \u2013 of spectators sing along, creating an electrifying atmosphere. Meanwhile, escolas de samba (community-based \"samba schools\" that organise the world-famous Carnival parade with its giant floats and thrilling costumes) elect a rainha da bateria (queen of the drums) who leads the school's bateria (drum section), captivating the crowd and forging a powerful connection between the musicians and the audience.\nThe SpeciaList\nMayara Lima is one of Rio's most popular samba queens, having claimed the title of drum queen in 2023. She currently represents the Para\u00edso do Tuiuti samba school, where she gained national recognition for her mesmerising samba style.\nBut the energy of samba can be felt in Rio all year round. Even outside Carnival season, events like samba school street rehearsals offer a vibrant and immersive experience. We asked\u00a0Mayara Lima, a rainha de bateria (drum queen) at Parara\u00edso do Tuiti, one of Rio's most renowned samba schools, how to experience the city's rich samba culture during Carnival and beyond.\nLima knew from an early age that dance was her calling, and she joined a samba school at age 10. \"I had studied other rhythms, such as ballet and jazz, but I decided to be fully dedicated to samba,\" she says.\nLima is a proud carioca \u2013 a Rio native. \"To me, Rio is far more than just a city,\" she says. \"What makes Rio so unique is the way it combines breathtaking natural beauty \u2013 its beaches and trails \u2013 with the energy of a vibrant, urban metropolis, where every neighbourhood has its own distinct charm and history.\" She adds: \"[But] you can't talk about Rio without talking about samba, can you? Their histories are intertwined.\"\nAhead of the 2025 Carnival, which runs from 28 February to 8 March, here are five of Lima's favorite samba experiences in Rio.\nRio's samba school parade is a global spectacle every Carnival season. Of the more than 70 samba schools, only a select few belong to the elite group that takes centre stage, parading down the Samb\u00f3dromo Marqu\u00eas de Sapuca\u00ed during the festivities \u2013 but the schools promote several events during the year that take place in the quadras (samba school headquarters), which play a key role in strengthening ties between the schools and the local community.\nTip:\nRio's music scene is about more than just samba. \"Baile Charme, an old-school R&B event, under the Madureira viaduct every Saturday [starts] at 20:00 and ends at the sunrise at 05:00,\" says Lima. This event has been going strong for over 20 years and remains a huge success, attracting thousands of people every week. \"It's a great way to see another side of Rio's music scene.\"\nCariocas and visitors of all ages come to samba schools to watch rehearsals, participate in feijoadas (a traditional feast of black beans and pork) and enjoy live performances of the school's samba anthem; a new one is chosen each year to serve as the narrative musical thread for each performance.\n\"There are 12 main samba schools [in Rio], which means 12 opportunities to experience samba,\" says Lima. \"While there's no fixed schedule for events, something is always happening. Each school hosts feijoadas several times a year. They feature guest performers playing not just samba, but also pagode [a type of samba/subgenre of samba] and carioca funk.\"\nFor Lima, the Gr\u00eamio Recreativo Escola de Samba Acad\u00eamicos do Salgueiro samba school holds one of Rio's best feijoadas. \"It's a thrilling event, it often happens in the first Monday of each month,\" she says. But her favourite type of samba school event is undoubtedly street rehearsals. \"As Carnival approaches, we hold street rehearsals every Monday in front of the samba school before heading inside to continue practicing,\" she says. \"It's amazing!\"\nEach school announces its events on social media. Street rehearsals are free, but other events, such as feijoada feast and samba circles, usually require a ticket.\u00a0\nWebsite: www.salgueiro.com.br\nAddress: R. Silva Teles, 104 - Andara\u00ed\nPhone: +552238-9226\nInstagram: @salgueirooriginal\n\u00a0\nPedra do Sal \u2013 a sloping set of stone steps found in Morro da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, known as Rio's \"Little Africa\" \u2013 is believed to have been the birthplace of samba in the early 20th Century. When the area served as a market for enslaved people and the unloading point for salt (sal in Portuguese) shipments, it also became a gathering place for enslaved Africans, who came together to honour their deities and play the instruments that became part of samba's DNA, like the pandeiro (tambourine).\nDuring the day, Pedra do Sal's rich history attracts small groups of tourists eager to understand Rio's past. But as the sun sets, the streets fill with vendors and hundreds of visitors drawn to the city's most famous roda de samba.\nOnce held only on Monday nights, the event grew so popular that organisers expanded it to four nights a week, from Friday to Monday \u2013 though Monday remains the busiest night. The music spills over Pedra do Sal's famous steps, creating an electrifying, open-air celebration.\n\"Pedra do Sal attracts such a diverse crowd \u2013 you'll find people from all over the city, from different backgrounds, and loads of tourists too,\" says Lima. \"It's a great mix, and that reflects in the music. Samba is the essence, but you'll hear other rhythms too.\"\nAddress: Rua Argemiro Bulc\u00e3o, s/n, Sa\u00fade,\nInstagram: @pedradosaloficial\nIn the city's northern zone, 21km from the historic Copacabana beach, hundreds of samba enthusiasts gather at the Pagode do Chinelo roda in the Pilares borough, right next to the renowned samba school Caprichosos de Pilares.\nLike most rodas de samba, the gathering started with modest expectations \u2013 just a group of friends meeting every Monday for a cold beer and some samba \u2013 but the samba do Chinelo quickly became a sensation and is now one of Rio\u2019s official rodas de samba, attracting locals and celebrities alike, and has since evolved into a professionally structured event.\n\"This is one of those places everyone goes to. It's a given that it'll be packed every Monday, with plenty of famous faces in the crowd. Sometimes you even see singers like [Grammy winner] Ludmilla performing \u2013 it's really cool,\" says Lima.\nThe event kicks off at 18:00 and carries on into the late night. Pagode do Chinelo is also the perfect spot to experience different samba styles. \"It's a great place to enjoy a more melodic samba, which is slower, or samba partido-alto, which is faster and more upbeat. It's brilliant fun,\" says Lima.\nAddress: Rua Faleiros, 1, Pilares\nInstagram: @resenhapagodeechinelo\n4. Best for experiencing classic samba: Cacique de Ramos\u00a0\nThe northern zone of the city is also home to one of Rio's most traditional rodas de samba.\nTip:\nFor those looking for a more laid-back way to explore Rio, Lima recommends having breakfast inside the Jardim Bot\u00e2nico. \"Some of the cafes in the garden allow you to enjoy a morning meal surrounded by nature overlooking century-old trees,\" she says \"It\u2019s the perfect place to start your day in a relaxing atmosphere before exploring the city's other attractions.\"\nFounded in the 1960s, Cacique de Ramos became famous for its legendary samba gatherings, where some of the genre's most celebrated artists first rose to prominence. Often described as the \"headquarters of samba\", it has played a pivotal role in shaping Rio's Carnival culture.\n\"This is where you'll find classic samba,\" says Lima. \"Cacique de Ramos is the birthplace of many greats, including Arlindo Cruz, Zeca Pagodinho and Beth Carvalho. If you want to experience that unique energy, this is the place to go.\"\nThe samba takes place every Sunday in Cacique de Ramos samba hall, making it an ideal option for those looking to enjoy a lively evening without a late finish. \"Since it's on a Sunday, Cacique de Ramos wraps up around midnight,\" says Lima. \"So if you need to be up early the next day but still want to make the most of your weekend, it's perfect. It's definitely one of my favourites.\"\nWebsite: www.caciquederamos.com.br\nAddress: Rua Uranos, 1326 - Olaria\nPhone: +55213251-4374\nInstagram: @cacique_de_ramos\nBar\u00f3dromo is a well-known samba venue among cariocas and a favourite gathering spot for samba enthusiasts. The walls are adorned with Carnival costumes and masks, immersing guests in the samba atmosphere the moment they step inside.\n\"It's always buzzing, absolutely packed,\" says Lima. \"It's a bar with a proper traditional samba roda, where people clap along to the beat \u2013 it's such a great vibe. The whole place is dedicated to samba, and that's what makes it so special.\"\nThe venue is open from Tuesday to Sunday, with samba sessions every night, ranging from performances of traditional samba to live sets from samba school baterias.\nBar\u00f3dromo is a popular venue that frequently fills to capacity, occasionally leading to slower service. However, the lively atmosphere and infectious energy of the crowd create a fully immersive experience, with the music at its heart.\nAddress: Rua Dona Zulmira, 41 - Maracan\u00e3\nInstagram: @barodromo\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

We asked\u00a0Mayara Lima, a rainha de bateria (drum queen) at Parara\u00edso do Tuiti, one of Rio's most renowned samba schools, how to experience the city's rich samba culture during Carnival and beyond.Lima knew from an early age that dance was her calling, and she joined a samba school at age 10. Here, she shares the best samba experiences in Rio, from traditional school events to samba circles.Brazilians often say that \"everything ends in samba\", but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that samba never ends \u2013 at least not in Rio de Janeiro, one of the places where the musical and dance genre is said to have originated. \"For Lima, the Gr\u00eamio Recreativo Escola de Samba Acad\u00eamicos do Salgueiro samba school holds one of Rio's best feijoadas.",

        "article_text": "With its sun-drenched lifeguard towers, bronzed surfers and bikini-clad volleyball players, Will Rogers State Beach is one of the most recognizable stretches of sand in the world thanks to the global cult classic \"Baywatch\".\nBut now the iconic beach is surrounded by the ruins of burned homes and palm trees, its parking lot a sorting ground for hazardous waste from the wildfires. The beach babes have been replaced by Environmental Protection Agency crews in hazmat suits sifting through melted electric car batteries and other hazardous waste before it's trucked away to landfills.\nThe Palisades and Eaton fires generated a staggering amount of debris, estimated to be 4.5 million tonnes. In comparison, the devastating Maui fires of 2023 generated about 400,000 tonnes, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.\nThose fires took three months of clean-up by the EPA, which is in charge of removing hazardous waste. But now the agency is hoping to finish their job in LA in just a month - by 25 February - after President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding the EPA \"expedite the bulk removal of contaminated and general debris\".\nThe decision to sort through the hazardous waste along the coast has prompted protests and as the clean-up of fire debris moves at unprecedented speeds, many are asking if and when the ocean water will be safe for swimming and surfing.\n\"In this very vulnerable place, they're sorting this very hazardous, hazardous stuff,\" said actor and environmentalist Bonnie Wright. \n\"To me, this feels like 10 steps backwards, because you're literally putting this waste even closer to the beach than it already is in the burn sites.\"\nMs Wright, who played Ginny Weasly in the Harry Potter films, wrote a book on sustainability and devotes most of her time now to environmental causes. \nWhile their battle to move sorting sites away from the coast ultimately failed, she said activists were successful in urging the EPA to move burned electric vehicle batteries to the Will Rogers site down the road and away from the sensitive Topanga Creek watershed.\nThe EPA said the burned vehicle batteries are an especially dangerous challenge but that the agency has the expertise to deal with them. To sift waste, they need a large space with roads big enough for truck traffic - which is why the Pacific Coast Highway, which runs along the beach, is more attractive than inside the windy, mountainous roads of the Palisades.\nWhen lithium ion batteries are damaged - especially by the high heat and flames of a wildfire - they have the potential for reigniting and exploding days, weeks, or even months after they've been impacted, said Steve Calanog, the EPA's incident commander for the LA fires.\n\"We have to treat them like unexploded ordinance, or, as the military calls it UXO,\" he said.\nAlthough some have questioned the speed with which the EPA has moved to clean up the toxic debris, he said there is no time to waste.\n\"We have to do this very quickly,\" he said, noting that they started sorting waste even as the fires were still raging.\n\"If we are delayed, the risk of impacting the ocean, it goes up again.\"\nMr Calanog was also in charge of the EPA response to the Maui fires, which may hold clues for how to measure what is safe and reasonable when it comes to testing water and soil samples.\nMany are concerned about the impacts of heavy metals and chemicals in the air and water after the fires. In Maui, it's been nearly 18 months since the fires and a small part of the coast around Lahaina is still closed to the public. The Army Corps of Engineers - which removes heavy debris after the EPA removes hazardous waste - just finished their last haul from Lahaina on 20 February.\nBut most of Maui has remained open to locals and tourists and the Hawaii Department of Health announced eight months after the fires that the coastal waters around Lahaina were safe for ocean recreation.\nThe scale of the clean-up from the Los Angeles fires, however, is unprecedented and the largest in US history.\nLA County closed beaches along a nine-mile (14 km) stretch for weeks following the fires in January. Then torrential rain - while helping douse any smouldering embers - caused mudslides in the burn area and runoff of toxic ash and chemicals into the ocean, prompting further closures.\nNow most beaches are reopened but a water advisory remains in effect along the coast from Santa Monica to Malibu until further notice advising \"beach goers may recreate on the sand but continue to be advised to stay away from visible fire debris and to stay out of the ocean water during any posted ocean advisory\".\nOnly the most dedicated and local surfers could access the beaches in the burn area anyway - there's no parking or stopping for about 9 miles along Pacific Coast Highway, which is clogged with trucks and workers cleaning up debris.\nThough some will risk most anything to catch a good wave.\nWhile touring the EPA sorting site, Annelisa Moe said she saw two surfers in the water at a popular surf break on Topanga Beach while she watched workers across the street in full PPE handling burned EV car batteries.\n\"The water looked like chocolate milk with like brown foam on it,\" recalled Ms Moe, who is the associate director of Science & Policy, Water Quality at Heal the Bay, an environmental nonprofit dedicated to making coastal watersheds healthy.\n\"It was one of those days, in between storms, like beautiful, sunny, 75 degree weather type of days,\" she said. \"And so it felt a little bit odd to be there amidst the destruction while we have this perfect beach day.\"\nJenny Newman of the Los Angeles regional water quality control board told an LA County Public Health virtual town hall on 18 February that the initial water quality tests they conducted on 22-27 January \"came back better than we expected.\"  But the water board cautioned that people should follow county advisories to stay out of the water near the burn site.\nDozens of scientists and volunteers from Heal The Bay and a myriad of private and public sector agencies have also been testing water and soil samples to see what levels of forever chemicals and heavy metals are present in the ocean, but toxic analysis can take 4-6 weeks and there's very little data available.\nAt the Surfrider Foundation, volunteers test the ocean water all year long. But their small lab is testing for fecal bacteria - not arsenic. Now it's too dangerous to expose volunteers in the burn areas, so the staff have partnered with Heal the Bay and the University of Southern California to process their water samples.\n\"All our community members are ocean lovers. We have the same questions they have,\" said Eugenia Ermacora of the Surfrider Foundation. \"It's a concern, and everybody is asking, When can we go back? When is it safe? And I wish I had an answer.\"\nChad White, a surfer who grew up in the Palisades and who protested against the EPA sorting site along the Pacific Coast Highway, said there's no way he would surf there now - it would be too painful to look at the coast and be reminded of what has been lost. And there's too much metal and other debris in the surf.\n\"It's taken my desire to surf down to zero, not just because of the water quality, but just because of what's happening,\" he said over coffee in Topanga Canyon. He rode his first wave in 1977 at Will Rogers State Beach and taught his son to surf at age four and his wife at age 60.\n\"It's earth-shattering to someone like me,\" he said of the destruction along the coast. \"That beach means something to me too, and I'm one person. There are tens of, maybe hundreds or thousands of us that utilize the beach every day.\"\nMany of Mr White's friends lost their homes and he said people are traumatised to see what the landscape and coast around them looks like now.\n\"Every movie that you see, every film that makes anybody from any other part of the world want to come to California is based on their seeing that Pacific Coast Highway and those beautiful homes in Malibu, across along the beach. They're all gone,\" he said. \"Now it's a toxic waste dump.\"",

        "article_text": "In the new series of Influential with Katty Kay, actress and model Brooke Shields opens up about spending nearly six decades in the spotlight and how she finally overcame her imposter syndrome.\nMore than 40 years after Time magazine called her the face of a decade in a 1981 cover story, actress and model Brooke Shields says that she's finally confident enough to not feel like a failure. Speaking to the BBC's Katty Kay for her interview series Influential, Shields opens up about everything from landing an Ivory soap campaign as an infant to the fallout from that infamous Time photo shoot.\nIn 2023, a Hulu documentary, Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields, offered a glimpse into the reality behind the tabloid headlines, centering on the relationship between Shields and her late mother, Teri. With a new book released on 14 January, Brooke Shields\u00a0Is Not Allowed to Get Old: Thoughts on Ageing as a Woman, Shields comes into her own and embraces the difficult task of ageing in the public eye.\nHaving been working since she was an infant (on the aforementioned soap ad), Shields says her public association with youthful beauty - those iconic eyebrows and big hair - has made the ageing process even more of a challenge. \"[Having] a youthful face, just regularly getting older is almost viewed as a disappointment,\" she tells Kay. \"I think, psychologically, it's a very interesting thing\u2026 You really have to do a lot of work on yourself internally to be OK with not also being disappointed with yourself.\"\nShields had early success as a model (she posed for Calvin Klein and Richard Avedon aged 15) and then as an actress, when she starred in films like The Blue Lagoon (1980) and Endless Love (1981).\n\"I was the original influencer, actually,\" she jokes.\nSince then, she has parlayed her fame into partnerships with skincare brands, launched her own haircare line, Commence, and an online platform for women over 40, Beginning is Now. It's that community that she's embracing with her new book, with the realisation that some are starting to see her as a 59-year-old, not just the girl who starred in Pretty Baby.\nBeing so strongly associated with a decade hasn't helped shift public perception, even though she has worked consistently since then. \"It was a shock to me the first time I saw a wrinkle on a monitor, because I thought something was in the film,\" she says, revealing that she sometimes mistakenly believed she was immune to the passage of time. \"I knew that I had to find value beyond the surface and looks and beauty, because it was such a part of my upbringing and who I was to people.\"\nShields acknowledges that she's spent much of her life keeping up appearances, but she's had the privilege to see that Hollywood's focus on eternal youth isn't necessarily a universally held belief around the world.\n\"It's definitely a very American thing. I think you go to Europe \u2013 I'm not sure about the UK as much, but definitely in Italy and France \u2013 there is a certain respect and reverence for beauty, mature beauty,\" she says. \"We don't \u2013 we have not figured that out yet. I think, I hope it's changing a bit. I'm hoping to contribute to that.\"\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\nShe calls ageing liberating, not limiting. While Hollywood has been more welcoming of women of a certain age \u2013 just look at Demi Moore, Martha Stewart and Jennifer Coolidge's recent renaissances \u2013 Shields explains that there's a selfishness that arrives when things like children and career pressures aren't on the agenda anymore.\n\"I think that there's a freedom to it and there's so many different factors that when you delve into them, you understand why this is a prime of our life in a way that is focused on just us,\" she says. \"Not our biological clock, not societal pressures, not all of these things that we operate by \u2013 because your time runs out.\"\nShields's career since the 90s has been marked by focused diversification; exploring ways to find success away from her appearance. Her CV includes a Broadway stint in shows like Chicago, Cabaret and Grease, in addition to her TV and film work. She has published two children's books and written about postpartum depression. She is also mother to two daughters, Grier and Rowan, and earned a degree in romance languages and literatures from Princeton University.\n\"When you start to write books or take jobs in other mediums and you learn different skills, [like] Broadway, speaking, all of those things that sort of add to you as a human being, the onus on just looking a certain way or on [being] 'the face of a decade', which is ridiculous in and of itself,\" she says. \"I was a pretty face but you know, really?\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Entrepreneur Jane Wurwand on why 'high-touch will overshadow high-tech' in business\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\n\u2022 Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn explains the mindset of a winner\nShields says this self-reflection is what allowed her to finally feel able to rub shoulders with her peers. She tells Kay that during an event for the opening of Sunset Boulevard with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, she realised that she could hold her own. The imposter syndrome that had loomed over her years in the spotlight had evaporated.\n\"Everything that I've done and been and seen and grown from and learned gives me the opportunity to not be intimidated by any of these people in these rooms. I can admire them and I can look up to them and love their talent,\" Shields says. \"I can be good enough. I'm as good as [whomever] I used to hold up on a pedestal.\"\u00a0\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "From a lavish historical epic set in Sicily to a satire of Hollywood studios starring Seth Rogan, and the acclaimed final instalment of British Tudor drama Wolf Hall.\nIt's right there in the title \u2013 you can't keep a Marvel hero down. Or off the screen. After three seasons originally made for Netflix (running from 2015 to 2018), the new Disney+ series brings back the familiar cast of heroes, villains and everything in between. Charlie Cox is Matt Murdoch, aka Daredevil, the blind attorney with superhuman senses that he had once used to fight crime at night, before giving it up at the end of season three. Vincent D'Onofrio is Wilson Fisk, the former mob boss known as Kingpin, now the mayor. \"Why did you stop being a vigilante?\" Fisk asks Murdoch over a friendly cup of coffee at a diner. No matter. That hiatus won't last much longer, as the punching, kicking and mask-wearing action begins. Jon Bernthal is Frank Castle, or Punisher, a brutal vigilante who, unlike Daredevil, never gave it a second thought.\nDaredevil: Born Again premieres 4 March in the US and 5 March in the UK on Disney+.\nLuchino Visconti's 1963 classic film, The Leopard, is still one of the most opulent, romantic, political-historical epics of all time, with Burt Lancaster as the Prince of Salina, head of a fading aristocratic family, and Alain Delon as his revolutionary nephew, Tancredi. Both are caught between the past and the future in 1860s Sicily during the upheaval that unified Italy into one country. Netflix has adapted Giuseppe di Lampedusa's novel, the basis for the film, into this lavish six-part series, cast largely with Italian actors and shot in locations throughout Sicily. Kim Rossi Stuart plays the Prince, the leopard of the title, clinging to his old ways. Saul Nanni is Tancredi, whose love affair with Angelica (Deva Cassel) forms the romantic centre of the story, even while revolutionaries storm the streets and Tancredi has to choose his own path, with his uncle or with a new order.\nThe Leopard premieres 5 March on Netflix internationally\nIn his consistently droll voice, John Mulaney has leap-frogged through genres, from a series of priceless stand-up specials to appearing in \u2013 and writing \u2013 instant-classic Saturday Night Live sketches like Lobster Diner, and last year's John Mulaney Presents: Everybody's in LA, a series of six live talk-show episodes presented over consecutive nights. At once sending up and using the tropes of an old-time talk show, Everybody's in LA was such a critical and popular hit that Mulaney returns with this 12-episode series, each show live once a week. Everybody's Live promises a similar meta/retro mix as the last run, which had some amazing, funny guests \u2013 David Letterman and Bill Hader on the same episode, a surprise appearance by Will Ferrell \u2013 viewer call-ins, and offbeat topics like coyotes in Los Angeles. Richard Kind returns in the role of announcer/sidekick, along with Saymo the delivery robot, in a show that is both goofy and satirical.\u00a0\nEverybody's Live with John Mulaney premieres 12 March on Netflix internationally\nStephen Graham is everything everywhere all at once these days (no bad thing). He plays a Victorian-era boxer in A Thousand Blows, which just premiered, and is both star and co-creator with Jack Thorne (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child) of this psychological drama which has an unsettling theme. Graham plays Ed Miller, whose 13-year-old son, Jamie, is accused of murdering a girl who went to his school. Ashley Waters (Top Boy) plays a detective investigating the murder, and Erin Doherty (the crime boss in A Thousand Blows) is the psychologist assigned to treat Jamie. Each of the four episodes is shot in one continuous take, playing out in real time, which might add to the tension. The real test will be how effective that strategy is. Adolescence is directed by Philip Barantini, who made the one-shot approach so effective in the 2021 film Boiling Point (which, need we add, stars Stephen Graham).\nAdolescence premieres 13 March on Netflix internationally\nIn this drama that mixes elements of the police procedural with a family story of addiction, Amanda Seyfried plays Mickey Fitzgerald, a beat cop in Philadelphia assigned to the neighbourhood where she grew up, a place ravaged by the opioid crisis. When several women are serially murdered, she suspects the case might lead her to her sister, Kacey (Ashleigh Cummings), an addict and sex worker who has disappeared. The show weaves between past and present, with flashbacks to the sisters' fraught relationship and divergent paths, as Mickey deals with life as a single mother and with her increasing obsession with finding Kacey. The show has a lot to live up to. It is based on a bestselling novel by Liz Moore, who cowrote the series with its showrunner, Nikki Toscano. NPR called the book one of the Best of 2020, and if that's not enough, Barack Obama put it on his list of favourite books of the year.\nLong Bright River premieres 13 March on Peacock\nRidley Scott directed the first episode of this crime series, which becomes more than the typical drugs-and-criminals thriller thanks to its lead actors. Brian Tyree Henry (Atlanta, If Beale Street Could Talk) and Wagner Moura (Civil War) play old friends in Philadelphia with a small-time scam. Posing as agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency, they pretend to raid drug houses while really searching for cash to steal. By the end of episode one, they have targeted the wrong meth lab, and are on the run from both real government agents and the dealers whose business they literally blew up in an explosion. Henry and Moura bring unusual sympathy to the characters as the show combines the tension of their life-or-death danger with the stories of the people they care about and try to protect. Henry's character is especially affecting in his love for the stepmother who raised him (Kate Mulgrew). Peter Craig, a co-writer of The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick, created the series, which has a gritty texture that recalls The Wire.\nDope Thief premieres 14 March on Apple TV+ internationally\nEllen Pompeo and Mark Duplass star as Kristine and Michael Barnett in a series\u00a0 inspired by a tabloid-ready real-life case. The Barnetts adopt a seven-year-old Ukrainian orphan named Natalia Grace (Imogen Faith Reid), who has a rare form of dwarfism, and whose first adopted family has returned her. The trailer hints at a good deal of heightened drama, as Kristine begins to suspect that they do not know the truth about their child's age. \"Michael, I don't think she's a little girl,\" she says, a suspicion that eventually takes the couple all the way to court. Dule Hill plays a detective investigating the tangle of accusations and fears, and it is tangled. The actual events, which began in 2010, are so unusual and the saga so ongoing that it has already inspired three seasons of a documentary series on the Investigation Discovery Channel.\nGood American Family premieres 19 March on Hulu in the US and 7 May on Disney+ in the UK\nNetflix is calling this murder mystery from Shonda Rhimes's production company a\u00a0 \"screwball whodunit,\" with Uzo Aduba as Cordelia Cupp, a brilliant detective investigating a murder in the White House during a state dinner. With a comic tone and a cast of 157 suspects, it's Upstairs Downstairs at the White House with a corpse, as Cupp questions everyone from the assistant usher (Susan Kelechi Watson) and the pastry chef (Bronson Pinchot) to the president's mother-in-law (Jane Curtain) and oldest friend (Ken Marino). Randall Park plays an FBI agent who investigates with Cordelia, and as the trailer reveals, Giancarlo Esposito plays the murder victim, who had the important job of chief usher and was not popular with his staff. The show was created by Paul William Davies, a writer on Rhimes's White House-set series Scandal, who has gone for a very different tone here. His goal for the show was to \"Keep it FUN,\" he told Netflix. \"I want people to be entertained, I want them to laugh.\" The Residence arrives in a very different political landscape to the one in which it was created, and it will be interesting to see whether finding laughter in the White House now lands as escapist entertainment or tone-deafness.\u00a0\nThe Residence premieres 20 March on Netflix internationally\nViewers in the US have had to wait four months to see the series the Guardian called \"utter TV magic\" when it premiered on the BBC last November, but here it is. The second instalment of Wolf Hall, it is based on the last of Hilary Mantel's trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, the savvy but doomed advisor to Henry VIII.\u00a0Just as Mantel set the standard for historical novels, the first Wolf Hall series, adapted from the first two books, did the same for smart, beautifully made historical TV dramas. Nine years later, the ensemble that put that first part together is back, on screen and off, with Mark Rylance as Cromwell, Damian Lewis as Henry and Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Wolsey. The series was adapted by Peter Straughn, who was nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave (he's good at writing men in robes) and directed by Peter Kosminsky. The story picks up in 1536, the blood still fresh from Anne Boleyn's head rolling, and although history tells us how badly it all ends, watching the court intrigue unfold here in such ravishing detail is exhilarating.\nWolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light premieres 23 March on PBS in the US\nHollywood studios are an irresistible target of satire, from Robert Altman's 1992 gem The Player to Armando Iannucci's recent series The Franchise. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the co-creators of this series, have now made them the subject of a very funny romp, overflowing with cameos from real-life actors and directors. Rogan plays Matt Remick, a production executive who longs to greenlight art films. That's an unlikely goal after he is promoted to head of Continental Studios, with the mandate to make commercial hits. One project his corporate bosses insist on: a film based on Kool-Aid. If a product-inspired movie worked for Barbie, why not a soft drink? The first episode includes cameos from Martin Scorsese and Steve Buscemi. Paul Dano, Olivia Wilde, Charlize Theron, Anthony Mackie and many others play outsized versions of themselves. And the casting of the regular characters is inspired. Ike Barniholtz plays Matt's second-in-command and best friend, Catherine O'Hara is the mentor whose job Matt took, and Kathryn Hahn the studio's brash head of publicity.\nThe Studio premieres 26 March on Apple TV+ internationally\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Meanwhile US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels and a move away from low carbon projects.Some shareholders and environmental groups have voiced concerns over any potential ramping up on production of fossil fuels.Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.In 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",

        "article_text": "Authorities in the southern Indian state of Telangana are racing against time to save eight construction workers trapped inside a tunnel for more than 72 hours. \nAround 50 workers had been working inside the 43km (26.7-mile)-long tunnel, located in Nagarkurnool district, when a part of its roof caved in early Saturday morning.  \nOfficials say 43 of them managed to come out safely but efforts to reach the remaining eight men have faced repeated setbacks due to loose soil, mud and slush inside the tunnel. \nThey have also been unable to establish contact with the trapped men, or provide them with oxygen and other essential supplies.\nJupally Krishna Rao, a state minister overseeing the rescue effort, told PTI news agency that \"the chances of their survival are very remote.\"\nOn Monday an expert team of \"rat-hole miners\" - people trained in narrow tunnel navigation - arrived to clear the debris and get to the workers. The same team had sucessfully rescued 41 construction workers trapped in a tunnel after a landslide in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in 2023. \nApproximately 33km of excavation has been completed so far and roughly 10km remain, officials said on Tuesday. \nRescuers are using a train to get to a point from where they need to climb on to a conveyor belt to remove the debris. Reports say they are also continuously pumping out water to ensure oxygen supply within the tunnel. But the rough terrain of the region has slowed them down. \nAs rescue efforts continue, families of the trapped workers - most of whom are daily wage workers - are anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones. \n\"I just hope that this time my son comes back safe. I will never send him away to earn again,\" said Rampratap Sahu, a resident of Jharkhand state. \nOthers expressed anger at authorities for letting their family members \"come in harm's way\". \n\"Why did they send the men to work there when they knew of the risks involved in the project?\" asked Jaspreet Kaur, whose brother is among those trapped.\nA portion of the under-construction Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) collapsed around 13km from its opening at 8:30 local time (03:00 GMT) on Saturday. \nThe accident took place after a slab of concrete covering seepage on the roof slipped and fell off. At least a dozen workers were injured in the chaos. \nThe tunnel is part of the longest-running irrigation project of the Telangana government. Located in a hilly forested area, it passes through the Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam tiger reserve which is the largest in India. \nOfficials said construction work had resumed just four days before the accident, after a gap of almost three years. \nVarious relief teams, including personnel from the National Disaster Response Force, firefighters and soldiers from the Indian army, are at the spot. \nOfficials told BBC Telugu that a team of firefighters was the first to go inside on Sunday.\n\"We covered 11km by train, 2km by conveyor belt and the remaining distance on foot,\" an official, who wanted to stay anonymous, said. \"But then we hit a roadblock.\"\n\"There were tall mounds of mud and soft soil. The boring machine that was being used by the workers lay upside down, blocking all passage beyond.\"\nThe rescuers said they were forced to return from that point as they did not have the necessary tools and machines to clear the slush. \n\"We shouted and screamed, whistled and pointed torches, hoping for a response but didn't hear anything.\"\nRelatives of some of the trapped men are now desperately hoping for a miracle. \n\"When I left home, my wife held me, wept and said, do not come back empty handed. Bring back my son,\" said Rampratap Sahu, father of one of the workers. \n\"But what can I do? I can only sit here and pray to god to return my son to me. I want nothing else.\"",

We have to score goals. This is the idea.\"\nGuardiola is determined City will not leave the Bernabeu wondering or with regrets, saying: \"We must play with courage. We must be ourselves. It will need incredible courage and we must play to win.\n\"We could still lose, but we have to show that courage and be ourselves. We have to play so well, especially after the result we took away in the first leg.\"\nOpta statistics rate City's chances of advancing at a more optimistic 19.8%, but those percentages must be viewed through the prism of Real's history in this tournament and the muscle memory that kicks in for the 15-time winners when it matters.\nGuardiola's record with City against Real is chequered, though it started with victory in the last 16 in 2020, the two legs being played six months apart because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe most bitter moment came two years later when City led by two goals on aggregate in the 90th minute of the semi-final second leg at the Bernabeu, only for Rodrygo to score twice within seconds, Karim Benzema's injury-time penalty sending Real on to eventual victory over Liverpool in the final in Paris.\nWhen Guardiola, as Manchester City manager, claimed his third Champions League crown in 2023, after winning with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011, Real were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate in the semi-final, the Spanish champions then prevailing on penalties last season.\nHe said: \"I have some incredible memories here - sometimes good ones, sometimes not so good. \n\"We know at this stage, and in this stadium, the pressure is there - but you get that in Milan, in Barcelona, at Anfield. You have to suffer at these places, but you have to reduce those moments.\"\nReal's remarkable win against City in 2022 is the sort of sporting lightning strike Guardiola will seek to turn back on them, but he must do it with a fading team that has lost its domestic supremacy after winning a historic four successive Premier Leagues, and now faces the prospect of going out of the Champions League before the last 16 for the first time in 12 years.\nCarlo Ancelotti (left) and Pep Guardiola will be meeting in the Champions League for the 10th time\nThe wily Ancelotti was not taking Guardiola's bait about percentages when he spoke in Madrid on Tuesday, saying: \"He doesn't really think that. We don't think we have a 99% chance. We have a small advantage - and we have to take advantage of that.\"\nGuardiola responded: \"For the first time he didn't believe me. I always say what I think, and this time you don't believe me.\"\nStatistics pile up like giant obstacles in front of City's route to the last 16, explaining why Real are overwhelming favourites after two goals in a late surge gave them victory at Etihad Stadium.\nIt was the 40th time Real have won the first leg of a European knockout-stage tie away from home, progressing on 37 of the previous 39 occasions.\nCity's defeat, meanwhile, was the fifth time they have lost the first leg of a Champions League knockout-stage tie, going on to be eliminated on the previous four occasions.\nFor Ancelotti, this tournament's greatest coach with five wins, he will be meeting Guardiola in the Champions League for the 10th time, on eight occasions with Real against City. The Italian has won four of their nine meetings, never losing at home, winning two games and drawing two.\nOf more recent significance is that to unseat the holders, City will have to alter poor form in the competition after losing their past three away games to Sporting, Juventus and Paris St-Germain.\nGuardiola's spirits will be lifted by Saturday's 4-0 win over Newcastle United which included a hat-trick inside 14 first-half minutes for new Egyptian signing Omar Marmoush, while Erling Haaland demonstrated his quality with both goals in the first-leg defeat, his first against Real Madrid.\nHaaland has been prolific in the Champions League, scoring 49 goals in 48 games. If he scores at the Bernabeu, he will become the fastest player to 50 goals in appearances and age, at 24 years and 213 days.\nIt could even be a Champions League farewell to Manchester City for modern greats of the club such as Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and goalkeeper Ederson, while others such as Bernardo Silva and Mateo Kovacic are also in their 30s.\nGuardiola would not be drawn as he said: \"I would like to answer this but it will be at the end of the season. We still have a lot to play for, to qualify for the Champions League next season, we are still there in the Champions League this season. We have the FA Cup and the Club World Cup.\"\nSilva added: \"If you had told me at the start of the season that we would be in this position in the Champions League and the Premier League I wouldn't have believed you. We deserve to be in this complicated situation because of where we finished.\n\"We have to believe. We still believe things can go our way, but this season is certainly a lesson for the future.\"\nFor Manchester City, that future is now - in the forbidding, unforgiving surroundings of the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\nAnd if Guardiola can overcome those \"1%\" odds in this footballing cathedral, it will rank alongside the best results of his career.\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\nGet Manchester City news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Hollywood has had another eventful year: Deadpool faced off with Wolverine, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni sued each other, Inside Out 2 conquered the box office and Joker's sequel emphatically did not. \nThe Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.\nAwards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.\nAhead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.\n1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.\nWicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.\nThe musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.\n2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.\nThe US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.\nBut Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.\nOnly seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.\n3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat. \nThe Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown. \nIf he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.\n4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.\nIt might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins. \nEmilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.\nOnly one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall. \n5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.\nKieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.\nBut the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.\nA Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.\nEvery actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.\n6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.\nThe other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.\nThe Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race. \n7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.\nBeatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.\nDame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.\nWinners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.\nOn the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.\n8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.\nQuite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.\nJust behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.\nBradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.\n9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.\nThat might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.\nThe historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize. \nBut that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.\n10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.\nFrank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.\nSam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.\nPerhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.\nStan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.\n11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.\nThe British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.\nIts prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.\n12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.\nThe last two times the British star was nominated for best actor, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture. \nIf Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).\nHowever, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.\nOn the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.\nWhy wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.\n13. Diane Warren really wants to win.\nThe songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.\nBut Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?\nShe certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"\n14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.\nIt did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.\nThe last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.\n15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.\nI'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.\nMeanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress.\n16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.\nAs Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.\nNobody has ever done this before.\nWalt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films. \nAnd Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.\nIf Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.\nAnora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.\n17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.\nThe delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes. \n\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat. \n\"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\"",

        "article_text": "To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads.\nThis part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces.\nBut Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain. \nAs well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting.\nA decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014.\nIS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months.\nKurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary.\nAt the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).\n\nAs we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives.\nBut in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate.\nFor the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. \"Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,\" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. \"It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it.\"\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace.\nTurkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border.\nTurkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border.\nAs the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF.\nNow battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: \"Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege.\"\nIn the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years.\nNewrouz Ahmad says that having \"defeated IS in Kobane\u2026 we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too\".\nAt a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. \"I am 60,\" he says.\nIt's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed.\nAnd now the threat of another battle is looming.\nTurkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit.\nIn a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years.\nShe shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing.\nThe protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing.  The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured.\n\"An old man next to me was also injured,\" she tells me from her bed.\n\"I lost some blood\u2026 but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,\" she adds.\nHuman Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an \"apparent war crime\" by the Turkish-SNA coalition.\nThe Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that \"reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth\" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a \"conflict-ridden area on purpose\" to use them as \"human shields\u2026 in order to not to lose control on the said dam\".\nIt accused the SDF of using \"violence and terror\" to pursue \"its own separatist agenda\", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs.\nSyria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place.\nThe interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east.\nBut the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies \u2013 Turkey.\nAnd when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited.\nSpeaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before.\nBut the two sides have still not reached an agreement.\n\"In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,\" he says, adding: \"In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control.\n\"But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,\" he says.\nFor the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS.\nToday, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells.\nBut the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence.\nIt's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi.\n\"If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,\" he warns. \"That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters.\"\nThere is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks.\nThe walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle.\n\"So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,\" she says. \"Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?\"\nMs Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life.\n\"If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?\" she asks.\nSo while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?",

It was once thought that the only place in the body where endometriosis did not occur was the spleen, but in 2020 it was found there also.\nSymptoms include severe to debilitating pain often in the pelvic area, fatigue, and heavy periods, and the condition is also associated with infertility.\nResearch by charity Endometriosis UK found the average diagnosis time for endometriosis in Wales was nine years and 11 months in 2024. \nThis was the longest diagnosis time across the UK and had increased from nine years in 2020.\nElen said she was given no support from her GP while she awaited her diagnosis, adding: \"I have been offered the coil or the pill, [but] other than that I was given nothing which is so frustrating.\"\nShe said through her own research she had made changes to her lifestyle to manage her condition, including cutting down her alcohol and caffeine intake as well as engaging in low-impact exercise and prioritising sleep. \n\"I don't suffer nearly as much as I used to... [but] I have done that all on my own,\" she said. \nShe added: \"I think a narrative needs to be erased here. Because it's a condition associated with female hormones, people tend to link the symptoms with being dramatic and it's really frustrating to me.\n\"There is so much stigma around it and I think that stigma needs to be deleted.\" \nElen has called on the Welsh government to offer more funding, better information and greater sensitivity to women's health. \n\"I think GPs need to spend more time exploring symptoms and offering other solutions rather than just the pill or the coil, it's ridiculous,\" she said. \nThe Welsh government said endometriosis was one of the eight priorities outlined  in its Women's Health Plan for Wales.\n\"We have already funded endometriosis nurses in every health board, developed the Endometriosis Cymru website and provided \u00a350 million of additional funding to help cut the longest waiting times, which includes gynaecological conditions,\" it said.\nIt added \u00a33m would be used to establish a Women's Health Hub in every health board by March 2026, \"to support timely diagnosis and management of menstrual conditions including endometriosis\".",

        "article_text": "Inside the doping deal for tennis' world number one\nHe has won the past two Grand Slams - but less than a month after his Australian Open victory Jannik Sinner is the talk of tennis, after agreeing a doping deal which has seen him banned for three months.\nThe timing means the men's world number one will be back for the next major - the French Open. Convenient, critics say.\nThe controversial agreement between the Italian's legal team and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) officials has prompted accusations of favouritism and led to some players questioning their faith in clean sport.\nBut what really happened behind the scenes? And what impact might this case have on anti-doping?\nBBC Sport has spoken to key figures involved to establish the inside story - from the timing of the ban being \"compelling\" to the \"struggle\" of convincing Sinner to bear any ban at all when it was accepted he did not intend to cheat.\nLittle over a week ago, Sinner was practising in Doha as he prepared to play in the Qatar Open.\nBut he knew things might change quickly.\nBehind the scenes there were discussions that would rule him out of that tournament - and the next few months on tour.\nIn what ended up being a \"late night\" on 14 February, Sinner's lawyer Jamie Singer was deep in phone calls with Wada's most senior lawyer.\nThen, early the following morning, the surprise news emerged that the three-time Grand Slam champion had accepted an immediate three-month ban.\nSinner and Wada announced they had \"entered into a case resolution agreement\" over his two failed drugs tests last March.\nThis is a special mechanism that has been in place for the past four years and allows deals to be agreed to conclude doping cases.\n\"It all happened unbelievably quickly,\" Singer told BBC Sport. \"In a matter of a couple of days, really.\"\nSinner finished top of the men's world rankings in 2024 after a remarkable season where he won the Australian Open, US Open, the season-ending ATP Finals, five other ATP titles, and helped Italy win the Davis Cup\nHow do you persuade the world number one player to accept a ban for something he believes he is innocent of?\nThat was the challenge facing Sinner's team.\nTo understand the extent of that we have to rewind to August when an independent tribunal cleared him of wrongdoing.\nIt accepted Sinner's explanation that traces of clostebol - a banned anabolic steroid - had entered his system through inadvertent contamination from his physio during a massage.\nWada, while not challenging the tribunal's overall decision, appealed against the panel's ruling that Sinner \"bore no fault or negligence\".\nHowever, this would have carried a ban of \"one to two years\" at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). \nAlthough Wada initially called for this punishment publicly, eventually its officials came to feel this would not be the right outcome.\nWith time ticking before the Cas hearing in April, Wada made two approaches to Sinner's team for the case resolution agreement.\nThe first attempt was rebuffed as Sinner's team wanted to submit the full defence case first.\nThat was handed over on 31 January, and in early February the first \"concrete discussions\" began after the second approach.\nBut with Sinner always sure of his innocence and confident he would face no ban, would he accept a three-month suspension?\nHis lawyer Singer said it was \"quite tricky\" to convince Sinner to take the offer.\n\"When I was saying 'well, look, maybe we should settle for three months', he was saying 'well, why would we do that if the first independent tribunal found it was no ban at all, why would I accept three months now?',\" Singer said.\n\"My advice was 'one never knows what's going to happen at a hearing, we know that Wada are pushing for a year, if we don't accept their offer then they will go to court looking for a year and who knows what those three judges could do'.\n\"So the possibility of three months, in my view, was a good possibility.\"\nWada felt the independent tribunal should have punished Sinner for strict liability - that he was ultimately responsible for failing the two drugs tests.\nIts officials felt pursuing a suspension was key in defending the \"important principle that athletes do in fact bear responsibility for the actions of their entourage\".\nSo why was Wada happy to offer Sinner a three-month ban?\nWada's general counsel Ross Wenzel said there wasn't a \"fundamental change\" in how the agency viewed the case, but it came down to what it considered fair.\n\"This was a case that was a million miles away from doping,\" Wenzel told BBC Sport.\n\"The scientific feedback that we received was that this could not be a case of intentional doping, including micro-dosing.\"\nHad the case gone to Cas, the outcome would have either been a ban of at least a year or Sinner being cleared.\n\"I'm not sure that a sanction of 12 months in this case - if we'd have forced the tribunal into that position - or a case of 'no fault' would have been a good outcome,\" said Wenzel.\n\"One would have compromised an important principle under the code. The other one, in our view, would have been an unduly harsh sanction.\"\nCase resolutions have been allowed since 2021, and Wenzel said Wada had since struck 67 agreements.\nThe code is set to change from 2027, meaning cases where players have failed tests but were deemed not to be at fault - like Sinner - could be punished from a reprimand to a two-year ban.\n\"In two years, Sinner would simply have had a slap on the wrist,\" one source from an anti-doping organisation told BBC Sport.\nBy winning last month's Australian Open, Sinner became only the eighth player in the Open era to win each of his first three Grand Slam men's singles finals\nSome top players continue to believe Sinner has been given preferential treatment because of his status.\nBoth the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) and Wada flatly reject any suggestion that is the case.\nBut it is clear Sinner - and five-time women's major champion Iga Swiatek, who received a one-month suspension last year after testing positive for heart medication trimetazidine - have benefitted from being able to pay top lawyers to act quickly.\n\"A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair,\" said 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic.\n\"It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers.\"\nSinner's lawyer said he thought the swift resolution of the case came down to taking an \"unusual\" legal approach.\n\"From day one [Jannik] didn't challenge the science, he didn't challenge the test, didn't challenge the rules,\" Singer told BBC Sport.\n\"He accepted, even though it's a trace - it's a billionth of a gram - he accepted that he was liable for what was in his body.\n\"And so we didn't waste time and money on all of those challenges, which traditionally defence attorneys would throw the kitchen sink at.\n\"We just focused on the evidence of what actually happened, and when we did that we managed to do that very quickly and demonstrate very plausibly what had happened.\"\nSinger was also aware that the timing of the ban was as good as it could possibly be.\n\"We can't get away from the fact that you can't choose when these things happen,\" he said.\n\"So the fact that Wada approached us and in the next three months there are no Grand Slams, that seemed to me to make their offer more compelling.\"\nSeveral players believe the timing was suspiciously convenient, with Britain's Liam Broady saying it had impacted Sinner's career as \"little as possible\".\nAsked directly why the deal had come about now, Wenzel insisted it was not taken with the tennis calendar in mind.\n\"Because of the timing of the Cas proceedings, it happened to be decided on 14 or 15 February, whatever it was, last Friday,\" said Wenzel. \"It was a very late night, and it came into effect immediately, so that is the reason for the timing.\"\nThe Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) - an organisation co-founded by Djokovic which aims to increase player power - believes there is a lack of \"transparency\", \"process\" and \"consistency\" in the system.\n\"Supposed case-by-case discretion is, in fact, merely cover for tailored deals, unfair treatment, and inconsistent rulings,\" the PTPA said in a statement.\n\"It's time for change.\"\nThree-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka, writing on social media, said he did not \"believe in a clean sport anymore\".\n'Sad day for tennis' - Sinner doping ban 'leaves sour taste'\nAre there different approaches to tennis doping cases? \nWhat happens next for Sinner after doping case?\nThis week, BBC Sport bought Trofodermin over the counter in an Italian pharmacy - the warning that it contains a drug on Wada's banned list was clearly visible\nAnother talking point has centred around why Sinner's former physio and trainer - who were both deemed responsible for clostebol entering the player's system - have not faced any action from the authorities.\nPhysio Giacomo Naldi was treating a cut on his own hand using a popular over-the-counter spray provided by fitness trainer Umberto Ferrara.\nTrofodermin is readily available in Italy for skin abrasions, cuts and wounds.\nIt contains Clostebol, a steroid that can build muscle mass and enhance athletic performance.\nNeither Naldi nor Ferrara were found by the independent tribunal to have intentionally acted to break doping rules.\nAccording to Italian law, the packaging on Trofodermin must have a visible \"doping\" warning. \nOver the past few years several Italian athletes - across tennis, football and athletics - have tested positive for clostebol.\nSinner has since parted ways with Naldi and Ferrara, but players, including Broady, have publicly questioned how the entourage of one of the world's leading players could have made such a mistake.\nWhile Sinner serves his ban, Ferrara is continuing to work on the ATP Tour with another Italian player, former Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini.\nSinner is allowed to return to competitive action on 5 May - just days before the Italian Open begins in Rome, and ahead of the French Open at the end of the month.\nFrom now until 13 April, Sinner can practise at a private training base, if he does not come into contact with other professional players.\nUnder Wada rules, he can start 'official training activity' from 13 April.\nSinner is not allowed to attend any ATP, WTA or ITF events in any kind of capacity until the ban is lifted on 5 May.\nSince the news of his ban emerged a week ago, Sinner, who lives in Monte Carlo and has family in northern Italy where he grew up, was said by a member of his team to have been \"resting\" as he takes stock of the situation.\nIf he returns at the Italian Open, Sinner will likely receive a hero's reception from the home fans who idolise him.\n\"Most tennis fans here think the ban is absurd and are still supporting him. 'Sinner-mania' has not wavered,\" Italian journalist Daniele Verri told BBC Sport.\nWhether he will receive that type of support at Roland Garros remains to be seen.\nThe mood within the locker room could also be frosty, given the sceptical public reaction from many.\nHowever, a source close to Sinner said he had also received support from some of his fellow ATP players, pointing to the public comments made by the likes of Jack Draper, Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Sonego.\nAsked if Sinner was aware of - and upset by - the negative reaction from some players, the team member pointed to Sinner's repeated comments that he \"cannot control what people think or say\".\n\"Jannik is a very resilient young man, and in his own mind he knows he's done absolutely nothing wrong and the process has been absolutely by the book. So I think he's very comfortable in himself,\" Singer told BBC Sport.\n\"He keeps off social media where there are an awful lot of people with a platform, and who don't necessarily know the facts of the case, or investigate the facts of the case as much as they might do.\"\nWada believes the Sinner case has shown the system is working.\nBut it cannot duck the reality that, for as much as everyone involved might insist this case has been handled by the book, it has left some people feeling very uneasy.\nThe full fallout and ramifications of the deal may well leave a cloud hanging over the rest of the season.",

        "summary": "And what impact might this case have on anti-doping?BBC Sport has spoken to key figures involved to establish the inside story - from the timing of the ban being \"compelling\" to the \"struggle\" of convincing Sinner to bear any ban at all when it was accepted he did not intend to cheat.Late night calls that led to 'unbelievably quick' dealLittle over a week ago, Sinner was practising in Doha as he prepared to play in the Qatar Open.But he knew things might change quickly.Behind the scenes there were discussions that would rule him out of that tournament - and the next few months on tour.In what ended up being a \"late night\" on 14 February, Sinner's lawyer Jamie Singer was deep in phone calls with Wada's most senior lawyer.Then, early the following morning, the surprise news emerged that the three-time Grand Slam champion had accepted an immediate three-month ban.Sinner and Wada announced they had \"entered into a case resolution agreement\" over his two failed drugs tests last March.This is a special mechanism that has been in place for the past four years and allows deals to be agreed to conclude doping cases. Although Wada initially called for this punishment publicly, eventually its officials came to feel this would not be the right outcome.With time ticking before the Cas hearing in April, Wada made two approaches to Sinner's team for the case resolution agreement.The first attempt was rebuffed as Sinner's team wanted to submit the full defence case first.That was handed over on 31 January, and in early February the first \"concrete discussions\" began after the second approach.But with Sinner always sure of his innocence and confident he would face no ban, would he accept a three-month suspension?His lawyer Singer said it was \"quite tricky\" to convince Sinner to take the offer. \"In two years, Sinner would simply have had a slap on the wrist,\" one source from an anti-doping organisation told BBC Sport.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, By winning last month's Australian Open, Sinner became only the eighth player in the Open era to win each of his first three Grand Slam men's singles finalsBacklash on the tour from playersSome top players continue to believe Sinner has been given preferential treatment because of his status.Both the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) and Wada flatly reject any suggestion that is the case.But it is clear Sinner - and five-time women's major champion Iga Swiatek, who received a one-month suspension last year after testing positive for heart medication trimetazidine - have benefitted from being able to pay top lawyers to act quickly. \"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sinner finished top of the men's world rankings in 2024 after a remarkable season where he won the Australian Open, US Open, the season-ending ATP Finals, five other ATP titles, and helped Italy win the Davis Cup'Tricky to persuade Sinner to accept deal'How do you persuade the world number one player to accept a ban for something he believes he is innocent of?That was the challenge facing Sinner's team.To understand the extent of that we have to rewind to August when an independent tribunal cleared him of wrongdoing.It accepted Sinner's explanation that traces of clostebol - a banned anabolic steroid - had entered his system through inadvertent contamination from his physio during a massage.Wada, while not challenging the tribunal's overall decision, appealed against the panel's ruling that Sinner \"bore no fault or negligence\".However, this would have carried a ban of \"one to two years\" at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). \"I'm not sure that a sanction of 12 months in this case - if we'd have forced the tribunal into that position - or a case of 'no fault' would have been a good outcome,\" said Wenzel.",

In 2020, the season halted, delayed and then restarted in front of no supporters because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Liverpool won the Premier League and Leeds won the Championship, returning to the top flight after a 16-year absence.\nDaniel Farke's side are now five points ahead of Sheffield United, who are in the other automatic promotion place, and seven in front of third-placed Burnley. After Saturday's visit by West Brom to Elland Road, 10 out of Leeds' last 11 games will be against teams outside the top 10.\nIn all likelihood, work will be going on behind the scenes to try to make Leeds' next top-flight campaign far different to their last, which ended in relegation after three seasons.\nMaking an impact will not be easy.\nIn the past 15 years, 42% of all promoted teams have dropped back to the Championship in the first season. That rises to 50% in the past decade.\nAmpadu faces surgery in blow for Wales and Leeds\nLeeds stun Sheff Utd with comeback to go five clear\nLatest Leeds United news, analysis and fan views\nFormer Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa remains a legendary figure among fans from their last promotion into the Premier League.\nFirstly, let's deal with the elephant in the room. Marcelo Bielsa.\nWhen Leeds were last promoted in 2020, they did so under the guidance of a man who has assumed legendary status in West Yorkshire.\nBielsa took a group of average players and turned them into a collective force. \nThey shrugged off the heartbreak of missing out on promotion in 2019 by going up the following season and then finishing ninth in the Premier League. \nThey played exhilarating, attractive football and were a joy to watch.\nBielsa's team eventually faded, shattered by the demands placed on it. Bielsa was sacked in February 2022, with the Leeds hierarchy fearing relegation.\nIt was an astute move as Bielsa's replacement, Jesse Marsch, kept them up. But the stay of execution lasted only a year and Bielsa's reputation among supporters remained high. \nFarke accepted the challenge. The former Norwich boss signed a four-year deal in July 2023. His first season ended with 90 points but defeat by Southampton in the play-off final at Wembley.\nMany fans wanted the German out. It was never going to happen.\n\"I always thought he had a two-year window, so I never felt he was in jeopardy,\" said BBC Radio Leeds commentator Adam Pope. \n\"They got 90 points and the basis from which he started was such a mess. Players were agitating to leave and I don't think he knew who was going to be available from match to match. \n\"It was an extraordinary effort to get as far as they did. But this was the year it has felt like it had to happen.\"\nFarke himself will have a point to prove, as well as big question marks over his own Premier League credentials.\nHis Norwich team bounced between Championship title winners in 2019, Premier League relegation in 2020 and promotion again in 2021, before he was sacked 11 games into his second Premier League campaign in November 2021. Farke's top-flight record is six wins from 49 games.\nDaniel Farke won two Championship promotions in three seasons with Norwich\nOne source with knowledge of the inner workings of Leeds explained the issue the club had on their last three-year stay in the Premier League was that then-owner Andrea Radrizzani just didn't have the funds to kick on.\nRadrizzani's shares were bought by the 49ers Enterprises when they took over Leeds in the summer of 2023, The investment arm of the American football franchise San Francisco 49ers is also attempting to buy a significant stake in Glasgow Rangers.\nThey proved that they have the finance by methodically working through what has been described as the massive 'credit card bill' of instalment payments for transfers from a sizeable churn of players in and out of Elland Road.\nDoubtless they will have a plan for this summer and beyond.\nHowever, there are two issues that are inescapable.\nFirstly, Leeds are hamstrung by the knowledge two seasons in the EFL slices \u00a344m off the maximum \u00a3105m three-year loss limit that applies to the rest of the Premier League.\nAnd beyond that, how much will survival actually cost?\nFor the second year running, the three teams that were promoted from the Championship are looking likely to go straight back down. \nTwo of them, Leicester and Southampton, have far more recent top-flight experience than Leeds. Their struggles prove jumping up from the Championship - even with the benefit of parachute payments - is one thing, but staying there is another matter entirely.\nLeeds clearly need at least one striker. They sold Georginio Rutter to Brighton for \u00a340m in August, which sets a benchmark for a decent Premier League forward. \nWhen you start adding in creative midfielders, full-backs and a goalkeeper - Illan Meslier added another mistake to this season's 'crime sheet' by scoring an own goal to give Sheffield United the lead on Monday - the millions rack up.\nTwo of Farke's mainstays, Joe Rothwell and Manor Solomon, are on loan and will need to be bought or replaced, so the bill for a decent shot at survival is going to be astronomical.\nElland Road has been Leeds United's home since the club was formed in 1919\nOne way of paying for this would be to generate greater revenue from Leeds' vast fanbase.\nPlans are already in place to expand the dated Elland Road stadium from its current 38,000 capacity by redeveloping the West Stand and the Revie Stand to eventually take the capacity to 55,000.\nThe aim is to use the same model as Liverpool, whose work on the Anfield Road stand was done by building over the top of the existing structure.\nBut this work will not be cheap. Leeds need to be in the Premier League before club chiefs press ahead.\nFor Leeds' financial executives, a delicate balance needs to be navigated between ploughing resource into infrastructure and Farke's squad. Ideally, it should be a twin track process and fans understand that.\nAfter Monday's match, I asked Farke if he felt an \"obligation\" to take Leeds back to the Premier League.\nHe said not. But the answer was revealing.\n\"In the last 25 years, we were promoted to the Premier League once and had three seasons in it, one outstanding season for Marcelo and two difficult ones, including a relegation,\" he said.\n\"At the moment, you are not allowed to label us as an established Premier League side. This is what I want to change.\n\"It is good for us to stay humble. At this club, after a win, everyone speaks about Europe, after a loss, people are saying we will probably go down to League Two. That is what these clubs are all about.\n\"It is a great honour to be in this chair at this amazing club. It is a great responsibility but it comes with pressure. \n\"Everyone expects us to win. That is what Leeds is all about.\"\nLatest Leeds United news, analysis and fan views\nListen to the latest Don't Go To Bed Just Yet podcast",
