In February, he announced 27% tariffs on Mexican imports and also repealed his presidential decree that had granted amnesty to undocumented Venezuelan migrants in the country.\nHis campaign was notable for its focus on young people - he is 37 - with a strong emphasis on job creation and slick social media videos. He also pledged to invest in infrastructure in the country and tackle corruption.\nAfter her defeat, Gonz\u00e1lez accused the electoral authorities of trampling on democracy, and demanded a recount.

Meanwhile, Justin and Hailey Bieber, singer Tate McRae and Austrailian rapper The Kid Laroi were spotted dancing at Yeat's set on Friday night.Headline acts this year include Megan Thee Stallion, rapper Post Malone and US punk-rock band Green Day at the 100,000-attendees-a-day event.Allow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter. \"The future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation.",

England and Wales Cricket Board chair Richard Thompson said it was \"a really well-deserved honour\" for an \"England legend\" who has \"given so much to our sport\". \"Anderson's decision to retire from international duty came after England coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes decided they want to build an attack for the future.He was given an emotional farewell in the first Test against West Indies at Lord's last July and then immediately joined the England backroom team as a fast-bowling mentor.He no longer has a formal coaching role with England and could still work with the squad during the summer, although he said his priority is to continue his playing career for Lancashire.Anderson has not played since he retired from international cricket but has signed a deal to play for the Red Rose county this summer.Burnley-born Anderson said at the start of the month he is not ruling out playing for up to three more years.He is currently out with a calf injury picked up during pre-season training which has ruled him out of the first block of County Championship matches.Anderson made his Lancashire debut in white-ball cricket in 2000, before making his red-ball debut in 2002.He has taken 1,114 first-class wickets, 358 in List A cricket and 41 in T20s.Related topicsCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished31 January \"This is fitting recognition for a true world great who has given so much to the game on and off the field. \"His skill, determination, and sportsmanship have inspired millions of cricketers and fans alike, in England and around the world.",

        "article_text": "Norris leads Max Verstappen in the drivers' title by one point going in to Sunday's race\nBahrain Grand Prix\nVenue: Sakhir Dates: 11-13 April Race start: 16:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Race live on BBC Radio 5 Live. Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nLando Norris said he felt \"clueless\" and \"like I have never driven a Formula 1 car before\" after qualifying sixth for the Bahrain Grand Prix.\nThe Briton's McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took pole position, while Norris was 0.426 seconds slower than the Australian.\nNorris said: \"No big complaints. The car's amazing. The car's as good as it has been all season, which is strong.\n\"Just I've been off it all weekend. I don't know why. Just clueless on track at the minute. I don't know. I just need a big reset, that's all.\"\nThe 25-year-old leads the world championship by one point from Red Bull's Max Verstappen and is 13 ahead of Piastri before Sunday's race.\nVerstappen qualified seventh, while Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, Mercedes' George Russell, Pierre Gasly's Alpine and the second Mercedes of Andrea Kimi Antonelli are between Norris and Piastri on the grid.\nNorris said: \"I just don't know how to approach it. I can't figure it out. Every time I try something, it's good for one session and then it's the wrong thing for the next session because the wind's changed, and I just can't flow with the car. And when I can't flow, I'm just not very quick.\n\"I've just got to work on myself. I can't fault the team and the car is the best by a long way. But clearly I'm just not clicking at the minute.\"\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella said Norris had suffered from a weakness that has been afflicting him since the start of the season, in that he is struggling to extrapolate the best from the car in qualifying because of certain handling characteristics it has.\nStella said: \"Lando is a very fast driver, a naturally fast driver with an incredible race-craft. It's more a phase, I think, when it comes to Q3, putting together the lap, that hasn't worked very well recently, but this is a short phase.\n\"He is just now in this temporary phase in which, while pushing the car to the limit, there's a few things that don't go exactly as he expects, and when you go for the extra 0.1secs in Q3, this becomes more visible.\n\"We understand what it is. It will just require a bit of adaptation from Lando himself, and some adaptations from the team. But I think the understanding is good, and we are very optimistic that this will be resolved.\"\nStella said that the issue does not manifest itself in races, when drivers are not pushing as hard.\n\"This doesn't affect the race pace,\" Stella said. \"Already in practice Lando has shown a very strong lap in the race run simulations, so I'm really looking forward to seeing Lando finding his way back tomorrow to the front of the pack.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcLaren mistakes & Tsunoda vindication: What to know ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix\nLewis Hamilton was another driver struggling to explain his deficit to his team-mate.\nThe seven-time champion qualified ninth, six places and 0.597secs behind team-mate Charles Leclerc, who was promoted to second on the grid because of a penalty for Mercedes' George Russell.\nHamilton said: \"Not much to say. I'm just not doing a good enough job. Have to keep improving. I will try and see if I can get in the top five. We will see. Clearly the car is good enough. Certainly not a good feeling, for sure.\"\nPressed for how he will improve in qualifying, he said: \"I really don't know. I really don't have a lot of answers for you guys. Just wasn't quick today.\"\nFerrari have been disappointed by the pace of their car so far this season, notwithstanding Hamilton's victory in the sprint race in China at the second grand prix.\nLeclerc said he had been trying \"extreme\" car set-ups in trying to find more pace.\n\"At the beginning of the season, we obviously weren't where we wanted to be,\" Leclerc said, \"and since two or three races I've gone in an interesting direction setup-wise, which seems to help me to extract a bit more out of the car. That's what I'm trying to do every weekend. For now, it seems to be better and better, which is a good sign for the future.\"\nFerrari have a new floor on the car in Bahrain, which Leclerc said had worked as intended but should prove a bigger advantage at other races to come.\n\"The team has done a really, really good job. We've all pushed quite a lot in the last few weeks because we've been struggling with performance.\n\"I know that at the factory they've been pushing like crazy to try and bring this floor a bit earlier on, and that definitely made the difference.\n\"Because if I look at the gap with P4, it's not that much and I'm pretty sure that without the floor I wouldn't be P3. So that's already one position won.\n\"I'm curious to see what it will do tomorrow [in the race]. However, it's probably not the best track to extract the maximum out of this new upgrade, but in the next few weekends we shall see more of it.\"\nVerstappen, who suffered a problem with the braking system on his Red Bull as well as inconsistent grip, said he was hopeful of being able to fight with the cars behind the McLarens in the race.\n\"In the past, high-deg tracks have been good for us,\" Verstappen said, \"but with the balance we had today it will be very difficult. But of course I am only looking forward. The McLarens will be too quick but the others we can follow.\"\nPiastri takes Bahrain pole, Norris in sixth\nF1 bosses reject V10 engine return\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions",

At times, though, it seemed in doubt.\nSo what happened behind the scenes?\nWas there a \u00a3500m offer from Saudi Arabia and how did the Egypt forward go from being unsure of his future to expressing delight at signing a deal that lasts until he turns 34?\nSenior football correspondent Sami Mokbel reports\u2026\nWhen Salah set the cat among the pigeons about his future in November by saying he was 'more out than in', he wasn't being disingenuous.\nYet it was also not misleading to say the Egyptian always wanted to stay at Liverpool. The two stances weren't necessarily mutually exclusive.\nIt has always been Salah's ambition to extend his eight-year stay at Anfield \u2013 and news today of his new two-year contract will bring the 32-year-old's tenure at the club to a decade, should he see out the duration of the terms.\nBut the conditions \u2013 for both Salah and Liverpool \u2013 had to be right. Thankfully for the club's supporters a middle ground was finally reached.\nSources close to the situation indicated a breakthrough in talks between Salah, his representative Ramy Abbas Issa and Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes was reached at the end of March, with the formalities of the deal concluded earlier this week.\nIndeed, in an interview with BBC Sport, left-back Andy Robertson revealed he only found out about Salah's new contract on Thursday.\n'Perfect marriage goes on - Liverpool and Salah need each other'\nSalah signs new two-year deal with Liverpool\n'Liverpool's future is bright with new Salah deal'\nThis video can not be played\nAre Liverpool taking a gamble with Mohamed Salah?\nSalah is not taking a pay cut to stay at Liverpool - and will earn close to \u00a3400,000-per-week.

The 'homecoming' of one of the greatest and recognisable Arab footballers - and the synergy, and earning power, for all parties was inescapable.\nIndeed, sources have told BBC Sport that Salah was in line to earn at least \u00a3500m in Saudi \u2013 an eye-popping figure, although still short of the 1bn euros (\u00a3859m) Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr was reportedly offered.\nIt was said the option of exploring a Saudi move was first raised with Salah last February - and that door will likely remain open in the future. \nBut, right now, the forward has put sporting ambition ahead of his wallet.\nSalah's a player at the top of his game - those close to the frontman believe he has at least another three years at the highest level.\nThe evidence suggests as much. His physique is optimum and his levels of professionalism are obsessive.\nSalah believes he still has more to accomplish in European football too, starting, of course, with winning Liverpool's 20th league title this season.\nHe has ambitions on winning the Ballon d'Or too, with fifth his highest placing in both 2019 and 2022.\nSalah also wants to win the Champions League again, and ensure Liverpool remain at the pinnacle of English football.\nInterestingly, it is said another one of the key factors in his decision to re-sign was a desire to compete among the elite to help prepare for Egypt's forthcoming World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations campaigns.\nIt's the sporting challenge that has driven his decision for Salah, although the fact his wife Magi and daughters Makka and Kayan are enjoying life on Merseyside has also been described as a key factor too.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "A new exhibition documents American photography's first 70 years, exploring the US during a period of immense social, geographical and industrial change.\nModern culture is indebted to photography. \"We can't be literate in today's world if we don't know how to make and share and interpret images\", Jeff Rosenheim, photography curator at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, tells the BBC. \"And when did camera culture become so much a part of all of our lives? It actually started in the 1840s and 50s.\"\nThough originating in Europe, \"the speed with which this medium took hold in the US is one of the great surprises,\" says Rosenheim, who, thanks to the incredible range of early American images in the William L Schaeffer Collection, a recent gift to the museum, saw an opportunity \"to tell an expanded story about the birth of this medium\".\nThe New Art: American Photography, 1839-1910, which opened on 11 April, documents American photography's first 70 years through 225 photographs, reversing the usual top-down approach by focusing on unknown makers that tell nuanced stories about the US during a period of immense social, geographical and industrial change.\n\"I quickly realised that there was fantastic picture-making, really important stories, outside of the big cities, all across the country,\" says Rosenheim. One such story is embodied in an anonymous 1950s daguerreotype (an image created on silver-coated copper plate) of a young man holding a chicken \u2212 a man for whom a painted portrait was probably unaffordable. But, thanks to this new art, he had made his way to a studio, along with his feathered companion, to receive his likeness.\nHolding the pose \u2013 sometimes for minutes rather than seconds \u2212 was essential to a good image, and the bird's minimal blurring suggests it was at ease in the boy's arms. Though photography was in its infancy, the sharpness of the image, from the boy's freckles to the rooster's scaly feet, is remarkable. The young farmer's photograph captures the spirit of the American pioneers and is filled, says Rosenheim, \"with pride and optimism for his own future\".\nIt would be another decade before the US would abolish slavery, and a century before the Civil Rights Act prohibited racial segregation. As a result, the theme of agency is implicit in many of these early images. An 1850s daguerreotype of a woman wearing a tignon (cloth turban) is a reminder of the Tignon Law in colonial Louisiana that required free black women to cover their hair. In response, some women reclaimed the tignon as an object of beauty and pride. This elegant portrait, with its extraordinary detail \u2212 from the delicately carved earrings to the weave in the translucent shawl \u2212 provides an opportunity for positive self-representation against a background of racial discrimination and negative stereotyping.\nFor the 19th-Century US, the making of these images was a spectacle in itself. In a rare photograph printed on salted paper around 1855, we see this wizardry at work. \"There's this sort of magic about photography, that you have to go into the box itself, in a certain sense, and cover your head to make a picture,\" says Rosenheim. But for all the photographer's mastery, they are never entirely in control. Edward's Steichen's famous 1903 portrait of JP Morgan is an example; it inadvertently conveys his impatience with posing, and an innocent object \u2013 the chair handle \u2013 appears like a dagger in his hand.\n\"The world coalesces and comes together in ways that the photographer intended and did not,\" says Rosenheim. \"A painter can always redo things. They can add and subtract. A photographer, until recently, had to accept what the film or the plate recorded.\"\nThough the miracle of photography captured America's imagination, it was still deemed inferior to fine art. Pioneers such as John Moran, who came from a family of artists, challenged this by demonstrating the medium's creative potential and the unacknowledged artistry involved in making images. \"It is the power of seeing and deciding what shall be done, on which will depend the value and importance of any work, whether canvas or negative,\" he argued in an essay published in The Photographic News of 1848. In his landscapes, we see a more atmospheric, ethereal quality that goes beyond realism to emphasise mood and emotion. \"There are hundreds who make, chemically, faultless photographs,\" he asserted, \"but few make pictures.\"\nWhile the daguerreotype was indebted to France, the tintype \u2013 an image created on blackened iron \u2013 was an American invention. Producing high-quality results at a low cost, with no need for a studio, the tintype, peddled by itinerant photographers, meant remote communities and those of limited means could now also take part.\nThe broadening of access was reinforced by the industrialisation of the US, with the railroad and the telegraph connecting distant corners of the country \u2013 to the detriment of the Native American population who were pushed into ever-decreasing spaces. This geographic expansion, supported by topographic photography, is encapsulated in a c 1870 tintype of a man, perhaps a railroad worker, with his surveying equipment. Occupational portraits such as this, featuring workers with the tools of their trade, were a popular way to show the pride people took in their work and how they were contributing to the burgeoning American society.\nIn an 1870s tintype of a boy posing with a cornet, it may be an interest or talent, rather than a career, that this tiny keepsake records. On the left is a lock of his hair, fastened with paper flowers, possibly from his first haircut or perhaps obtained post-mortem. It was not uncommon for families to employ a photographer to memorialise a deceased loved one who had never been photographed before. Photography is \"very linked\" to life and death, says Rosenheim. A photograph is always younger than we are, always reminds us of our mortality, but at the same time preserves us in time.\nAs sitting for a portrait became more commonplace, novel experiences were sought. In a self-deprecating, comical tintype from the 1870s, the sitter's headshot is surrounded by an imagined scene scratched into the metal plate. The studio was Golder & Robinson, on Broadway, New York City, also known for its photographs of public figures that people would collect in the form of \"cabinet cards'\" \u2013 slender photographs mounted on card.\n\"Cartomania\" as the craze became known, \"was somewhat driven by Queen Victoria, who sat for her portraits and everyone wanted them,\" says Rosenheim. The introspection of the self-portrait era was running alongside the dawning of a culture of celebrity, with \"everybody collecting pictures of everybody else\".\nWhile Golder & Robinson were distributing images of the good and the great, Alice Austen would use photography to speak up for the marginalised. She documented the daily lives of impoverished children, street sellers, and immigrants; and, as a queer women in a society that saw no place for same-sex relationships, questioned gender norms with her satirical images of women in the arms of other women, larking about in their underclothes or dressed as men.\nSeveral of these photographs involve Austen's close friend Trude Eccleston, who features in an 1888 silver print of a boat trip on Lake Mahopac. There's a charming complicity as a smiling Eccleston locks eyes with the photographer. The gaze goes unnoticed by the dozing men, one of whom Eccleston would eventually marry.\nCarleton E Watkins was a gold prospector who moved from New York to California to seek his fortune, but instead of taking from the landscape, made a career of photographing it, recording the humbling scale of its mighty glaciers, waterfalls and canyons. This awe was intensified by the stereograph experience, where two slightly different images were viewed through a stereoscope to create a 3D effect. In Watkins' picturesque View on the Columbia River (1867), the felled trees in the foreground hint at the impermanence of the US's breathtaking landscapes.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Eight striking images that define the US\n\u2022 How one image kickstarted the 90s\n\u2022 Eight photos of quirky US groups\nAs Miles Orvell writes in American Photography (2003): \"Nature, in this 19th-Century context, was land to claim and defend in the name of the US government, it was a wild land to be exuberantly explored, mined, and mapped\u2026 \u00a0And it was spectacularly beautiful.\" But photography was beginning to cast a critical eye on what this nascent civilisation was doing to this ancient wilderness.\n\"If the mood of the 19th Century was an essentially optimistic one, happy in its discovery and exploitation of the American continent,\" continues Orvell, \"the 20th Century began gradually to wake up from that dream, look around, and see everywhere the destructiveness of the machines that had invaded the garden.\"\nThe stories the camera told about the US and its people, argues Rosenheim, \"entered their consciousness in a way that no painting or sculpture, or other forms of art, ever have\". Most of the pictures in the exhibition have never been published and offer fresh insights into early photography's role in the making of America. This, Rosenheim says, has proved instructive. \"The more we release things that are not known, the more we learn about our own history.\"\nThe New Art: American Photography, 1839-1910 is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York until 20 July 2025.\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMcIlroy's dramatic Masters triumph\nHere we go again. That inescapable feeling engulfed Rory McIlroy's fans during a Masters Sunday they wanted to watch through their fingers at certain points.\nA nightmare start saw the nervous 35-year-old from Northern Ireland overhauled by nearest rival Bryson DeChambeau at the top of the leaderboard in a three-shot swing in the opening two holes.\nThen, after recovering to retake a three-shot lead with six holes left, McIlroy threatened to blow his chance yet again.\nThose willing him to win wondered if he was fumbling another golden chance to finally land the prize which had long eluded him.\nThe rollercoaster nature of his triumph, secured eventually at the first play-off hole, was essentially a microcosm of a career which has provided exhilarating highs and devastating lows.\nWhat his supporters had forgotten - understandably given the scar tissue they also had developed from his myriad near misses - was a very different McIlroy had emerged at Augusta National this week.\nA mature McIlroy. A calmer McIlroy. A patient McIlroy.\nMost importantly, perhaps, a McIlroy who has learned how to love himself again on the course after having his heart bitterly broken by the sport he adores.\nMcIlroy beats Rose in Masters play-off to seal career Grand Slam\nI wondered if it would ever be my time - McIlroy\nPodcast: Rory McIlroy completes career Grand Slam with Masters victory\nThis video can not be played\nWhat are we all going to talk about next year?\n\"At a certain point in life, someone doesn't want to fall in love because they don't want to get their heart broken,\" the world number two said in an illuminating pre-tournament news conference on Tuesday.\n\"Instinctually as human beings we hold back sometimes because of the fear of getting hurt, whether that's a conscious decision or subconscious decision.\n\"I think once you go through that, once you go through those heartbreaks - as I call them - you get to a place where you remember how it feels.\n\"You wake up the next day and you're like, 'life goes on, it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be'.\"\nMending his forlorn heart has built a resilience which helped McIlroy to execute special shots shortly after tough psychological moments on his path to Masters glory.\nIt has enabled the boy from Holywood to eventually achieve golfing immortality.\nOn Sunday, he roared back again to win the Green Jacket and become only the sixth man in 90 years of the four modern majors to win the career Grand Slam.\nWhat makes his achievement even more remarkable is getting there following a tumultuous 11-year journey since his previous major win.\n\"It was maybe one of the greatest performances ever, with so much pressure on him,\" McIlroy's sports psychologist Bob Rotella told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"What Rory is going to be so proud of is that he found out how unbelievably tough he is.\"\nRory McIlroy finally won the Masters on his 17th appearance at Augusta National - only Spain's 2017 champion Sergio Garcia waited longer\nFrom the moment on Tuesday when McIlroy opened up, you sensed there was something different in his mentality.\nWorking with Rotella - who helped Ireland's Padraig Harrington win three majors - has been a key factor.\nMcIlroy has known the renowned American since 2010 and the conversations between the pair intensified going into his 11th attempt to complete the career Grand Slam.\nMcIlroy said they talked before the tournament about \"trying to chase a feeling\" on the course, rather than \"getting too much into results and outcomes\".\nThe strategy worked perfectly in his opening 14 holes on Thursday. Then a pair of double bogeys dropped him seven shots off the lead.\nMcIlroy scarpered quickly from the course without speaking to the media, saying later he wanted to \"leave what happened\" behind at Augusta National.\nThe fast exit and a Friday morning chat with Rotella helped him bounce back into contention.\nA bogey-free 66, accelerated by five birdies on the second nine, moved him two behind Justin Rose at halfway.\n\"I had a good conversation with Bob, mostly around not pushing too hard too early and trying to get those shots back straight away,\" McIlroy said.\nPatience was also the plan for Saturday.\nMcIlroy and Rotella discussed \"letting the score come\" and not trying to \"force the issue\" as he chased down Rose.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch McIlroy claim his Masters green jacket\nA blistering start to his third round saw McIlroy sink three birdies and an eagle as he became the first player to card threes on each of the opening six holes.\nStill he was stony faced. The solemn expression demonstrated his steely focus and remained throughout another card of 66.\nMcIlroy refused to get carried away with the highs of that round, or too disheartened by a stickier patch around the turn.\n\"I certainly don't want to be a robot out there, but at the same time I don't want to be too animated, either,\" he said.\nMoving into a two-shot advantage over DeChambeau set up Sunday's box-office finale.\nThe contrasting approaches of the final pairing - McIlroy blocking out the noise, DeChambeau feeding off the rising decibels - added an intriguing layer.\nMcIlroy largely maintained his composure in what DeChambeau described as an \"electric\" atmosphere. \"He wouldn't talk to me,\" the maverick American said.\nKeeping his own counsel worked for McIlroy.\n\"Every time he made a mistake he came back and did something fantastic,\" Rotella, who has authored numerous books on sports psychology, said.\n\"It is like he had a will that was made of steel. He kept bouncing back no matter what they threw at him.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy's emotional message to daughter Poppy\nSwitching off from what happens on the course - or, at least, trying to - was another important factor.\nMethods which McIlroy used to zone out included watching racy period drama Bridgerton - which he claimed he was talked into by wife Erica - and Disney animation Zootopia with his four-year-old daughter Poppy.\nPicking up a fictional novel \"for the first time in a long time\" was another. Reading a John Grisham book called The Reckoning proved apt.\nOn the morning of his own day of reckoning, McIlroy spent the hours before his career-defining day watching sport.\nSpanish tennis star Carlos Alcaraz's win at the Monte Carlo Masters was followed by a \"little bit\" of Premier League football and the Formula 1 GP in Bahrain.\n\"I tried to keep myself distracted with other sports,\" he said.\nFamily time also helped McIlroy compartmentalise the day job. After Thursday's bitter blow, he said heading home to see Poppy before bedtime helped him move on.\nThe family took part in the Masters traditional par-three contest on Wednesday alongside McIlroy's close friends Shane Lowry and Tommy Fleetwood, and their wives and children.\nPoppy stole the show by knocking in a 25-foot putt and joined her father again on the 18th green after he secured victory on Sunday.\n\"I'm not going to compare this to life moments like a marriage or having a child,\" said McIlroy.\n\"But it's the best day of my golfing life.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy wins Masters play-off to complete career Grand Slam\nWhen 25-year-old McIlroy claimed the fourth major of his career - at the 2014 US PGA Championship - it felt inevitable he would quickly complete the collection at the Masters.\nBack-to-back majors at the Open Championship and US PGA - having previously won the 2011 US Open and 2012 PGA - signalled his dominance.\nA Green Jacket could have already been in the wardrobe, too, but he blew a four-shot lead on a haunting final day in 2011.\nIt sparked a long barren streak at all four majors, with McIlroy's heart crushed most recently at Pinehurst last June.\nThe world number two had charged up the US Open leaderboard to move two shots clear of overnight leader DeChambeau.\nThen, as McIlroy later admitted, he lost focus.\nBogeys on three of his last four holes allowed DeChambeau to snatch a dramatic victory.\nIt was a loss which cut deep. McIlroy fled Pinehurst swiftly, avoiding the media and laying low until the Scottish Open a month later.\n\"Some people have an experience like that and decide they don't want to get there again, it hurts too much,\" said Rotella.\n\"He said he wanted to win majors and could handle losing.\"\nWhile he missed the cut at the blustery Open Championship which followed, the bounce back in 2025 has been impressive.\nA dominant final round from McIlroy led to a two-shot victory at Pebble Beach in February, before he mentally reset to win last month's The Players Championship at Sawgrass in a play-off showdown on the Monday.\nAnd so to Augusta National. The guttural emotion following Sunday's winning putt was McIlroy shedding the weight of burden which had laid heavy.\n\"Every time you get your heart broken you have to bounce back and it makes for a better story \u2013 but you have to have the guts to keep going after it,\" Rotella added.\n\"A lot give up on themselves.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMcIlroy's dramatic Masters triumph\nHere we go again. That inescapable feeling engulfed Rory McIlroy's fans during a Masters Sunday they wanted to watch through their fingers at certain points.\nA nightmare start saw the nervous 35-year-old from Northern Ireland overhauled by nearest rival Bryson DeChambeau at the top of the leaderboard in a three-shot swing in the opening two holes.\nThen, after recovering to retake a three-shot lead with six holes left, McIlroy threatened to blow his chance yet again.\nThose willing him to win wondered if he was fumbling another golden chance to finally land the prize which had long eluded him.\nThe rollercoaster nature of his triumph, secured eventually at the first play-off hole, was essentially a microcosm of a career which has provided exhilarating highs and devastating lows.\nWhat his supporters had forgotten - understandably given the scar tissue they also had developed from his myriad near misses - was a very different McIlroy had emerged at Augusta National this week.\nA mature McIlroy. A calmer McIlroy. A patient McIlroy.\nMost importantly, perhaps, a McIlroy who has learned how to love himself again on the course after having his heart bitterly broken by the sport he adores.\nMcIlroy beats Rose in Masters play-off to seal career Grand Slam\nI wondered if it would ever be my time - McIlroy\nMasters & Slam success will 'free me up' - McIlroy\nPodcast: Rory McIlroy completes career Grand Slam with Masters victory\nThis video can not be played\nWhat are we all going to talk about next year?\n\"At a certain point in life, someone doesn't want to fall in love because they don't want to get their heart broken,\" the world number two said in an illuminating pre-tournament news conference on Tuesday.\n\"Instinctually as human beings we hold back sometimes because of the fear of getting hurt, whether that's a conscious decision or subconscious decision.\n\"I think once you go through that, once you go through those heartbreaks - as I call them - you get to a place where you remember how it feels.\n\"You wake up the next day and you're like, 'life goes on, it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be'.\"\nMending his forlorn heart has built a resilience which helped McIlroy to execute special shots shortly after tough psychological moments on his path to Masters glory.\nIt has enabled the boy from Holywood to eventually achieve golfing immortality.\nOn Sunday, he roared back again to win the Green Jacket and become only the sixth man in 90 years of the four modern majors to win the career Grand Slam.\nWhat makes his achievement even more remarkable is getting there following a tumultuous 11-year journey since his previous major win.\n\"It was maybe one of the greatest performances ever, with so much pressure on him,\" McIlroy's sports psychologist Bob Rotella told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"What Rory is going to be so proud of is that he found out how unbelievably tough he is.\"\nRory McIlroy finally won the Masters on his 17th appearance at Augusta National - only Spain's 2017 champion Sergio Garcia waited longer\nFrom the moment on Tuesday when McIlroy opened up, you sensed there was something different in his mentality.\nWorking with Rotella - who helped Ireland's Padraig Harrington win three majors - has been a key factor.\nMcIlroy has known the renowned American since 2010 and the conversations between the pair intensified going into his 11th attempt to complete the career Grand Slam.\nMcIlroy said they talked before the tournament about \"trying to chase a feeling\" on the course, rather than \"getting too much into results and outcomes\".\nThe strategy worked perfectly in his opening 14 holes on Thursday. Then a pair of double bogeys dropped him seven shots off the lead.\nMcIlroy scarpered quickly from the course without speaking to the media, saying later he wanted to \"leave what happened\" behind at Augusta National.\nThe fast exit and a Friday morning chat with Rotella helped him bounce back into contention.\nA bogey-free 66, accelerated by five birdies on the second nine, moved him two behind Justin Rose at halfway.\n\"I had a good conversation with Bob, mostly around not pushing too hard too early and trying to get those shots back straight away,\" McIlroy said.\nPatience was also the plan for Saturday.\nMcIlroy and Rotella discussed \"letting the score come\" and not trying to \"force the issue\" as he chased down Rose.\nThis video can not be played\n'A long time coming' - BBC Sport NI's interview with Rory McIlroy\nA blistering start to his third round saw McIlroy sink three birdies and an eagle as he became the first player to card threes on each of the opening six holes.\nStill he was stony faced. The solemn expression demonstrated his steely focus and remained throughout another card of 66.\nMcIlroy refused to get carried away with the highs of that round, or too disheartened by a stickier patch around the turn.\n\"I certainly don't want to be a robot out there, but at the same time I don't want to be too animated, either,\" he said.\nMoving into a two-shot advantage over DeChambeau set up Sunday's box-office finale.\nThe contrasting approaches of the final pairing - McIlroy blocking out the noise, DeChambeau feeding off the rising decibels - added an intriguing layer.\nMcIlroy largely maintained his composure in what DeChambeau described as an \"electric\" atmosphere. \"He wouldn't talk to me,\" the maverick American said.\nKeeping his own counsel worked for McIlroy.\n\"Every time he made a mistake he came back and did something fantastic,\" Rotella, who has authored numerous books on sports psychology, said.\n\"It is like he had a will that was made of steel. He kept bouncing back no matter what they threw at him.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy's emotional message to daughter Poppy\nSwitching off from what happens on the course - or, at least, trying to - was another important factor.\nMethods which McIlroy used to zone out included watching racy period drama Bridgerton - which he claimed he was talked into by wife Erica - and Disney animation Zootopia with his four-year-old daughter Poppy.\nPicking up a fictional novel \"for the first time in a long time\" was another. Reading a John Grisham book called The Reckoning proved apt.\nOn the morning of his own day of reckoning, McIlroy spent the hours before his career-defining day watching sport.\nSpanish tennis star Carlos Alcaraz's win at the Monte Carlo Masters was followed by a \"little bit\" of Premier League football and the Formula 1 GP in Bahrain.\n\"I tried to keep myself distracted with other sports,\" he said.\nFamily time also helped McIlroy compartmentalise the day job. \nAfter Thursday's bitter blow, he said heading home to see Poppy before bedtime helped him move on.\nThis time last year, there were rumblings of unrest at home and he filed for divorce during the week of the US PGA Championship in mid-May. But a month later that divorce petition was dismissed with McIlroy saying he and his wife Erica had \"resolved their differences\".\nThe family took part in the Masters traditional par-three contest on Wednesday alongside McIlroy's close friends Shane Lowry and Tommy Fleetwood, and their wives and children.\nPoppy stole the show by knocking in a 25-foot putt and joined her father again on the 18th green after he secured victory on Sunday.\n\"The one thing I would say to my daughter Poppy is never give up on your dreams. Keep coming back and working hard and you can do anything,\" he said.\n\"I'm not going to compare this to life moments like a marriage or having a child.\n\"But it's the best day of my golfing life.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy wins Masters play-off to complete career Grand Slam\nWhen 25-year-old McIlroy claimed the fourth major of his career - at the 2014 US PGA Championship - it felt inevitable he would quickly complete the collection at the Masters.\nBack-to-back majors at the Open Championship and US PGA - having previously won the 2011 US Open and 2012 PGA - signalled his dominance.\nA Green Jacket could have already been in the wardrobe, too, but he blew a four-shot lead on a haunting final day in 2011.\nIt sparked a long barren streak at all four majors, with McIlroy's heart crushed most recently at Pinehurst last June.\nThe world number two had charged up the US Open leaderboard to move two shots clear of overnight leader DeChambeau.\nThen, as McIlroy later admitted, he lost focus.\nBogeys on three of his last four holes allowed DeChambeau to snatch a dramatic victory.\nIt was a loss which cut deep. McIlroy fled Pinehurst swiftly, avoiding the media and laying low until the Scottish Open a month later.\n\"Some people have an experience like that and decide they don't want to get there again, it hurts too much,\" said Rotella.\n\"He said he wanted to win majors and could handle losing.\"\nWhile he missed the cut at the blustery Open Championship which followed, the bounce back in 2025 has been impressive.\nA dominant final round from McIlroy led to a two-shot victory at Pebble Beach in February, before he mentally reset to win last month's The Players Championship at Sawgrass in a play-off showdown on the Monday.\nAnd so to Augusta National. The guttural emotion following Sunday's winning putt was McIlroy shedding the weight of burden which had laid heavy.\n\"Every time you get your heart broken you have to bounce back and it makes for a better story \u2013 but you have to have the guts to keep going after it,\" Rotella added.\n\"A lot give up on themselves.

        "article_text": "A couple who watched in fear as a wildfire raced down a mountainside towards their home have said they worry the threat could get worse with climate change. \nFire crews prevented the flames from reaching Alison and Ian Jones' house backing onto the mountain above Treorchy in Rhondda Cynon Taf last month, but the close call has left them wondering how bad it could get. \n\"The fires in Los Angeles and Spain have been horrendous,\" Ian said. \"We're not on that scale, but who knows what's coming?\" \nProf Stefan Doerr, head of Swansea University's Centre for Wildfire Research (CWR), said milder weather in the coming decades means \"more fires and longer fire seasons\". \nA mild winter allowing for more foliage growth followed by spring droughts has made this year particularly bad for wildfires, he added.\nFirefighters have had to hold back raging wildfires from properties across Wales this week, with one Ceredigion councillor describing firefighters as being \"on their knees\".\nMr Jones said they were \"concerned every year\" because of mountain fires coming down to the edge of Treorchy, but a blaze on 21 March \"got a little bit close to the house\". \nHis biggest fear, he said, was for the safety of the firefighters. \n\"They put their lives on the line every time they go up there,\" said Mr Jones, who decided to fell a tree close his roof after the fire.\n\"I don't know where the solution is, but we've been here 20-odd years and we have had fires [in the area] every year.\" \nHis wife Alison, who was home alone when the flames came close, said she has trust in the system.\n\"Most of the firemen know the area so well and they know how to manage it.\"\nWildfires also make crews less able to respond to a property fire or a road crash.\nBut the workload and danger for fires crews seems to be getting worse. \nWith no major wildfires in Wales last year, Prof Doerr said the fields and mountains have had \"a lot of vegetation growth\". \nTogether with the spring drought it \"makes things pretty bad\" this year, he added. \nUnder the current climate change models for Wales, milder winters will mean more foliage to burn, followed by worsening spring droughts. \n\"Both are likely to become more extreme and these will make it more likely that we'll have more fires and longer fire seasons,\" he said. \nProf Doerr said a fire risk website, developed with South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, lets people check conditions in their area. \nBut people are more worried about the impact of fires on wildlife than themselves, according to a CWR survey. \n\"People tend to be complacent because they think the fire service has things under control,\" said Rhigos photographer Garan Thomas. \nThe 27-year-old said he feared a big fire could spread to properties because Rhigos is surrounded by fields.\n\"My house backs on a rugby pitch and a farm is close, so who is to say the fires wouldn't get in the back garden?\" \nSmoke from a Rhigos mountain fire hung over the town for more than a week in 2023. \n\"You wonder if there's enough [firefighting] equipment for this and if South Wales fire service is big enough to cope,\" he said. \nThis fire season is different, Mr Thomas added, with fires starting in places not seen before. \n\"Everyone expects a field or a mountain fire, but the frequency of them this year and the different locations is a bit concerning.\"\nFarmers have been setting controlled fires in the late winter and spring for generations, said Sian Jones, 64, from Crymych in Pembrokeshire. \n\"When the mountains are plastered in gorse you have cases like California with people going for a picnic and chucking glass and then you've got a problem,\" she said. \nShe said controlling the gorse is crucial to avoid wildfires.\n\"Nothing for me is more beautiful than seeing the controlled fires,\" she added.\nBut one such fire this year in the Preseli Hills, near the village of Brynberian, got out of control in high winds. \nIn the south Wales valleys most of the hills above towns like Treorchy are managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW), not farmers. \nNRW said the majority of land it manages in the area is forest plantations.\n\"Most of these fires begin on open ground and can quickly spread into forests, where fuel loads increase the intensity and impact of the fire,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"In the south Wales valleys, we've developed wildfire risk management plans for our high-risk areas and take practical action, such as putting in fuel breaks where vegetation is removed to slow down or stop the spread of wildfires.\u201d\nNRW said climate change was a \"key factor\" in the increasing risk of wildfires. \n\"We are adapting our fire risk management to respond to this \u2013 but partnership and public support are essential,\" it said.\nThe fire services, local authorities, public services boards and community groups work to \"assess and reduce wildfire risk through prevention, response, and education,\" NRW added.

        "article_text": "When his camera stopped working on his iPhone recently, New Yorker Richard Medina didn't waste any time. With the threat of tariff-fuelled price hikes on smartphones bearing down, he quickly called his phone company for a new one. \n\"I said, 'We've got to switch this out now,'\" the 43-year-old recalled. \"Let's take care of it.\"\nThe move was a sign of the pressure rising across the US, where households are being buffeted by what could be staggering price rises, and even possible shortages triggered by the sweeping tariffs that US President Donald Trump announced this month. \nSome are trying to stock up. Others say they feel paralysed by the changes, which have come quickly, or hope Trump will change his mind and reverse course - not an entirely unreasonable hope given the rapid changes in policy. \nTrump, facing financial market revolt over his latest tariffs, has already altered his plans repeatedly. \nFirst, he scaled back duties that had been planned on some countries, such as the European Union, in what was described as a 90-day pause. \nThen, as market turmoil continued, he exempted smartphones and other electronics from the duties, announcing the carve-out just a few days after Mr Medina felt pressure to make a purchase.  \n\"I can't keep up with the president. Every day is something new,\" said Anna Woods, 42, who recently received a message from her son's summer camp warning that the tariffs might affect pricing of standard gear such as T-shirts. \nThe 42-year-old, who works in legal operations, says she is nervous but unclear how to proceed. \n\"I just feel like we're living in uncertain times,\" she said, adding: \"I do need to make some purchases .... Everything is going up.\" \nThe latest tariffs include a 10% tax on the vast majority of imports - and an eye-popping 145% duty on goods from China, which is the third biggest supplier of imports to the US after the European Union and Mexico and a key source of essentials such as smartphones, shoes and umbrellas.\nThe measures followed previous orders that added 25% levies on cars, steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico. \nIn all, Trump's orders have pushed the average effective tariff rate on imports in the US to the highest level in more than a century.\nIn stores, the immediate impact has been limited, since many firms stockpiled some products in anticipation of some tariffs. \nBut the tariffs are widely expected to lead to higher prices in the months ahead, especially for items such as clothing, leather goods, electronics and toys, many of which are made in China.\nThe Budget Lab at Yale forecasts that prices for clothing could soar by more than 60% in the short run; basic pharmaceutical products could jump by 12%, and food prices rise by 2.6%.\nAll told, the typical US family is facing a roughly $4,700 jump in costs due to the new taxes, if purchase patterns remain the same, it estimates.\n\"I'm extremely worried about it,\" said 38-year-old mother Jamie Casey, one of more than a dozen people shopping at a Target in Brooklyn on a recent afternoon who shared their thoughts with the BBC about the tariffs. \nShe was in the store picking up formula - and some onesies and outfits for her daughter, who has yet to turn one.  \n\"I wouldn't say I'm panic-buying yet, but I am interested in how it plays out.\"\nMajor retailers experienced a jump in visits in the weeks leading up to Trump's tariff announcement, according to research firm Placer.ai, while purchases at the likes of Walmart and Target increased markedly in the immediate aftermath, according to data tracked by ConsumerEdge. \nThere has also been an uptick in US purchases on Amazon's e-commerce platform, where Chinese sellers dominate, CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC recently. \n\"I don't know if we can necessarily conclude it's panic-buying but there seems to be broad stock-up behaviour,\" said Michael Gunther, head of insights at ConsumerEdge, noting that two separate data sets used by the firm showed a pick-up.\nCristina Montoya said she had been buying extra canned food and frozen fruit, a little at a time for a few months, anxious about possible price increases, especially as a pensioner reliant on a fixed income.\n\"You never used to do your shopping nervous,\" the 74-year-old said. \"I feel like you have to buy a lot of things because you don't know what's going to happen.\" \nThe dynamic has added to the tariff turmoil.\nLast week, as the measures came into effect, some businesses started introducing tariff surcharges, while others abruptly cancelled shipments from China, unwilling to risk being unable to recoup the cost of the duties.\nThe disruption has the potential to cause near-term shortages in the US of items where China dominates the supply, such as baby carriages, colouring books and umbrellas, analysts at Macquarie noted this week. \nAnalysts say the pickup in consumer purchases is likely to prove temporary, or an acceleration of transactions that would have happened anyway.\nIf price rises start to hit, many economists expect Americans to opt for cheaper substitutes, delay purchases, or simply do without - a pullback with major consequences for an economy driven by consumer spending.\nKathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, is predicting the US economy will grow just 0.5% this year, and the unemployment rate will rise to 5% - the highest level since 2021 amid Covid. \nOther firms, such as JP Morgan, are forecasting an outright recession. \n\"In terms of the consumer, it does get a little tricky,\" Ms Bostjancic said.\n\"We could see consumer spending actually be strong in March and April but it's just because of this surge ahead of the tariff increases,\" she added. \"Going forward, consumer spending is going to be weaker.\"\nOn surveys, fears about both the economy and price rises are flaring, even though hiring has been solid and inflation cooled to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February.\nSome people shopping in New York said it felt like a whole way of life could be coming to an end. \nLouis Lopez, an elevator mechanic in New York City, said he was so worried about the economy he had started to squirrel away cash under the mattress. But he was also holding shopping bags with new work clothes and a pair of Nike trainers for the summer.\n\"You might as well buy it now ... while you have it good,\" the 56-year-old said. \"It's going to change everything for everybody.\"",

At times, though, it seemed in doubt.\nSo what happened behind the scenes?\nWas there a \u00a3500m offer from Saudi Arabia and how did the Egypt forward go from being unsure of his future to expressing delight at signing a deal that lasts until he turns 34?\nSenior football correspondent Sami Mokbel reports\u2026\nWhen Salah set the cat among the pigeons about his future in November by saying he was 'more out than in', he wasn't being disingenuous.\nYet it was also not misleading to say the Egyptian always wanted to stay at Liverpool. The two stances weren't necessarily mutually exclusive.\nIt has always been Salah's ambition to extend his eight-year stay at Anfield \u2013 and news today of his new two-year contract will bring the 32-year-old's tenure at the club to a decade, should he see out the duration of the terms.\nBut the conditions \u2013 for both Salah and Liverpool \u2013 had to be right. Thankfully for the club's supporters a middle ground was finally reached.\nSources close to the situation indicated a breakthrough in talks between Salah, his representative Ramy Abbas Issa and Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes was reached at the end of March, with the formalities of the deal concluded earlier this week.\nIndeed, in an interview with BBC Sport, left-back Andy Robertson revealed he only found out about Salah's new contract on Thursday.\n'Perfect marriage goes on - Liverpool and Salah need each other'\nSalah signs new two-year deal with Liverpool\n'Liverpool's future is bright with new Salah deal'\nThis video can not be played\nAre Liverpool taking a gamble with Mohamed Salah?\nSalah is not taking a pay cut to stay at Liverpool - and will earn close to \u00a3400,000-per-week. The two-year contract offers him a level of security players of his age are not often afforded.\nLiverpool have pushed the boat out, but haven't done so on a whim. Salah is a special case.\nReplacing their talismanic attacker, who has made 54 goal contributions already this season, would be vastly difficult and, more pertinently, an expensive task.\nIdentifying a Salah replacement would be hard enough, but finding the sort of money to pull off such a deal would enter a higher plane of difficulty.\nWhat appears to be Trent Alexander-Arnold's pending move to Real Madrid, when his contract expires this summer, would have provided Liverpool with greater financial leeway in their efforts to assemble financial packages to keep Salah and Virgil van Dijk, with the Dutchman expected to sign a new deal in the coming days.\nYet, while money is always a factor when it comes to contractual negotiations, it wasn't the determining consideration for a footballer at the peak of his powers.\nThis video can not be played\n'Oh my goodness!' - Salah's best Premier League Liverpool goals\nIf money was Salah's determining consideration, he'd have left Liverpool for the Saudi Pro League who, until as recently as last week, still believed they could attract him to the Middle East.\nThe financial lure of a move to Saudi Arabia was clear. The 'homecoming' of one of the greatest and recognisable Arab footballers - and the synergy, and earning power, for all parties was inescapable.\nIndeed, sources have told BBC Sport that Salah was in line to earn at least \u00a3500m in Saudi \u2013 an eye-popping figure, although still short of the 1bn euros (\u00a3859m) Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr was reportedly offered.\nIt was said the option of exploring a Saudi move was first raised with Salah last February - and that door will likely remain open in the future. \nBut, right now, the forward has put sporting ambition ahead of his wallet.\nSalah's a player at the top of his game - those close to the frontman believe he has at least another three years at the highest level.\nThe evidence suggests as much. His physique is optimum and his levels of professionalism are obsessive.\nSalah believes he still has more to accomplish in European football too, starting, of course, with winning Liverpool's 20th league title this season.\nHe has ambitions on winning the Ballon d'Or too, with fifth his highest placing in both 2019 and 2022.\nSalah also wants to win the Champions League again, and ensure Liverpool remain at the pinnacle of English football.\nInterestingly, it is said another one of the key factors in his decision to re-sign was a desire to compete among the elite to help prepare for Egypt's forthcoming World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations campaigns.\nIt's the sporting challenge that has driven his decision for Salah, although the fact his wife Magi and daughters Makka and Kayan are enjoying life on Merseyside has also been described as a key factor too.\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\nGet Liverpool news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Seasonal allergy sufferers are being hit with more pollen over a longer season due to rising temperatures, but global warming is also triggering alarming extreme allergy events, say experts.\nPeople could see the thunderstorm, but they couldn't see what was going on inside it. Trillions of pollen particles, sucked up into the clouds as the storm formed, were now being splintered by rain, lightning and humidity into ever-smaller fragments \u2013 then cast back down to Earth for people to breathe them in.\nIt was around 18:00 on 21 November 2016 when the air in Melbourne, Australia, turned deadly. Emergency service phone lines lit up, people struggling to breathe began flooding into hospitals, and there was so much demand for ambulances that the vehicles were unable to reach patients stuck at home. Emergency rooms saw eight times as many people turning up with breathing problems as they would normally expect. Nearly 10 times as many people with asthma were admitted to hospital.\nIn total, 10 people died, including a 20-year-old law student who passed away on her lawn, waiting for an ambulance while her family tried to resuscitate her. One survivor described how he had been breathing normally and then, within 30 minutes, found himself gasping for air. \"It was insane,\" he told reporters from his hospital bed.\nPaul Beggs, an environmental health scientist and professor at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, remembers the incident well. \"It was an absolutely massive event. Unprecedented. Catastrophic,\" he says. \"The people in Melbourne, the doctors and the nurses and the people in pharmacies \u2013 they all didn't know what was happening.\"\nIt soon became clear that this was a massive case of \"thunderstorm asthma\", which occurs when certain types of storms break up pollen particles in the air, releasing proteins and showering them on unsuspecting people below. The widely dispersed proteins can trigger allergic reactions in some people \u2013 even among those who weren't previously asthmatic.\nThunderstorm asthma events like the one that hit Melbourne are one extreme example of how pollen from plants and the allergies it causes are being dramatically altered by climate change. As temperatures rise, many regions \u2013 especially the US, Europe and Australia \u2013 are seeing seasonal allergies affect an increasing proportion of people, over a longer season and with worse symptoms, say scientists.\nThis year, in the US, pollen levels are predicted to be higher than the historical average across 39 states this season. And that is only likely to get worse in the years to come, experts warn.\nPollen itself is an essential and ever-present part of our world. These microscopic particles pass between plants, enabling them to reproduce. While some plants spread their pollen with the help of insects, others rely on the wind, sending huge volumes of this powdery substance airborne. Many trees, grasses and weed species rely upon wind dispersal for their pollen. It is these that are especially likely to cause seasonal allergies, or hay fever.\nThis occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies the pollen as a harmful substance, triggering a response normally reserved for pathogenic bacteria or viruses. Common symptoms can include a runny nose, itchy eyes and sneezing. In some cases, seasonal allergies can trigger breathing difficulties when inflammation in the airways leads to swelling, making it hard to get enough air into the lungs.\nWhile Melbourne has been the unlucky epicentre of thunderstorm asthma, with seven thunderstorm asthma major events recorded since 1984, similar incidents have occurred around the world, from Birmingham in the UK to Atlanta in the US. Although these are still rare events, climate change may be increasing the likelihood of thunderstorm asthma incidents, in part because it is extending pollen seasons, but also because it is increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, including storms.\nWhile it isn't possible to determine exactly how much climate change influenced the 2016 thunderstorm asthma incident in Melbourne, Beggs is \"reasonably certain\" it had some impact.\n\"We know that climate change is leading to greater amounts of pollen in the atmosphere,\" he says. \"It's changing the seasonality of the pollen. It's changing the types of pollen that we're exposed to.\" Beggs, who has researched thunderstorm asthma extensively, published a paper in 2024 that examined the links between this phenomenon and climate change.\nHow thunderstorms supercharge pollen\nExactly how thunderstorms trigger or exacerbate asthma in this way is still not fully understood. The leading theory is that cold air downdrafts that occur during thunderstorm weather systems generate strong cross winds that blow at ground level, whipping up pollen grains and fungal spores from grass and plants. These then get carried high into the storm system by updrafts, where moisture in the clouds causes them to swell and break apart into smaller fragments, massively increasing the number of allergen particles in the air. The strong electric field that develops during thunderstorms may also enhance the rupture of the pollen.\nThis smaller particle size makes it easier for the pollen fragments to get into the airways as they are carried back to ground-level by cold down-draft winds. Pollen levels seem to spike during the first 20-30 minutes of a thunderstorm, according to studies on the phenomenon. Younger people seem to be particularly affected.\nThankfully, major thunderstorm asthma events remain rare. But climate change is increasing people's risk of pollen exposure in other ways, too.\nFor one thing, rising temperatures mean that pollen seasons \u2013 when plants emit pollen, typically during spring and summer \u2013 are starting earlier and lasting longer, says Elaine Fuertes, a public health scientist who focuses on the environment and allergic disease at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, UK. \"You're going to get people who experience symptoms earlier in the year, for a longer period of time,\" she says.\nIn parts of the world, including the US and Europe, one of the key culprits is ragweed \u2013 a widespread group of flowering plants that many people consider to be weeds. There are various species of ragweed around the world but they can produce mind-bending amounts of pollen. A single plant is capable of emitting one billion pollen grains, for example. Ragweed grows in gardens and farmland but also in nooks and crannies in urban environments.\nAllergies to ragweed pollen already affect some 50 million people in the US alone. A study analysing data from 11 locations in North America between 1995 to 2015 found that 10 of those locations experienced longer ragweed pollen seasons \u2013 sometimes much longer. During that 20-year period, the season lengthened by 25 days in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 21 days in Fargo, North Dakota and 18 days in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\"The winter warms, the springs are starting earlier, and the falls are being delayed, and so the time that you spend outdoors in contact with allergic pollen is definitely going up,\" says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University, in New York, US, and one of the scientists who researched the ragweed pollen season.\nThese changes get more drastic in northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia, Ziska says. But also in Australia and the southern parts of South America and Africa.\nWithout immediate cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, the effect is likely to only get worse. One 2022 study, for example, estimated that, by the end of the century, pollen seasons will begin up to 40 days earlier and end up to 15 days later than they do now \u2013 potentially meaning an additional two months of symptoms for hay fever sufferers per year.\nIt isn't just that people are being exposed to allergens for longer. It is also that the amount of allergens in the air are increasing in many parts of the world. In the 2000s, the pollen season in the continental US started three days earlier than it did during the 1990s, but crucially, the amount of pollen in the air was also 46% higher.\nThis is partly because carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere are rising, due to emissions from human activities. And many of the most bothersome plants for hay fever sufferers thrive on CO2.\nWhen researchers grew a certain type of grass under different CO2 levels, for example, they found that plants grown in an atmosphere containing CO2 at 800 parts per million (ppm) had flowers that produced about 50% more pollen than plants grown in air containing 400ppm. The latter mimics current levels of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere.\nSimilarly, other scientists have also experimented with growing different types of oak tree, the pollen from which often causes hay fever in countries such as South Korea. Under a 720ppm CO2 scenario, they found that each oak tree had an average pollen count 13 times what the trees had under a 400ppm scenario. Even at 560ppm, pollen production was 3.5 times higher than current levels.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Meet Siku, the itchy polar bear with allergies\n\u2022 How light pollution disrupts plants' senses\n\u2022 The science of probiotics and skin\nZiska, who authored the 2022 book Greenhouse Planet, ran similar experiments with ragweed. His results mirror those of other researchers. \"Every time we cranked up the carbon dioxide, the ragweed plants responded. They grew more. They produced more pollen,\" he says. \"And there was some evidence that they were producing a more allergenic form of the pollen, one that could induce your immune system to respond even to a greater extent than had been in the past.\"\nThe spread of invasive species across new parts of the world is also triggering allergic reactions in new populations of people. While originally from North America, ragweed, for example, has spread across Europe, as well as into Australia, Asia and South America. Already, some 60% of people in Hungary, 20% in Denmark and 15% in the Netherlands are reportedly sensitive to the pollen from this prolific group of plants.\nThis makes it especially concerning that, by 2050, the concentration of ragweed pollen in the air is estimated to be about four times what it is today. Even in parts of Europe where ragweed pollen is virtually absent at present, including southern UK and Germany, \"pollen loads become substantial\" under both moderate or high-end climate scenarios, researchers wrote in a 2015 study.\u00a0\nAbout one-third of the increase is due to the continuing spread of the invasive species, the researchers note. The remaining two-thirds is specifically due to climate change, including the lengthening of the growing season as temperatures warm. \"So it'll be an earlier season, a longer season, as well as a more intense season for those who experience allergic symptoms \u2013 and then a higher risk of new sensitisation for a previously unexposed population,\" Fuertes says.\nNot every region in the world will see more pollen production. Some researchers have found that southern California, for example, will experience earlier but less productive pollen seasons, largely as a result of reduced rainfall.\nBut these predictions don't account for all the potential effects of climate change on airborne allergens. There could also be health impacts from the increased likelihood of wildfires, for example, because this raises the risk of both asthma and allergy symptoms.\nRelatively speaking, the amount of pollen in the air will still vary from year to year, Fuertes points out. But that may not be of much help to hay fever sufferers. \"Once you're sensitised and go on to develop allergic symptoms, you'll still likely experience symptoms during years when pollen levels may be lower than average,\" she says. \"You'll react to the pollen that's around.\"\nSo, what can people do about this? Cutting carbon emissions would help to avert some of the worst climate impacts and other strategies might also mitigate the problem.\nIt might be possible to make some drastic but direct interventions, for example. A century ago, some US cities even set up commissions to tackle ragweed. \"Chicago employs 1,350 in hay fever fight,\" blares one headline from 1932. The news story explains that men \u2013 otherwise unemployed during the Great Depression \u2013 were paid the equivalent of one week's food and lodging (and \"25 cents in cash\") for each day they spent cutting down the plant.\nWhile this might sound quaint, it made a difference. A 1956 study of New York City's \"Operation Ragweed\" estimated that cutting down the plant in droves cut pollen production by about 50%. Today, it is in Europe where you can find coordinated action ongoing. In Berlin, workers have been dispatched to find and eliminate ragweed around the city, while Switzerland banned the import or sale of the plant in 2024 and established volunteer groups patrolling public parks to pull it out.\nOther solutions lie in smarter urban design. \"We should definitely green our cities,\" Fuertes says. \"But we do need to do it thoughtfully.\"\nPlanting of exotic species, for example, can trigger new allergies. Opting for the male, pollen producing trees in some species over \"messy\" fruit and seed producing female ones \u2013 so-called \"botanical sexism\" \u2013 can also increase pollen levels in urban areas, although studies have shown the effect of this bias is relatively small in major cities such as New York.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIt is also important to monitor and forecast pollen levels, scientists say. \"We need to know what we're breathing in. That's a pretty fundamental thing in terms of our health,\" says Beggs, who points out that while most people take it for granted that they can get reliable, real-time, validated information on metrics like temperature or rainfall in their area, relatively few can say the same for airborne allergens.\nBut even those services that are modelling pollen counts in an extensive, detailed way \u2013 such as the Finnish Meteorological Institute \u2013 aren't monitoring or modelling airborne allergen levels, which are more accurate as each pollen grain can release different amounts of allergens and they can vary by the weather conditions. These are a different measurement, Fuertes points out, and one that she's shown is more closely linked to allergy symptoms. \"Nobody is measuring allergen levels on a routine basis,\" Fuertes says. \"We should be moving towards that.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\nOverall, experts say, the science is clear. Without concrete, coordinated action, climate change will continue to make hay fever worse across many regions of the world. This might include more dramatic, deadly events like thunderstorm asthma. But it might also mean more people sniffling and suffering, for a longer season, every year.\n\"We have the studies now to show that it's really having an impact on human health,\" says Beggs. \"And there's more to come.\"\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "While on holiday in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last week, there was only one mission on my mind - getting my hands on the viral \"Dubai chocolate\" bar.\nIf you're on TikTok, you will have seen the bar, which combines the flavours of chocolate, pistachio and tahini with filo pastry, and is inspired by the Arab dessert Knafeh.\nThe original, called Can't Get Knafeh of It, by FIX Chocolatier, has been sold exclusively in the UAE since 2022. It become so popular on social media that it's only on sale for two hours a day and often sells out within minutes.\nBut now imitations, known by the nickname \"Dubai chocolate\", have hit UK supermarkets including Waitrose, Lidl and Morrisons, with some supermarkets limiting the number of bars customers are allowed to buy.\nYezen Alani, who co-owns FIX with his wife Sarah Hamouda, told the BBC the global attention Dubai chocolate was getting was \"flattering and humbling\".\nThe FIX chocolate bar was first imagined by Hamouda in 2021, who craved the flavours while she was pregnant.\nAlani and Hamouda started developing the bar a year later, running the business alongside their corporate jobs.\n\"Sarah and I were brought up in the UK and we moved to Dubai 10 years ago, so we've got Western and Arab roots.\n\"We wanted to create flavours that were inspired by that,\" Alani says.\nPart of the appeal of the chocolate is its exclusivity - you can only order it using a food delivery app, rather than walking into a shop or grabbing it at the supermarket.\nIt costs around \u00a315 per bar and can only be bought during specific hours of the day to ensure the company can fulfil all their orders.\nI also saw similar bars sold in many shops in the region, dubbed \"Dubai chocolate\" and adorned with pictures of pistachios and filo pastry.\nAlani says the \"copycat\" bars are \"very frustrating because people are trying knockoffs, which damages our brand\".\nOne of the reasons for the bar's surge in popularity has been social media - with a viral video by TikTok user Maria Vehera  from 2023 being cited as one of the main reasons for its rise to prominence.\nIt shows Vehera trying the Knafeh bar for the first time - along with several others made by the same chocolatier - and has been liked nearly seven million times.\nThe way the bar looks is made for social media -  from the attractive orange and green spots on top of the smooth milk chocolate to the crunch sound it makes when you break off a piece.\nChocolate combined with pistachio isn't new but the real standout element is the crunchy nature of the filling, with the filo pastry adding a texture and thickness to the bar.\nSince the Can't Get Knafeh of It bar is only available in one country, other brands have started to sell their versions in the UK, including Swiss chocolate manufacturer Lindt whose Dubai chocolate is being sold for \u00a310 in supermarkets.\nSince stocking the bar, Waitrose says they've had to introduce a two-bar limit for customers in order to regulate stock levels.\nAnother version has also been sold by Home Bargains, while supermarket Lidl has its own version for \u00a34.99 and is also limiting purchase numbers.\nOne influencer documented how the bar been kept behind tills for this reason.\nHaving tried the Lindt bar and a couple of other versions being sold in corner shops, there is quite a contrast.\nThe FIX chocolate is billed as a \"dessert bar\" and needs to be kept in the fridge, with a short expiry date like many dairy items.\nThis isn't the case for the others, which have been designed to have a longer shelf life.\nYou can also see the difference in taste and texture - the original bar is almost double the width of the Lindt bar, which is more aligned to the size and shape of a standard chocolate bar.\nWhen Alani and Hamouda first started out, they employed one person to fulfil around six to seven orders a day.  \nBut since growing in popularity, primarily thanks to TikTok, their business now employs 50 people, who fulfil 500 orders a day.\nOne big talking point has been the price of the product, which is \u00a315 per bar.\n\"It's all handmade, every single design is done by hand,\" Alani says.\n\"We use premium ingredients and the process is not like making other bars - you've got the baking, moulding the chocolate to the design and with the filling itself, even the pistachios are hand-picked and processed\". \nSpeaking to Arabian Business last year, Hamouda said: \"My mother used to make Knafeh, and that's something I wanted to capture my own way.\n\"Knafeh was the first flavour we perfected. The crunch, the pistachio, it had to be just right,\" she added.\nDespite the product's success, Alani says \"it's been a tough journey\" as the pair have been working together full time while also raising their two children.\n\"There's been times where we've wanted to give up, but we said to ourselves 'we'll keep going as long as we can pay the rent' and now we have no regrets as its worked out\".

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nMcIlroy's dramatic Masters triumph\nHere we go again. That inescapable feeling engulfed Rory McIlroy's fans during a Masters Sunday they wanted to watch through their fingers at certain points.\nA nightmare start saw the nervous 35-year-old from Northern Ireland overhauled by nearest rival Bryson DeChambeau at the top of the leaderboard in a three-shot swing in the opening two holes.\nThen, after recovering to retake a three-shot lead with six holes left, McIlroy threatened to blow his chance yet again.\nThose willing him to win wondered if he was fumbling another golden chance to finally land the prize which had long eluded him.\nThe rollercoaster nature of his triumph, secured eventually at the first play-off hole, was essentially a microcosm of a career which has provided exhilarating highs and devastating lows.\nWhat his supporters had forgotten - understandably given the scar tissue they also had developed from his myriad near misses - was a very different McIlroy had emerged at Augusta National this week.\nA mature McIlroy. A calmer McIlroy. A patient McIlroy.\nMost importantly, perhaps, a McIlroy who has learned how to love himself again on the course after having his heart bitterly broken by the sport he adores.\nMcIlroy beats Rose in Masters play-off to seal career Grand Slam\nI wondered if it would ever be my time - McIlroy\nPodcast: Rory McIlroy completes career Grand Slam with Masters victory\n\"At a certain point in life, someone doesn't want to fall in love because they don't want to get their heart broken,\" the world number two said in an illuminating pre-tournament news conference on Tuesday.\n\"Instinctually as human beings we hold back sometimes because of the fear of getting hurt, whether that's a conscious decision or subconscious decision.\n\"I think once you go through that, once you go through those heartbreaks - as I call them - you get to a place where you remember how it feels.\n\"You wake up the next day and you're like, 'life goes on, it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be'.\"\nMending his forlorn heart has built a resilience which helped McIlroy to execute special shots shortly after tough psychological moments on his path to Masters glory.\nIt has enabled the boy from Holywood to eventually achieve golfing immortality.\nOn Sunday, he roared back again to win the Green Jacket and become only the sixth man in 90 years of the four modern majors to win the career Grand Slam.\nWhat makes his achievement even more remarkable is getting there following a tumultuous 11-year journey since his previous major win.\n\"It was maybe one of the greatest performances ever, with so much pressure on him,\" McIlroy's sports psychologist Bob Rotella told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"What Rory is going to be so proud of is that he found out how unbelievably tough he is.\"\nRory McIlroy finally won the Masters on his 17th appearance at Augusta National - only Spain's 2017 champion Sergio Garcia waited longer\nFrom the moment on Tuesday when McIlroy opened up, you sensed there was something different in his mentality.\nWorking with Rotella - who helped Ireland's Padraig Harrington win three majors - has been a key factor.\nMcIlroy has known the renowned American since 2010 and the conversations between the pair intensified going into his 11th attempt to complete the career Grand Slam.\nMcIlroy said they talked before the tournament about \"trying to chase a feeling\" on the course, rather than \"getting too much into results and outcomes\".\nThe strategy worked perfectly in his opening 14 holes on Thursday. Then a pair of double bogeys dropped him seven shots off the lead.\nMcIlroy scarpered quickly from the course without speaking to the media, saying later he wanted to \"leave what happened\" behind at Augusta National.\nThe fast exit and a Friday morning chat with Rotella helped him bounce back into contention.\nA bogey-free 66, accelerated by five birdies on the second nine, moved him two behind Justin Rose at halfway.\n\"I had a good conversation with Bob, mostly around not pushing too hard too early and trying to get those shots back straight away,\" McIlroy said.\nPatience was also the plan for Saturday.\nMcIlroy and Rotella discussed \"letting the score come\" and not trying to \"force the issue\" as he chased down Rose.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch McIlroy claim his Masters green jacket\nA blistering start to his third round saw McIlroy sink three birdies and an eagle as he became the first player to card threes on each of the opening six holes.\nStill he was stony faced. The solemn expression demonstrated his steely focus and remained throughout another card of 66.\nMcIlroy refused to get carried away with the highs of that round, or too disheartened by a stickier patch around the turn.\n\"I certainly don't want to be a robot out there, but at the same time I don't want to be too animated, either,\" he said.\nMoving into a two-shot advantage over DeChambeau set up Sunday's box-office finale.\nThe contrasting approaches of the final pairing - McIlroy blocking out the noise, DeChambeau feeding off the rising decibels - added an intriguing layer.\nMcIlroy largely maintained his composure in what DeChambeau described as an \"electric\" atmosphere. \"He wouldn't talk to me,\" the maverick American said.\nKeeping his own counsel worked for McIlroy.\n\"Every time he made a mistake he came back and did something fantastic,\" Rotella, who has authored numerous books on sports psychology, said.\n\"It is like he had a will that was made of steel. He kept bouncing back no matter what they threw at him.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy's emotional message to daughter Poppy\nSwitching off from what happens on the course - or, at least, trying to - was another important factor.\nMethods which McIlroy used to zone out included watching racy period drama Bridgerton - which he claimed he was talked into by wife Erica - and Disney animation Zootopia with his four-year-old daughter Poppy.\nPicking up a fictional novel \"for the first time in a long time\" was another. Reading a John Grisham book called The Reckoning proved apt.\nOn the morning of his own day of reckoning, McIlroy spent the hours before his career-defining day watching sport.\nSpanish tennis star Carlos Alcaraz's win at the Monte Carlo Masters was followed by a \"little bit\" of Premier League football and the Formula 1 GP in Bahrain.\n\"I tried to keep myself distracted with other sports,\" he said.\nFamily time also helped McIlroy compartmentalise the day job. After Thursday's bitter blow, he said heading home to see Poppy before bedtime helped him move on.\nThe family took part in the Masters traditional par-three contest on Wednesday alongside McIlroy's close friends Shane Lowry and Tommy Fleetwood, and their wives and children.\nPoppy stole the show by knocking in a 25-foot putt and joined her father again on the 18th green after he secured victory on Sunday.\n\"I'm not going to compare this to life moments like a marriage or having a child,\" said McIlroy.\n\"But it's the best day of my golfing life.\"\nThis video can not be played\nMcIlroy wins Masters play-off to complete career Grand Slam\nWhen 25-year-old McIlroy claimed the fourth major of his career - at the 2014 US PGA Championship - it felt inevitable he would quickly complete the collection at the Masters.\nBack-to-back majors at the Open Championship and US PGA - having previously won the 2011 US Open and 2012 PGA - signalled his dominance.\nA Green Jacket could have already been in the wardrobe, too, but he blew a four-shot lead on a haunting final day in 2011.\nIt sparked a long barren streak at all four majors, with McIlroy's heart crushed most recently at Pinehurst last June.\nThe world number two had charged up the US Open leaderboard to move two shots clear of overnight leader DeChambeau.\nThen, as McIlroy later admitted, he lost focus.\nBogeys on three of his last four holes allowed DeChambeau to snatch a dramatic victory.\nIt was a loss which cut deep. McIlroy fled Pinehurst swiftly, avoiding the media and laying low until the Scottish Open a month later.\n\"Some people have an experience like that and decide they don't want to get there again, it hurts too much,\" said Rotella.\n\"He said he wanted to win majors and could handle losing.\"\nWhile he missed the cut at the blustery Open Championship which followed, the bounce back in 2025 has been impressive.\nA dominant final round from McIlroy led to a two-shot victory at Pebble Beach in February, before he mentally reset to win last month's The Players Championship at Sawgrass in a play-off showdown on the Monday.\nAnd so to Augusta National. The guttural emotion following Sunday's winning putt was McIlroy shedding the weight of burden which had laid heavy.\n\"Every time you get your heart broken you have to bounce back and it makes for a better story \u2013 but you have to have the guts to keep going after it,\" Rotella added.\n\"A lot give up on themselves. I admire the heck out of him because he didn't.\"\nSix key moments that won McIlroy the Masters\nCharting McIlroy's rollercoaster ride to golfing greatness\nMasters recap - McIlroy wins to complete career Grand Slam",

        "article_text": "India is the world's fifth-largest and fastest-growing major economy. \nYet, a recent legacy of protectionism and inward-focused trade policies have held back its global competitiveness.\nIts tariffs are high and the share of global exports remains under 2%. India's vast domestic market has fuelled its growth - outpacing many others, economists argue, largely because the rest of the world is slowing. But in a turbulent, increasingly protectionist era, India's instinct for self-reliance may oddly serve as a short-term shield.\nAs countries scramble to recalibrate in response to shifting US trade policies -  like Donald Trump's latest 90-day tariff pause after weeks of sabre-rattling - India's relative detachment may have helped it weather shocks that have jolted more trade-dependent economies.\n\"India's lower exposure to global goods trade could work in our favour. If export-driven economies slow down under tariff pressure, and we continue growing at 6%, we'll start looking stronger by comparison - especially with our large domestic market to fall back on,\" says Rajeswari Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research.\n\"Being trade-shy has turned into an advantage - but we can't afford complacency. To seize new opportunities, India must stay nimble and open up more to trade gradually and strategically,\" she adds.\nIt may not be easy, given India's long and complicated relationship with trade barriers and tariffs.\nIn his book India's Trade Policy: The 1990s and Beyond, Columbia University economist and noted trade expert Arvind Panagariya traces the complex and often inconsistent evolution of India's approach to trade.\nDuring the inter-war years, industries like textiles and iron and steel lobbied for - and received - high levels of protection. The chronic shortages of World War Two led to even stricter import controls, enforced through an elaborate licensing system. \nWhile Asian peers such as Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore shifted to export-led strategies in the 1960s - and began posting impressive growth rates of 8\u201310% annually - India chose to double down on import substitution. As a result, imports as a share of GDP shrank from 10% in 1957\u201358 to just 4% by 1969\u201370.\nBy the mid-1960s, India had banned imports of consumer goods altogether. This not only removed the pressure on domestic producers to improve quality but also denied them access to world-class inputs and technology.\nAs a result, Indian products lost their competitiveness in global markets and exports stagnated. The resulting foreign exchange shortages led to even tighter import controls, creating a vicious cycle that stifled growth. Between 1951 and 1981, per capita income grew at a sluggish pace of just 1.5% a year.\nThe turning point came in 1991. Faced with a balance-of-payments crisis, India dismantled many import controls and let the rupee depreciate - a move that gave a much-needed boost to exporters and domestic producers competing with imports. Import licensing on consumer goods ended only in 2001, after the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruled against it.\nThe impact was striking: between 2002\u201303 and 2011\u201312, India's exports of goods and services surged six-fold, soaring from $75bn to over $400bn.\nWith trade liberalisation and other reforms, India's per capita income grew more in the first 17 years of the 21st Century than it did throughout the entire 20th Century, notes Prof Panagariya.\nBut the pushback to trade didn't end.\nTrade liberalisation in India was reversed twice - in 1996\u201397 and again since 2018 - with extensive use of anti-dumping measures to block imports from the most competitive sources, according to Prof Panagariya.\n\"Many post-colonial states like India harbour a deep-rooted suspicion that international commerce and trade are simply new forms of colonisation. Unfortunately, this mindset still lingers among some policymakers -  and that's a shame,\" says Vivek Dehejia, a professor of economics at Carleton University in Canada.\nMany economists argue that a decade of protectionist policies has undercut Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make in India initiative, which focused on capital and technology-intensive sectors while sidelining labour-intensive industries like textiles. As a result, the programme has struggled to deliver meaningful gains in manufacturing and exports.\n\"If foreigners cannot sell their goods to us, they will not have the revenues to pay for the goods they buy from us. If we cut back on their goods, they will have to cut back on ours,\" Prof Panagariya wrote.\nSuch protectionism has also led to allegations of cronyism.  \n\"Tariffs have created protectionism in several Indian industries, disincentivising investments in efficiency by cosy incumbents and allowing them to steadily garner market power by building up concentrated positions,\" according to Viral Acharya, a professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business.\nWith the US turning inward and China under pressure, countries belonging to the European Union are scrambling for reliable trade partners - and India could be one of them. To seize this moment, economists believe India must lower its tariffs, boost export competitiveness and signal its openness to global trade.\nSectors like garments, textiles and toys present a golden opportunity, especially for the medium and small-scale sectors. But after a decade of stagnation, the big question is: can they scale up - and will the government back them?\nIf Trump follows through on his tariff plans after the current pause, India could see a $7.76bn - or 6.4% - drop in exports to the US this year, according to an estimate by Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank. (In 2024, India exported $89bn worth of goods to the American market.)\n\"The Trump tariffs are expected to deliver a mild blow to India's merchandise exports to the US,\" says Ajay Srivastava of  GTRI.\nHe emphasises the need for India to broaden its trade base after securing a balanced deal with the US. This includes fast-tracking agreements with the EU, UK and Canada, while deepening ties with China, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Asean.\nAt home, real impact hinges on reforms: simpler tariffs, a smoother goods and services tax (GST), better trade processes and fair implementation of quality controls. Without these, India risks missing the global moment.  \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Pimblett earns biggest win of career\nPaddy Pimblett earned the most significant win of his career with an impressive third-round stoppage of Michael Chandler at UFC 314.\nBriton Pimblett outclassed the American on the feet and the ground for a victory which will move into the top 10 of the lightweight rankings.\nUFC commentator Jon Anik welcomed Pimblett \"to the elite\" after his triumph in Miami, Florida, while the promotion's president Dana White described the 30-year-old as the \"real deal\".\nVictory is Pimblett's seventh since joining the UFC in 2021 - the second-longest win streak in the lightweight division after champion Islam Makhachev's 15.\nPimblett said in the build-up to the contest that, should he beat Chandler, he would be targeting one more win this year before a title shot in 2026.\nIn his post-fight interview Pimblett mentioned a number of fighters he would be interested in fighting, so here's what could be next.\nDominant Pimblett stops Chandler for biggest UFC win\nCharles Oliveira is the fight Pimblett wants the most.\nThe Brazilian is second in the lightweight rankings, a former champion who holds the record for most finishes in the promotion's history with 20.\nPimblett sees the bout as an opportunity to prove himself as the better submission artist.\nOliveira's 16 submission victories is also a UFC record, while Pimblett has made three of his seven UFC opponents tap out.\n\"I want to be a world champion and beating a former champion in Oliveira... he gets called the best submission artist the world has ever seen,\" said Pimblett.\n\"So I'd love to go up against that because I think I've got better submissions than him.\"\nLike Oliveira, Dustin Poirier is a future UFC Hall of Famer, with many regarding him as the best fighter to never win an undisputed title.\nHe beat fellow American Max Holloway for the interim lightweight belt in 2019 but has missed out on the undisputed championship on three occasions.\nThe 36-year-old lost to Khabib Nurmagomedov in 2019, Oliveira in 2021 and Makhachev last year.\nThere has been speculation that Poirier's next fight is likely to be his retirement bout, so the contest could represent a significant occasion for Pimblett.\nLike Poirier, Justin Gaethje is another fine athlete who has never made the last step to winning undisputed gold.\nThe 36-year-old American won the interim belt against Tony Ferguson in 2020 but came up short against Nurmagomedov in 2020 and Oliveira in 2022 when attempting to become champion.\nAlongside Poirier and Oliveria, Pimblett mentioned Gaethje as one of the \"legends\" in the division he wants to test himself against.\n\"These are all names etched in the history of the lightweight division - names people recognise and love - so beating them would be boss,\" said Pimblett.\nFormer featherweight champion Ilia Topuria vacated his belt in February to move up to lightweight.\nThe Georgian-Spaniard has history with Pimblett, with the pair clashing backstage at UFC London in 2022.\nTopuria's rise to the top has been rapid since that altercation, but with Pimblett's win over Chandler and the pair now in the same weight division, a fight is becoming a more realistic prospect.\nAfter his win over Chandler, Pimblett opened the door to a potential future meeting.\n\"I'd love to welcome him to 155lb but apparently he's sitting out and waiting for a title shot,\" said Pimblett.\n\"I'd forgotten about him, that's how irrelevant he is.

        "article_text": "The Indian pot belly - once a badge of prosperity, indulgence and aging respectability - has long been a target of satire and social commentary.\nIn literature, it quietly signalled comfort or complacency; in films, it became a shorthand for the lazy official, gluttonous uncle, or a corrupt policeman. Cartoons exaggerated it to mock politicians. In rural settings, it was once considered a status symbol - a sign that \"this man eats well\".\nBut what was once dismissed or even celebrated is now raising alarm bells. The obesity crisis in India is ballooning - and the seemingly harmless pot belly may be a far bigger villain than we think.\nIndia had the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults in 2021, with 180 million affected - behind only China. A new Lancet study warns this number could soar to 450 million by 2050, nearly a third of the country's projected population. \nGlobally, more than half of all adults and a third of children and adolescents are expected to face the same fate.\nAt the heart of this issue in India lies the pot belly, or in medical terms, abdominal obesity. \nThis form of obesity refers to the accumulation of excess fat around the belly and doctors say it's more than a cosmetic concern. As far back as the 1990s, studies showed a clear link between belly fat and chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\nObesity isn't just abdominal. It appears in different patterns, depending on fat distribution: peripheral obesity affects the hips, thighs, and buttocks, while generalised obesity involves fat spread more evenly across the body.\nThe numbers on abdominal obesity in India are already troubling. According to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) -  which, for the first time, measured waist and hip sizes - about 40% of women and 12% of men in India have abdominal obesity.\nAbdominal obesity, based on Indian guidelines, means a waist over 90cm (35 inches) for men and 80cm (31 inches) for women. Among women aged 30 to 49, nearly one in two already show signs of it. Urban populations were found to be more affected than rural ones, with high waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratios emerging as a key red flag.\nSo why is belly fat such a big deal?\nOne reason is insulin resistance - a condition where the body stops responding properly to insulin, the hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Abdominal fat disrupts how the body uses insulin, making it harder to control blood sugar.\nStudies have found South Asians, including Indians, tend to have more body fat than white Caucasians at the same Body Mass Index. (BMI is a simple measure of body fat based on a person's weight in relation to their height.) \nIt's not just how much fat you have - it's where it goes. In South Asians, fat tends to collect around the trunk and under the skin, but not always deep in the abdomen as visceral fat.\nThough South Asians may have less of the more harmful deep abdominal fat around organs like the liver and pancreas, studies show their larger, less efficient fat cells struggle to store fat under the skin. As a result, excess fat spills into vital organs that regulate metabolism - like the liver and pancreas - raising the risk of diabetes and heart disease.\nScientists still don't fully understand the biological reasons behind the fat distribution patterns. Though numerous genetic studies have been conducted, no single gene has consistently explained this tendency.\nOne theory offers an evolutionary root. India, for centuries, was wracked by famines and chronic food shortages, leaving generations to survive on meagre nutrition.\nIn such conditions, the human body adapted for survival in extreme scarcity.\nThe body needed a depot for this energy and the abdomen, being the most expandable area, became the prime storage site. Over time, as food became more plentiful, this fat store continued to grow -  eventually to harmful levels.\n\"It's a conjectural but plausible evolutionary theory - one that can't be proven, but makes sense,\" says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology.\nLast year, in a paper doctors belonging to the Indian Obesity Commission redefined obesity guidelines for Asian Indians, moving beyond BMI to better reflect how body fat relates to early health risks.\nThey created a two-stage clinical system that considers fat distribution, related diseases and physical function.\nStage one involves a high BMI, but without abdominal obesity, metabolic disease, or physical dysfunction. In such cases, lifestyle changes like diet, exercise and sometimes medication are usually enough.\nStage two includes abdominal obesity - the harmful visceral fat -  and is often accompanied by health issues like diabetes, knee pain or palpitations. This stage signals higher risk and calls for more intensive management.\nThis classification guides treatment intensity. Once belly fat appears, early action is key - new weight loss drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide are proving effective at targeting it, doctors say.\n\"As shocking as it may sound, even people with a normal weight can have dangerous levels of belly fat,\" says Dr Misra.\nIndian physicians say abdominal obesity is rising due to lifestyle changes - more junk food, takeaways, instant meals and greasy home cooking. Between 2009 and 2019, Cameroon, India and Vietnam saw the fastest growth in per capita sales of ultra-processed foods and beverages, studies found. \nSo, what needs to be done?\nExperts say Indians need tougher lifestyle changes than Western norms recommend. While 150 minutes of weekly exercise may suffice for their European men, their South Asians counterparts need around 250\u2013300 minutes to offset slower metabolism and less efficient fat storage, studies show. \n\"Our bodies simply aren't as good at handling excess fat,\" says Dr Misra.\nIn short, the pot belly isn't just a punchline - it's a warning sign. And India is sitting on a ticking health time bomb.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There's no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles.\nAnd as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don't get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn't chocolate. It's made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans.\nThe selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring.\n\"The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,\" says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. \"In January just gone, it's shot up by 14%.\"\nThat's the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa \u2013 which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans \u2013 has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024. \n\"I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now \u2013 I don't remember a big story like this on costs going up,\" adds Mr Caines.\nA key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa.\nPlus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports.\nIt means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year.\nReal chocolate could become a \"luxury\" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba.\nThe company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks.\nCarob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however \u2013 and not a very happy one.\nA New Yorker article claims a generation was \"traumatized\" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently.\nBut Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob \"really doesn't taste like chocolate\" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa.\nTheir carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains.\nThere could be health benefits to this. \"We can reduce drastically the sugar content,\" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa.\nGerman food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices.\nUnlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva.\n\"We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,\" explains Dr Marquart. \"It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market.\"\nChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France \u2013 though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva.\nWhen I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm.\nI note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty.\nThe company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try \u2013 the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating.\nOverall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate.\nA UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture.\n\"We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,\" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally \u2013 to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans.\n\"There's around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,\" says Mr Newton.\nIt's early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year.\nMr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company's product manages to include 24 of them \u2013 though in some cases at slightly different concentrations.\nThe company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you'd expect, and very satisfying to chew.\n\"Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,\" says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat.\nHe adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products \u2013 such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: \"The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable.\"\nShould chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University.\n\"It's something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,\" she says. Cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world.\nNukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don't aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls.\nDr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees.\nPoor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a study published in February.\nBy shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years.",

        "article_text": "A trial in the landmark antitrust case against social media giant Meta kicks off in Washington on Monday.\nThe US competition and consumer watchdog alleges that Meta, which already owned Facebook, bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to eliminate competition, effectively giving itself a monopoly.\nThe FTC reviewed and approved those acquisitions but committed to monitor the outcomes. If the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) wins the case it could force Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to sell off both Instagram and WhatsApp.\nMeta previously said it was sure it would win and experts have told the BBC it is likely to argue that Instagram users have had a better experience since it was taken over.\n\"The [FTC's] argument is the acquisition of Instagram was a way of neutralizing this rising competitive threat to Facebook,\" says Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor of antitrust at Vanderbilt Law School.\nMs Allensworth says Mr Zuckerberg's own words, including those from his emails, may offer the most convincing evidence at trial.\n\"He said it's better to buy than to compete. It's hard to get more literal than that,\" Ms Allensworth says.\nMeta, on the other hand, is likely to argue that intent is not particularly relevant in an antitrust case.\n\"They're going to say the real question is: are consumers better off as a result of this merger?,\" she said. \"They'll put on a lot of evidence that Instagram became what it is today because it benefited from being owned by Facebook.\"\nMr Zuckerberg and the company's former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg are both expected to testify at the trial, which could run for several weeks.\nThe case, FTC v Meta, was filed during US President Donald Trump's first administration but risks becoming politicized during his second term.\nMr Zuckerberg has lobbied Trump in person to have the FTC drop the case, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nWhen asked by the BBC to confirm that report, Meta sidestepped the question but said in a statement: \"The FTC's lawsuits against Meta defies reality.\"\n\"More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" a Meta spokesperson told the BBC.\nRelations between Mr Zuckerberg and Trump had been frosty partly because Trump was barred from Meta's social media platforms after the US Capitol riot in January 2021.\nSince then, the relationship has thawed somewhat.\nMeta contributed $1m (\u00a3764,400) to Trump's inaugural fund, and in January announced Ultimate Fighting Championship Fighter (UFC) boss Dana White, a close Trump ally, would join its board of directors.\nThe company also announced in January that it was doing away with independent fact-checkers.\n\nPresident Trump's move to fire two FTC commissioners in March also hangs over the case.\nAs Democrats, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya were in the minority on the five-seat commission.\nUntil Wednesday, just two seats of those seats were filled, both by Republicans. Another Republican was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday.\nSlaughter and Bedoya - who are suing the Trump administration to be reinstated - say the move to push them out was meant to intimidate.\n\"The president sent a very clear signal not only to us but to Chairman Ferguson and Commissioner [Melissa] Holyoak that if they do something he doesn't like, he could fire them too,\" Slaughter told the BBC in a recent interview.\n\"So if they don't want to do a favor for his political allies, they're on the chopping block as well,\" Slaughter said.\nSlaughter and Bedoya both expressed alarm at recent reports about Zuckerberg's lobbying efforts. \n\"My hope is that there is no political interference,\" Mr Bedoya told the BBC.\nThe FTC did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nFerguson, who was appointed as FTC chair by Trump, recently told The Verge he would \"obey lawful orders\" when asked what he would do if the president directed him to drop a lawsuit like the one against Meta. \nFerguson added that he would be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\nThe FTC is considered a key antitrust watchdog. In recent years, it has returned hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of fraud, in addition to passing laws that ban junk fees and subscription traps.\nBut as the Meta trial begins, it's among the many independent regulatory agencies that the administration seems keen to rein in.\nChair Ferguson is also recently quoted reaffirming his belief that independent regulatory bodies are \"not good for democracy.\"\n\nFTC v Meta begins as another major antitrust case - USA v Google - enters what's known as the remedies phase.\nThe Department of Justice won the first phase of that case last summer when Judge Amit Mehta found that Google holds a monopoly in online search, with a market share of around 90%.\nLast month, the DOJ reiterated a demand made during the Biden administration that a court break up Google's search monopoly.\nThe FTC's case against Meta will be tougher to prove, says Laura Phillips-Sawyer, an associate professor of business law at the University of Georgia.\n\"I think they have a real uphill battle,\" Ms Phillips-Sawyer said of the FTC.\n\"They have a long road before any consideration of divestiture of Instagram or WhatsApp is considered.\"\nThat's because compared to online search, there's more competition in the personal network services space that Meta operates in, Ms Phillips-Sawyer said.\nMeta in a statement said the evidence at trial \"will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",

So how does it work? We have already seen SAOT in this season's Champions League and in the FA Cup from the fifth round onwards.When a tight offside decision goes to a VAR review, SAOT steps in.Previously, officials in the VAR room needed to decide on three key things - when the ball was kicked, where and at what angle the defender's body was when the ball was kicked and where and what angle the attacker's body was at the moment of contact.Viewers at home have seen this manual process played out with lines drawn with crosshairs on freeze-frame replays shown on their TV screens.All three of those decisions will now be automatically taken by the technology to remove some elements of human subjectivity, such as which frame to freeze as the ball is kicked.Bespoke cameras have been installed beneath the roof at all 20 Premier League stadiums to monitor a variety of key elements.About 30 cameras - working at 100 frames per second - will track the exact movement of the ball as well as 10,000 data points on the bodies of all 22 players.It means it can be automatically determined whether an attacking player's body was beyond the last defender at the exact time the ball was played.VAR officials check the system has correctly determined the three key points it measures before confirming the decision. The on-field officials then inform the players.A 3D animation of the decision produced by the artificial intelligence will then be played on television for viewers at home and on big screens in the stadium.As yet, the officials will not speak to the crowd, as has been seen in the Carabao Cup.Will it end the lengthy delays?Image source, The FAImage caption, We've already seen SAOT working in the FA Cup and Champions League this seasonIn short, a little.But it's important to remember we are only talking about offside decisions here - which are largely factual - and not subjective refereeing calls on goals, penalties and red cards, which will still go to VAR.SAOT will increase the speed of the virtual offside line placements and it will help in crowded penalty areas.The delay in disallowing Moises Caicedo's goal in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Tottenham was about four minutes, and there is confidence SAOT would have cut that wait by about two minutes.But it would not have reduced the time - more than three minutes - that it took to disallow Pape Sarr's goal in the same game which led to Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou claiming that VAR was \"killing the game\". That goal was ruled out for a foul that was spotted in midfield, rather than for an offside.The Premier League says there has already been 100% accuracy with offsides this season, with the average VAR delay at 39 seconds per game, compared with 64 seconds last season.Ultimately, SAOT will reduce, but not eliminate, VAR delays for complex situations.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Six minutes to come to a clear & obvious decision - Ange on VAR 'lottery'What was learned from eight-minute delay at Bournemouth?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Milos Kerkez's goal was eventually disallowed after a record VAR delay In Bournemouth's FA Cup fifth-round win over Wolves - one of the 'trial' games - SAOT made the headlines after a record eight-minute VAR stoppage.The officials were unable to rely on the new technology during the check, and they needed to revert to manually drawn lines before disallowing Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez's 35th-minute goal.The Football Association said the issue was caused by a congested penalty area.It was reviewed and it was recognised the speed of the process and switching between technologies - AI and data platform Genius Sports supply the SAOT - could have been improved.It was felt some time could have been saved before recognising the new technology was not going to be able to help in that situation.There are no plans for a time cut-off for VAR checks, despite recent criticism.The argument from referees' body PGMOL is that it can sometimes take time for officials to check through multiple issues with multiple processes - the last of which may be decisive but fall out of any time limit, should one be imposed.Related topicsPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyWhy did Bournemouth VAR check take eight minutes?Published1 MarchReferees to wear bodycams at Club World CupPublished2 days ago'I was a Premier League referee, but now I'm learning to walk again'Published3 AprilHow much are Premier League referees paid?Published4 days ago",

        "article_text": "Since joining Manchester United in summer 2023, Andre Onana has made more mistakes in all competitions than any other Premier League goalkeeper\nWar of the words, power of the press conference. In what felt like a trade of verbal blows from a bygone era, Lyon midfielder Nemanja Matic's jibe that Andre Onana is \"one of the worst goalkeepers\" in Manchester United history set the tone for Thursday's Europa League meeting.\nOnana was then at fault for both Lyon's goals in his side's 2-2 draw in the quarter-final first leg - just a day after those comments from former Red Devils player Matic.\nIt means that since the start of last season, Onana has made eight errors leading to goals in all competitions, the most of any keeper playing for a Premier League club.\nBoss Ruben Amorim looked to take the spotlight off his goalkeeper by suggesting he is the one who has made more mistakes than his players this season. \nBut there is no avoiding the questions - did Matic's comments affect Onana's performance on Thursday night? Was playing mind games his intention all along? And how does Onana rebuild his confidence before facing Lyon again next week?\n\"If you get another high-profile player who comes out with a comment like that, despite how much shielding they do, he is going to know it,\" says chartered psychologist Dr Simon Moore.\n\"They're all on social media, they have all got phones and he is not going to be able to avoid it. It will get in his head, because no matter how hard he tries to park it and move on, it will bug him.\n\"The other thing is, you get this reaction of 'well I am going to go out and show everybody that I don't make mistakes and I am over it'. And that puts even more pressure and duress on you to achieve that.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'One of the worst keepers in Man Utd history' - Matic on Onana\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, Matic was asked about Onana's comments from earlier this week that United were \"way better\" than French club Lyon.\nSerbian Matic, who played for United from 2017-2022, responded: \"You know, I respect everyone but to say that then you need to give the answer.\n\"If you are one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's history, you need to take care what you're talking about.\n\"If it was [Edwin] Van der Sar, [Peter] Schmeichel or [David] De Gea saying that, then I would question myself. But you need to have cover to say something like that.\"\nOnana then posted on social media to deny he was being disrespectful.\n\"I would never be disrespectful to another club. We know that tomorrow will be a difficult game against a strong opponent,\" Onana said on X.\n\"We focus on preparing a performance to make our fans proud.\n\"At least I've lifted trophies with the greatest club in the world. Some can't say the same.\"\nThis video can not be played\nOnana given vote of confidence by Amorim after errors\n\"He was in the headlines before the game and now he is going to be all over the headlines again,\" said former England winger Aaron Lennon on BBC Radio 5 Live following Onana's errors against Lyon. \n\"I think he looks a bit silly tonight and Matic is probably the one who is going to sleep well,\" added former Lyon and England midfielder Izzy Christiansen.\nMoore, who co-hosts the What's Your Goal podcast alongside former England midfielder Katie Chapman, says the brain is wired to pay specific attention to risk, threat and mistakes from an \"ego, status and reputation point of view\".\n\"Given the fact he is a goalkeeper at a very famous club and there is a lot of pressure on shoulders anyway within that team, they have had a lot of negative media throughout the year, he is going to have a double whammy effect,\" Moore says.\n\"What you are doing is signalling to your brain, rather than 'how can I do well?', is 'how can I avoid a mistake?'.\"\nMatt Shaw is a chartered sports psychologist at InnerDrive, who work with players from senior internationals to academy level.\n\"We often talk about external noise and trying to limit it as much as possible,\" says Shaw. \"In some sense, it could be a coincidence those comments were made and then he had a poor performance.\n\"You might look at other times this season where no comments were made and he had good or bad performances after that as well.\"\nShaw says what is being said off the pitch can often be \"overhyped\" because of its importance to fans and the media, rather than the players themselves.\n\"A lot of these guys, it is water off a duck's back,\" he explains. \"When it does impact players it's really interesting, because we often forget they are experts in what they do - experts can have poor performance - but also in terms of how they handle those situations.\n\"You see Onana pre-match going straight up to the fans in front of the net, where it looked like it didn't really affect him at all. It can affect these guys, but often it doesn't.\n\"When we are working with players, we are working with them all the time and trying to keep them at a baseline. It is easy to draw a straight line and say lots of stuff happened pre-match and he went on to make mistakes that led to goals. Whereas the chances are, once the game starts, it is very unlikely that is in his mind because he has way more to focus on.\n\"What we always want is players thinking in a helpful way, what do they need to think about and focus in order to perform well? Obviously comments beforehand about being United's poorest goalkeeper aren't the comments we want him thinking about. But I would be surprised if those were in his mind.\"\n'I've made more mistakes than them' - Amorim defends Onana after errors\nHow does Onana compare to other Man Utd keepers after Matic criticism?\nSo what can Onana, and United's backroom staff, do to help focus him going forward?\n\"I would remind him of all the positive things he's been doing, bombard him with all the clips,\" says Moore. \"He's a great stopper, his reflexes are amazing, so remind him.\n\"That will give him confidence, and then maybe play the clips back and say these are areas we need to work on.\n\"Football is a creative sport, that is great for the fan because you get lots of exciting moments, but creativity also means you are going to fail a lot - that is the nature of creativity. He has got to accept he is an industry that oscillates between 'wow' moments and moments you make mistakes.\"\nShaw says, after a debrief, it is about focusing on the action plan going forwards.\n\"And then it's about going into training and practising those things or stripping it all the way back to 'OK, what am I good at? What is the part of the game that makes me who I am as a goalkeeper?' and just focusing on those things instead,\" he adds.\nThe one-week turnaround before facing Lyon in the second leg may seem tight, but Shaw says in football terms that is plenty of time to move on - and Manchester United have another game, at Newcastle on Sunday, to think about first anyway.\n\"The goalkeeper team will be quite tight,\" he adds.\n\"They will be getting around him and then really going back to what they enjoy doing in training and just trying to make sure he is successful in training so it builds some confidence over the course of the week, as well as having those conversations about what we do differently next time.\n\"In any of our walks of life, if something goes wrong, we expect people to get around us, having a little bit of a debrief with a focus on being better next time as opposed to not being good enough - then really just focusing on the things that make him a good goalkeeper and trying to expose those throughout the week.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

On Sunday the group said it had taken control of Zamzam but denied reports of atrocities.\nThe camps, Zamzam and Abu Shouk, provide temporary homes to more than 700,000 people, many of whom are facing famine-like conditions.\nNews of the attacks comes on the eve of the second anniversary of the start of the civil war between the RSF and the army.\nContacting the BBC on Sunday morning, one Zamzam resident who works at a community kitchen providing food for those in the camp, said \"a large number of young people\" had been killed.\n\"Those who were working in the community kitchen have been killed, and the doctors who were part of the initiative to reopen the hospital were also killed,\" Mustafa, 34, said in a WhatsApp audio message.\n\"My uncle and my cousin were killed. People are wounded, and there is no medicine or hospital to save them - they are dying from bleeding.\n\"The shelling is still ongoing, and we are expecting more attacks in the morning.\"\nHe added that all routes out of the camp were closed and it was \"surrounded from all four directions\".\nAnother resident, Wasir, said that \"nothing [was] left in Zamzam\".\n\"A large number of civilians have fled, and we are still trying to leave, but we haven't succeeded, all the roads are blocked, and we have children with us.\n\"Death is everywhere. As I speak to you now from inside the trench, there is shelling happening.\"\nSome camp residents have got out and made the 15km (nine mile) journey to el-Fasher, according to North Darfur's Health Minister Ibrahim Khater.\n\"I am observing many people walking from Zamzam - mostly children, women and the elderly,\" he said in a message to the BBC.\n\"Some were injured, tired and saying they lost their family - dead on the streets. The situation is catastrophic.\"\nThe UN's humanitarian co-ordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, said she was \"appalled and gravely alarmed\" by reports from Darfur.\n\"This represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers,\" she added in a statement.\nThe US State Department also said it was \"deeply alarmed by reports of attacks by the RSF on Zamzam and Abu Shouk\", adding: \"We condemn the RSF's attacks on the most vulnerable of civilians.\"\nBritish Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who is hosting a conference on Sudan on Tuesday, described the reports of \"indiscriminate RSF attacks\" as \"shocking\".\nAid organisation Relief International said nine of its workers \"were mercilessly killed including doctors, referral drivers and a team leader\" in the attack on Zamzam.\nThe charity, which said it was the last provider of critical health services in the camp, alleged RSF fighters were to blame.\n\"We understand that this was a targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region to prevent access to healthcare for internally displaced people.\n\"We are horrified that one of our clinics was also part of this attack - along with other health facilities in el-Fasher.\"\nKashif Shafique, the charity's Sudan director, told the BBC's Newshour programme that what happened was not random. \nRelaying what two surviving female members of staff had described, he said RSF fighters went into a safety bunker and shot the nine victims in the head and chest.\nIn a statement released on Saturday, the RSF said it was not responsible for attacks on civilians and that scenes of killing in Zamzam were staged to discredit its forces.\nThe following day, the group said it had completed a \"successful liberation\" of the camp from Sudan's army. The RSF accused the army of using Zamzam as \"a military barracks, and innocent civilians as human shields\".\nAssessing satellite images, a team of specialists at Yale University in the US said on Friday that \"this attack conservatively represents the most significant ground-based attack on Zamzam... since fighting erupted in the el-Fasher area in spring of 2024\".\nThe Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab said it had observed that \"arson attacks have burned multiple structures and significant areas of the camp in the center, south, and southeast portions of the camp\".\nThe war - a power struggle between the army and the RSF - has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, forcing more than 12 million people from their homes and pushing communities into hunger.\nIt began on 15 April 2023, after the leaders of the army and RSF fell out over the political future of the country.\nEl-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for a year.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

The RSF accused the army of using Zamzam as \"a military barracks, and innocent civilians as human shields\".Assessing satellite images, a team of specialists at Yale University in the US said on Friday that \"this attack conservatively represents the most significant ground-based attack on Zamzam... since fighting erupted in the el-Fasher area in spring of 2024\".The Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab said it had observed that \"arson attacks have burned multiple structures and significant areas of the camp in the center, south, and southeast portions of the camp\".The war - a power struggle between the army and the RSF - has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, forcing more than 12 million people from their homes and pushing communities into hunger.It began on 15 April 2023, after the leaders of the army and RSF fell out over the political future of the country.El-Fasher is the last major town in Darfur under army control and has been under siege by the RSF for a year.More BBC stories on Sudan:The children living between starvation and death in DarfurCivil war survivors tell of killings and rapesThousands flee fresh ethnic killings in Darfur'I saw bodies dumped in Darfur mass grave'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsAfrica DailyFocus on AfricaSudanAfrica \"This represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers,\" she added in a statement.The US State Department also said it was \"deeply alarmed by reports of attacks by the RSF on Zamzam and Abu Shouk\", adding: \"We condemn the RSF's attacks on the most vulnerable of civilians. \"British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who is hosting a conference on Sudan on Tuesday, described the reports of \"indiscriminate RSF attacks\" as \"shocking\".Aid organisation Relief International said nine of its workers \"were mercilessly killed including doctors, referral drivers and a team leader\" in the attack on Zamzam.The charity, which said it was the last provider of critical health services in the camp, alleged RSF fighters were to blame.",

        "article_text": "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.\nThe agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.\nThe deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.\nSmall island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".\nShipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.\nBut the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.\nThe agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting. \nIt will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.\nAlthough the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.\nThe vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.\nAlthough they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.\nThere have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships. \nThe most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.\n\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment. \n\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.\nIn comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.\nFigures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce. \n\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.\nSome island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped. \n\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.\nTheir disappointment was shared by environmental groups.\n\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.\nIt is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.\nBut China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal. \nJesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.\n\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.\nFahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.\n\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.\nAny money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries. \nIt is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken. \nAlthough the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. \nBut industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations. \nThe US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.\nNow the committee have agreed the measure, it is expected to be formally adopted in October.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "article_text": "Donald Trump announced a massive tariff plan last week that would have upended the global economic order as well as long-established trading relationships with America's allies. \nBut that plan - or at least a significant part of it - is on ice after the president suspended higher tariffs on most countries for 90 days while leaning into a trade war with China.\nSo with this partial reversal, is Trump any closer to realising his goals on trade? Here's a quick look at five of his key ambitions and where they now stand.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike\nTrump's original trade plan packed a big punch that landed around the world, with a flat 10% baseline tariff on everyone (including some uninhabited islands) and additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on the 60 counties that he said were the worst offenders.\nIt sent allies and adversaries scrambling, as they stared down the prospect of a debilitating blow to their economies.\nThe White House has been quick to boast about all the world leaders who have reached out to the president to make deals and offer trade concessions \u2013 \"more than 75\", according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nAlthough the administration hasn't released a list of all the countries that Trump said on Tuesday were \"kissing my ass\" and promising to do anything, the US has announced it is in negotiations with South Korea and Japan, among others.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: America's trading partners have 90 days to strike some sort of agreement with Trump, and the clock is ticking. But the fact that talks are happening indicates that the president has a good chance of getting something for his efforts.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country\u2026We will supercharge our domestic industrial base.\nTrump has said for decades that tariffs are an effective way of rebuilding America's manufacturing base by shielding it from unfair foreign competition. While some factories may be able to increase production in current facilities, more substantive efforts take time. And for business leaders to pull the trigger on \"reshoring\" their production lines and investing in new US factories, they will want to know that the rules of the game are relatively stable.\nThe president's on-again, off-again tariff moves over the past week are inherently unstable, however. For the moment, it's difficult to predict where the final tariff levels will land and which industries will receive the greatest protections. It could be car manufacturers and steel producers today, and high-tech electronics companies tomorrow.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: When tariffs are applied and removed seemingly at the president's whim, it's much more likely that companies \u2013 both in the US and abroad \u2013 will hunker down and wait for the dust to settle before making any big commitments.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: I have great respect for President Xi of China, great respect for China, but they were taking tremendous advantage of us.\nAfter Trump's tariff about-face on Wednesday, several White House officials \u2013 including Treasury Secretary Bessent - were quick to say that Trump's goal was to drop the hammer on the real villain, China.\n\"They are the biggest source of the US trade problems,\" Bessent told reporters, \"and indeed they are the problem for the rest of the world.\nIf Trump wanted a battle of wills with China, testing each side's tolerance for economic and political pain, he got one \u2013 even if the president and his aides have hinted that they are looking for an exit ramp.\nOn Wednesday, Trump said that he blamed past US leaders, not China, for the current trade dispute. The prior day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president would be \"incredibly gracious\" if China reaches out to make a deal.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: Even if this showdown is one Trump wants, picking a fight with the second-largest economy in the world, with military power to match, comes at enormous risk. And along the way America may have alienated the allies it needs most in such a confrontation.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Now it's our turn to prosper, and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it'll all happen very quickly.\nDuring last year's presidential campaign, Trump regularly touted that his proposed tariffs would bring in vast sums in new revenue, which the US could then use to shrink its budget deficit, fund tax cuts and pay for new government programmes.\nA study last year by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff \u2013 which is what Trump has landed on for at least the next 90 days \u2013 would generate $2tn in new revenue over the next 10 years.\nTo put that in context, the tax cuts Congress recently included in its non-binding budget blueprint would cost approximately $5tn over the next 10 years, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: Trump wanted more tariff revenue, and if he sticks with his baseline tariffs, plus the additional levies on certain imports and larger ones on China, he's going to get it \u2013 at least until Americans switch to more domestic production, when the tariff money gusher could turn to a trickle.\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. This will be indeed the golden age of America.\nAnalysts and experts have offered a grab bag of other explanations about why Trump made such an aggressive move on trade last week. Was he trying to drive down interest rates, or devalue the US dollar or bring the world to the table for a new, global agreement on trade? The president himself hasn't spoken much about those kinds of elaborate schemes.\nOne thing he has talked about relentlessly, however, is his desire to lower costs for American consumers - and he has promised that his trade policy will help address this. While energy prices dipped in the week since Trump announced his tariff plan, that may have been a result of fears that the trade wars could trigger a global recession. \nThe consensus among economists is that new tariffs will drive up consumer prices, as tariffs are tacked on to the price of imports and, eventually, when there is less competition for US-made products. Last year, the Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff would increase costs for American households by an average of $1,253 in its first year. Economists also warn that lower-income Americans will be hardest hit. \nTHE TAKEAWAY: An increase in prices is an arrow moving in the wrong direction \u2013 and it represents an enormous potential liability for both Trump's political standing and his party's future electoral prospects.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "A new Universal theme park near Bedford - the first in Europe - was announced to much fanfare earlier this week.\nSet to open in 2031, construction is to begin at the 476-acre (1.9-sq-km) site, where attractions are likely to feature James Bond, Paddington and The Lord of the Rings. \nBut from deciding how many loops to include on a coaster, to making sure even the trees blend in seamlessly with an area's design, building a dream world is a painstaking task. \nTo find out what planning lies behind the thrills, and what sort of things we could expect when the new Universal park finally arrives, BBC News spoke to some rollercoaster experts.\nOf course, any good theme park needs some good rides - but maybe it's an understatement to say that's a tall order.\nWhile \"at least two or three iconic rides\" are needed, these need not necessarily be the fastest, tallest or most innovative to stand out, explains Andy Sinclair-Harris, creative director at Katapult, which has designed attractions for the likes of Legoland and Alton Towers.\n\"What is more important is the depth of storytelling,\" he says, so that you're fully immersed in the experience of the ride.\nA good example, says Robbie Jones, insights director at Katapult, is a Harry-Potter-themed rollercoaster called Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, located at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal's Orlando resort. Riders sit in replicas of Hagrid's motorbike and zoom through recreations of settings from the popular film series.\n\"There's nothing particularly brand new or absolutely amazing about that ride, other than it tells a story amazingly well,\" he adds.\nIf the rumours that there's going to be a Back to the Future ride at Universal's UK venture are true, those behind it will be ensuring that the DeLorean time machine is included, he says.\nDuring the brainstorming stage of building a resort, rides are often \"developed as storytelling tools\" in a \"specific genre or world\", says Joseph Bright, CEO at Scruffy Dog, which provides creative project management for theme parks.\nWhile an iconic ride might help to \"anchor\" a zone of a park, \"it's never developed in isolation\" - rather \"cohesion is critical [and] every element... must serve the wider guest story\".\nDennis Speigel, founder of International Theme Park Services, says meticulous planning goes into the most immersive rides.\nHe adds that the size of a rollercoaster is partly dictated by the number of guests its designers hope to get on board - \"between 1,500 and 2,000 an hour\" at popular parks.\nUsually, that means a coaster that is over 3,000ft (914m) long, with the first dip \"somewhere in the 150ft (45m) range\".\nMr Speigel says that while an upcoming coaster at Six Flags Qiddiya in Saudi Arabia is set to break records when it sends riders speeding at over 150mph (240 km/h) around the tracks, most coasters today reach between 70-90mph (110-145 km/h) on their first drop.  \nOnce the larger rides are planned out, theme park designers then consider what he describes as \"flat rides\", which cater to less thrill-seeking crowds.\n\"Those are your smaller rides that take people around and around, like a merry-go-round or a monster,\" he says. \"[They're] rides that can often be bought off the shelf from a manufacturer.\"\nWhen you step foot in a theme park, you're probably thinking about the rides you'll be going on - but you might think less about how you get there.\nDuring the design phase, you have to let your imagination run wild, says Mr Sinclair-Harris. \"Budget is a thing, but when you have those first initial discussions, you shouldn't be tempered by anything,\" he says.\nThe \"story\" of your park is crucial, he adds. \"It's knowing the story, the characters and being true to that world.\"\nDiscussions about potential ride dimensions and manufacturers soon follow, as well as a masterplan, which configures how attractions, pathways and amenities all fit into the space. It often determines how long people will end up queuing for.\nAn artist's conception of the Universal UK park depicts a huge lake in middle of what appears to be different themed areas. Far from just looking pretty, it can allow crowds to fan out to multiple rides without congestion forming around one.\nAlton Towers has a lake too. Theme park vlogger and fanatic Charlotte Branford - known as Diary of a RollerCoaster Girl - believes it means other visitors often choose to go left around it (to the Wicker Man ride), or right around it (towards the Smiler). She heads to the back of the park to try to avoid the crowds.\nAt the back of parks designed in this way you'll often find a show with set times \"to try and stop people running around to the back of the park to get to some big attraction\", says Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club, who has been involved in rollercoaster designs.\n\"Without realising it, they're trying to make you do roughly what they want you to do when you're in the park.\"\nAnother tried and tested layout is the \"hub and spoke\" often seen at Disneyland resorts, says Mr Sinclair-Harris.\n\"In a sense you've got that central gathering point... like the castle in the Magic Kingdom... with different lands like spokes on a wheel, radiating out.\"\nUniversal's new Epic Universe theme park in Orlando will follow a version of this - allowing you to venture into different lands through portals.\nSo the stories behind the rollercoasters are intertwined with the story of the theme park layout itself.\nThen come the finishing touches - to maintain your sense of being in a futuristic or fantasy world while you're there.\nTrees, artificial rock or even other buildings are often used to obscure unsightly but necessary objects, Mr Sinclair-Harris says. \"If you're in an amazing world with castles and dragons, seeing a telephone pole removes you from that story\".\nEven the audio playing out, scent of a park and queue lines are considered because they \"play a role in that illusion,\" says Mr Bright.\nAs Mr Garvanovic puts it, \"there's tons of subtle stuff going on in the background\" in a well thought-out theme park.\nThe sign of success, perhaps, is when you barely even notice it.",

        "article_text": "On an unusually crisp April day in a rural Texas town, dozens of Mennonite community members gathered alongside the nation's top health official, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to mourn the death of an eight-year-old.\nDaisy Hildebrand is the second unvaccinated girl from the community to die from measles in two months.\nOfficials in Seminole town also joined the reception after her funeral to support the family, said South Plains Public Health Director Zach Holbrooks. This time, there was no talk of the vaccine that prevents measles deaths - unlike many of his long days since the outbreak began.\n\"The focus was on their healing,\" Mr Holbrooks said. \"You never want to see anybody pass away, especially a child that young, from any kind of illness, because there is a prevention for it - the MMR vaccine.\"\nLike other Seminole natives, Mr Holbrooks was not vaccinated against measles as a child. He got a shot in college, and another in February, when his hometown became the epicentre of one of the country's worst measles outbreaks in a decade.\nThe US has seen more than 700 cases this year, a sharp rise on the 285 cases reported in 2024. The majority of infections - 541 as of Friday - occurred in western Texas, with 56 patients sent to the hospital. \nCases in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas also are linked to the outbreak. Two children, including Daisy, have died - the first recorded fatalities from measles in the US since 2015.\nIt's not slowing down either, public health experts say. They try to reach vaccine-hesitant residents, but struggle with those who carry on with daily life as usual, alongside mixed messaging from federal officials, including Kennedy, who has endorsed immunisation conspiracy theories in the past.\n\"I wish there were more coming in to get the vaccine,\" Mr Holbrooks said. \"We can put messaging out, but it's up to them to come see us.\"\nThe western Texas town of Seminole - population 7,000 - is bordered by miles of rural farmland and oil fields.\nAmong billboards for restaurants, gun silencers and tractors, a digital sign hints at the crisis gripping the community: a warning about the dangers of measles, which can cause complications including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nIt has spread rapidly among Mennonites, a religious community living near Seminole. Mr Holbrooks estimates the population could be as many as 40,000 across several counties. In those areas, public school vaccination rates are as low as 82%. \nRoughly 95% of a community must be vaccinated against the measles to achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease that its spread is limited and the unvaccinated are protected.\nMr Holbrooks remembers when the Low German Mennonite group began migrating to his hometown and nearby states in the 1970s. The religion has no specific doctrines against vaccinations, but they tend to avoid many modern aspects of life, including the health care system. \nTheir community is not alone. At least 118,000 kindergarteners in Texas are exempt from one or more vaccines, mostly in rural areas, according to Terri Burke, director of Texas vaccine advocacy group the Immunization Partnership. Parents can get a waiver to exempt their child from school vaccine requirements for a variety of reasons, including religion.\nSavannah Knelsen, an 18-year-old server at a Seminole barbecue restaurant, has not been vaccinated against measles - or anything else.\nMany of her family members and friends - also unvaccinated - caught the measles in recent weeks. One relative developed a fever of 104.5F (40.2C), but still chose not to go to the hospital.\nThe recent deaths of two children have not convinced her to get vaccinated, she said, adding that she was healthy and wanted to let her body \"fight off\" infections. Experts agree the vaccine is the best way to prevent infections - including severe ones.\nMs Knelsen's 19-year-old co-worker, Jessica Giesbrecht, along with her family, has been vaccinated against the measles.\n\"I'm worried for my baby niece,\" Ms Giesbrecht said, adding that she was too young to be vaccinated.\nStill, the two said the outbreak doesn't weigh heavily on daily life. Others in Seminole agree.\nA cashier at a local pharmacy said no one has stopped by for measles vaccinations since the outbreak started. \"People are just going about their lives,\" she said. \nOn Sunday, Kennedy made his first trip to the region since the outbreak to attend the eight-year-old girl's funeral.\nThe top US health official is an unlikely figure to spearhead the fight against measles - having in the past endorsed conspiracy theories about immunisation, including debunked claims about links to autism. He downplayed the outbreak in western Texas at first, calling it \"not unusual\".\nTrump echoed these remarks last weekend, saying that only a \"fairly small number of people\" had been impacted, when he was asked about it by the BBC aboard Air Force One. It was \"not something new\", he added.\nOn Wednesday, Kennedy gave his strongest statement yet in support of the measles vaccine, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News: \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine.\" \nThe remarks were met with social media backlash from some anti-vaccine supporters. Kennedy added, however, that the government \"should not be mandating\" vaccines.\nThe influence of some of his earlier remarks lingers.\nIn one of several Mennonite-owned natural-health stores in Seminole, dozens of bottles of cod liver oil - a supplement that contains vitamin A - are on display. Alongside the vaccine, Kennedy has promoted vitamin A as an alternative measles treatment, a remedy doctors say should not be given without guidance from a physician and is no substitute for the vaccine.\nThe treatment has at times proven dangerous. Covenant Children's Hospital in nearby Lubbock told the BBC it has treated several unvaccinated children with measles for vitamin A toxicity - some had attempted to use it as a preventative measure.\nThe community needs federal officials to provide stronger messaging to help convince people to get vaccinated and slow the outbreak, said Gordon Mattimoe, director of the health department in nearby Andrews County.\n\"People look to their leaders to lead,\" he said.\nJeff Hutt, a former spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee and Kennedy's former national field director, argued that the health secretary had to \"cover the middle ground\", providing statements that are \"politically adequate\" while also providing sceptical stances on vaccines.\n\"In covering the middle ground, I'm not necessarily sure he was able to reassure folks that he had a handle on [measles], or that he was able to reassure folks that he was sticking to his guns,\" Mr Hutt said.\nThe Trump administration's health policies could have other consequences in Texas, officials say. Local health departments are at risk of losing critical resources because of attempts to cut $11.4bn (\u00a38.8bn) in public health grants. The move was temporarily blocked by a judge last week.\nMr Mattimoe said that because of the potential cuts - around $250,000 in grant funding for his health department - he is not able to hire a new nurse to give immunisations.\nIn a statement to the BBC, the US Department of Health and Human Services said it had deployed the \"necessary\" resources from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to respond to the outbreak.\n\"The CDC is in close, constant communication with local and state health officials on the ground to ensure they have what they need,\" the official said.\nThe Texas Department of Health Services could lose as much as $550m in grant funding. It has provided staff, vaccines, testing and other support to local health departments, but likely will need extra funding, spokesman Chris Van Deusen told the BBC.\nMr Mattimoe contacted lawmakers and the state for help, but is not hopeful.\n\"I don't think they have the funds,\" he said.\nIn nearby Lubbock, Texas, just two days after the news of Daisy's death, all was quiet at the health department's vaccination clinic.\nOther days had been busier, with as many as 20 people coming in for vaccines, said Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city, where hospitals receive children with severe measles cases from more rural counties.\nSince the outbreak began in January, the city of Seminole has vaccinated 103 adults and 143 children against the measles, Mr Holbrooks said. The neighbouring three rural counties decided to close their underused vaccine clinics and send more staff to hard-hit Seminole.\n\"There's always talk on, what else can we do, and are we doing enough?\" Mr Holbrooks said. \"We want to build trust, not tear it down.\"\nAt times, local health officials have seen progress.\nA Mennonite doctor in Andrews County gained community members' trust and encouraged them to get vaccinated, said Mr Mattimoe.\n\"Those trusted messengers in those communities - I think [they're] very important,\" he said.\nMs Wells hopes vaccinations will start to pick up after the latest measles death and the city's new guidance to vaccinate children as young as six months, instead of one year.\nThe bigger city saw an outbreak at a daycare, among children too young to be fully vaccinated, a situation she believes will be helped by the earlier shots.\nBut \"there's always going to be some people that we don't reach\", Ms Wells said.\nThat means the virus is likely to circulate for a while in western Texas regions where people are unvaccinated, officials said.\n\"We're just at the beginning of it,\" Mr Mattimoe said. \"It's going to have to run through the community. Until they get that natural immunity, it'll just keep running its course.\"",

        "article_text": "The price for a cup of coffee in the US is going up as tariffs put the squeeze on local caf\u00e9 and bakery owners.\nSome US businesses say the queues for a morning latte are already getting shorter as customers tighten their belts and imported beans become more expensive.\nAmericans spend $100bn (\u00a376bn) a year on coffee, though that might be about to change.\nJorge Prudencio, who runs Bread Bite Bakery in Washington DC, says his Colombia-based coffee distributer just increased prices after the sweeping tariffs went into effect last week.\nThe vast majority of coffee in the US is imported.\nIn fact, the US is the world's second-leading importer of coffee, with the majority coming from Brazil and Colombia, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\nSince 5 April, coffee imports have been affected by the 10% US tariffs against most countries.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Prudencio said his coffee suppliers have told him his next order will carry yet another price hike.\nHe added that his bakery will \"definitely\" be increasing prices for customers just to break even.\nAsked if he is worried, Mr Prudencio said: \"Of course.\"\nThe manager of Au Lait caf\u00e9 just down the street, Kamal Mortada, said he's been seeing the effect of steadily increasing prices for a while now. Inflation spiked to a 40-year high under former US President Joe Biden.\nBefore the tariffs kicked in, ground coffee reached the highest ever recorded price in March 2025, and was over a dollar more expensive than the previous year, and $3 above March 2020 prices.\n\"We have less customers for coffee,\" Mr Mortada said.\n\"Most customers just get plain coffee,\" instead of adding syrups and milks, he said.\nThe prices on the menu have gone up by 25% and people are now buying smaller coffees.\nMr Mortada has also changed his own habits as a consumer. Instead of his regular trip to Starbucks, he brews coffee at home.\nHe said he has seen the price of a cup of coffee go up by at least half a dollar, and is worried prices will rise again. \nOn the opposite coast in San Francisco, another local coffee shop owner is grappling with what the tariffs will mean for her business. \nJenny Ngo, who runs Telescope Coffee, said she was waiting to hear how much her roaster will hike prices.\nThe coffee she sells is sourced from Ethiopia and Guatemala, both facing the standard 10% tariff.

It was an X-rated horror show.\nIt is a flaw the Australian has simply been unable to cure, undermining all his fine attacking principles that prompted such optimism and hope in the early months of his reign.\nSince Postecoglou took over before the 2023-24 campaign, only West Ham and Sheffield United (seven each) have scored more Premier League own goals than the six by Spurs.\nAnd only the current bottom three clubs \u2013 Southampton (26), Leicester (22) and Ipswich (19) \u2013 have lost more league games than their 17 this season.\nIt is the most defeats Spurs have suffered in a league campaign since 2003-04 (19) when they finished 14th.\nThere does have to be some context applied to this defeat, though.\nPostecoglou's priorities, perfectly understandably, lie with the Europa League quarter-final second leg away to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday after a 1-1 draw in the first meeting at home.\nIt explained the six changes that saw Son Heung-min, Micky van de Ven, Pedro Porro and Destiny Udogie kept back, while Rodrigo Bentancur came on as substitute. The big bonus was the return of Dejan Kulusevski after injury for a 15-minute run-out.\nThere is also a worrying downside to that context too.\nIf there is any repeat of the carelessness and general incompetence that scarred this display, then Spurs' trophy hopes will be over for another season and so, in all probability, will be Postecoglou's spell in charge.\nWhat cannot be explained away is the slapdash manner and lack of basic organisation that allowed rejuvenated Wolves to record a fourth straight top-flight success for the first time since January 1972.\nIt started inside two minutes, when keeper Vicario's tame punch from a corner found Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri unmarked from the set-piece on the edge of the area. He accepted the invitation to score.\nThe second was another calamity, Vicario again culpable when he turned home striker Marshall Munetsi's tame header on to Spence when he could have held on, the ball rebounded back into his own goal.\nAnd even when Mathys Tel offered hope just before the hour with his second league goal in successive games, Cristian Romero flouted his status as a World Cup winner with a shocking piece of defending. The Argentina centre-back was robbed and beaten by Ait-Nouri, who crossed for Jorgen Strand Larsen to score with ease, and for a fourth successive game.\nIt went on.\nSpurs inflicted more of their own wounds after Richarlison thought he had set up a tense finale with five minutes left.\nLucas Bergvall, instrumental in Spurs' first goal, then coughed up possession too easily in an instant, leaving Matheus Cunha to race clear and score just a minute later.\nWolves edge closer to safety as Spurs suffer again\n'We've got a leak' - Spurs to 'deal with' problem in camp\nTottenham fans expressed their discontent - especially towards chairman Daniel Levy - during the defeat at Wolverhampton Wanderers\nThere has to be a measure of sympathy for Postecoglou, who looked a disconsolate figure as he made his way across towards those Spurs supporters who were left after the final whistle, because some of these errors were the sort for which no manager can legislate.\nPostecoglou defended his players saying: \"The goals weren't lapses or anything, they were individual errors, which is unusual for us to give goals away like that. But that's what happens and we got punished and makes it difficult for us to get an outcome.\"\nIt was a very generous interpretation from a manager who has taken so much heat himself \u2013 but the volume of these mistakes, and the regularity with which they have happened in this dismal season, point to a deeper problem.\nOn the individual errors by Romero and Bergvall, he added: \"It's not like they're doing it on purpose. Those two are pretty reliable in those situations. Today was a collection of events that were unusual and that makes it difficult to get anything out of the game.\"\nThose who sit in judgement on Postecoglou's future, and in the stands at Molineux, may beg to differ given the number of times Spurs have been similarly exposed this season.\nAnd, with his usual honesty, Postecoglou added: \"Mistakes are part of football, I'm not going to be holding anyone to account, the only person who gets held to account is me.\n\"I thought we played pretty well but conceded some pretty poor goals. Individual errors cost us. It's disappointing to lose.\"\nThe backdrop to it all was the sight of thousands of discontented Spurs fans stretched along one side of Molineux.\nThey did not aim their ire in the direction of Postecoglou, but chairman Daniel Levy, with loud chants of \"We Want Levy Out\" after only eight minutes, while holding up banners emblazoned with the message \"Time For Change\".\nThe status quo remains for now but it all comes down, as it has for some time, to the Europa League as Postecoglou's final chance to fulfil his promise of winning a trophy in his second season.\nIt may be his final chance. Full stop.\nThere is much to admire about Postecoglou and his purist footballing principles, but in reality it has all come down to events in Frankfurt this Thursday night.\nIt is now or never for Postecoglou and Spurs.\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\nGet Tottenham news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution?\n\"A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please.\" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.\nThe upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.\nHe was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.\nKnown as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth \u00a36bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.\nOur meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.\nHis profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.\nBut six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed \"legally binding\" undertakings. \nThe government was awarded a so-called \"golden share\", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.\nEarlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.\nBut step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?\nRoyal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.\nBut in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.\nRoyal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year. \nIn December 2024, it was fined \u00a310.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.\nWhile the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.\nRoyal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of \u00a33.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.\nAt its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than \u00a36bn but had slumped to just over \u00a32bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April. \nHe sealed the deal at \u00a33.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.\n\"Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,\" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. \"It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.\n\"This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.\"\nPart of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.\nUnder what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.\n\"Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,\" says Ms King.\nMr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company \u2013 EP Group \u2013 intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.\nHe sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.\nThe USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail \u00a3300m a year \u2013 putting it back on a break-even footing.\nMr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO \"as long as I am alive\", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that \"rational minds prevail\" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.\nSo far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".\nGiven letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".\nWhile Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.\nRoyal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".\nIt also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".\nBut there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.\nAlong with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised. \nLast year GLS made a profit of \u00a3320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost \u00a3348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.\n\"GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,\" says Mr Paterson.\nMr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".\nIn fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.\nWhat the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.\nGiven all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?\nWell, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.\nAdd to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.\nMr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.\nEarlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.\nRoyal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.\nEmma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an \"historic change\" to give postboxes \"a new lease of life\".\nAll of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.\n\"If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,\" says Mr Paterson.\n\"There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.\"\nBut Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.\nThat Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws.\nThen there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe \u2013 paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.\nSpeaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.\nGetting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. \"The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,\" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. \"We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.\"\nBut during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.\nMr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.\nUnion bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky \"couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years\".\nSo, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice?\nThe frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not.\nThe monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.\n\nTop image credit: Getty\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "summary": "Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be \"nonsensical\".In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.Catching up with competitorsGiven all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.ReutersThe Czech entrepreneur has been described as a \"quiet sphinx\" for his inscrutable styleMr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. \"Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\".Given letter numbers are falling, \"we have to think about what is economical\", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail \"to make sure it is sustainable\".While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets \u2013 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five \u2013 is \"over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service\".It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies \"goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation\".European parcel know-howBut there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 \u2013 long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky \"couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years\".So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice?The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review.",

        "article_text": "The World Health Organization has said conditions at hospitals in Gaza are \"beyond description\", after a major facility was put out of service by an Israeli air strike.\nSpokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told the BBC it was seeing \"attack after attack\" on hospitals and healthcare workers, and medical supplies were critically low due to Israel's blockade of the territory.\nOn Sunday, staff at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City said an Israeli strike had destroyed its laboratory and damaged its emergency room. They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care.\nThe Israeli military said it hit a \"command-and-control centre\" used by Hamas to plan attacks.\nThe hospital is run by the Church of England, whose bishops said they shared \"grief, sorrow and outrage\" with Palestinians over the attack and called on Israel to provide evidence to support its claim.\nA ceasefire in Gaza ended when Israel resumed its air and ground campaign four weeks ago, saying that military pressure would force Hamas to release the hostages it is still holding.\nAl-Ahli hospital was struck by two missiles around midnight on Sunday - the fifth time it has been hit since the beginning of the war.\nAccording to the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, the two-storey genetic laboratory was demolished and the pharmacy and emergency department buildings were damaged. Surrounding buildings were also damaged, including St Philip's Church.\nThe diocese said the Israel military gave a 20-minute warning to hospital staff and patients to evacuate before the attack.\nThere were no casualties as a result of the strike, but one child who had previously suffered a head injury died as a result of the rushed evacuation process, it added.\nLater, WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN agency had been told by al-Ahli's director that the emergency room, laboratory, emergency room X-ray machines, and the pharmacy were \"destroyed\".\nThe hospital was forced to move 50 patients to other hospitals, but 40 patients in a critical condition could not be moved, he added.\n\"Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law. Attacks on health care must stop. Once again we repeat: patients, health workers and hospitals must be protected.\"\nThe Israeli foreign ministry said it was a \"precise strike on a single building that was used by Hamas as a terror command and control centre\" and where there was \"no medical activity take place\".\nIt also stressed that an \"early warning\" was issued, and that the strike was \"carried out while avoiding further damage to the hospital compound, which remained operational for continued medical treatment\".\nHamas condemned the attack as a \"savage crime\" and rejected the claim that it was using the facility for military purposes.\nOn Monday, the Church of England's House of Bishops said in a statement they were \"dismayed that hospitals have become battlegrounds in Gaza\" and that Israel had \"yet to provide clear and compelling evidence to substantiate its claim\" that the hospital was being used by Hamas.\n\"Against that backdrop, we call for an independent, thorough and transparent investigation into this attack as well as the alleged misuse of the hospital.\"\nThe bishops also said that \"the extremely limited time given to staff and patients to evacuate the hospital was a further assault on fundamental human rights and basic human dignity\".\nWHO representative Dr Rik Peeperkorn meanwhile told the BBC that al-Ahli was now unable to receive new patients pending repairs, and that this would \"heavily impact trauma patients\".\n\"Al-Ahli was a key trauma hospital north of Wadi Gaza. It is the hospital with the only functional CT scanner north of Wadi Gaza,\" he said, referring to the valley that effectively divides the territory in two because it is an Israeli-designated \"no-go\" area.\nThe charity Medical Aid for Palestinians also quoted an orthopaedic surgeon at al-Ahli as saying that the level of care the hospital could provide to the 40 remaining patients was \"quite similar to that of a hostel\".\n\"We are unable to perform any surgical procedures, as these patients require laboratory diagnostics, pharmacy support, and emergency referrals in case of complications - all of which have ceased entirely due to the recent attack,\" Dr Ahmed al-Shurafa said.\nDr Harris warned: \"We're seeing attack after attack on hospitals, healthcare workers, ambulance workers... the very people that are relied on, who give their all to save lives. But they don't give their all to lose their lives.\"\nOn 23 March, the Israeli military struck the surgical department of Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, killing Hamas finance chief Ismail Barhoum and one other person.\nHamas said Barhoum was being treated for injuries that he suffered in an earlier Israeli attack. The military denied this, saying he was in the hospital \"in order to commit acts of terrorism\".\nThat same day, 15 emergency workers, including eight Palestinian Red Crescent paramedics, were shot and killed by Israeli troops in nearby Rafah as they responded to a report of wounded people.\nThe Israeli military said the troops \"opened fire due to a perceived threat\" and that six of those killed were \"Hamas terrorists\", without giving evidence. The Red Crescent denied the allegation and accused Israel of a \"full-fledged war crime\".\nOn Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had received information that a ninth paramedic who had been missing since the attack was being held \"in an Israeli place of detention\".\nThe ICRC's head of sub-delegation in Gaza, Adrian Zimmermann, also warned that the wider shortage of medical supplies \"puts the life and the wellbeing of Gazans who require healthcare services at risk\".\nDr Peeperkorn said they were running critically low because Israel had not allowed in any deliveries of humanitarian aid for more than six weeks.\nHe added that the WHO had stockpiled some supplies in its warehouses during the recent ceasefire, but that the Israeli military was not facilitating transfers between northern and southern Gaza.\n\"Last week, we had a discussion with one of the medical specialists at al-Ahli. He was telling us that they had to use the same surgical gowns and the same surgical gloves for various operations, while we have surgical gloves and gowns in our warehouse in Deir al-Balah [south of Wadi Gaza],\" he recalled. \"We want to bring them, but we are not facilitated.\"\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 50,980 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nA ceasefire deal that began in January and lasted two months saw Hamas release 33 Israeli hostages \u2013 eight of them dead \u2013 and five Thai hostages in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and a surge in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.\nIsrael resumed its offensive on 18 March, blaming Hamas's refusal to accept a proposal for an extension of the agreement's first phase and the release of more of the 59 hostages it is still holding, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.\nHamas accused Israel of violating the original deal, according to which there would be a second phase where all the remaining living hostages would be handed over and the war brought to a permanent end.\nOn Monday, a Hamas delegation led by the group's chief negotiator left Cairo without making any progress in talks with Egyptian mediators aimed at reaching a new ceasefire agreement, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC.\n\"No breakthrough was achieved due to Israel's refusal to commit to ending the war and withdrawing from the Gaza Strip,\" the official said.\n\"Hamas showed flexibility, regarding the number of hostages to be released in order to make progress. But Israel wants the hostages back without ending the war,\" he claimed.\nIsrael has said it is waiting for a response to its latest proposal, sent at the end of last week.\nIt is understood to have reduced slightly the number of hostages it is demanding should be released in exchange for an extension of the truce and the entry of humanitarian aid.\nA group of hostages' families, known as the Tikvah Forum, said on Monday that the parents of Eitan Mor had been told by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the government was working on a deal that would see 10 hostages freed - down from 11 or 12.

They did not report any direct casualties, but said a child died due to disruption of care.The Israeli military said it hit a \"command-and-control centre\" used by Hamas to plan attacks.The hospital is run by the Church of England, whose bishops said they shared \"grief, sorrow and outrage\" with Palestinians over the attack and called on Israel to provide evidence to support its claim.A ceasefire in Gaza ended when Israel resumed its air and ground campaign four weeks ago, saying that military pressure would force Hamas to release the hostages it is still holding.Gaza medic missing since deadly attack being detained by Israel, Red Cross saysIsraeli air strike destroys part of last fully functional hospital in Gaza CityAl-Ahli hospital was struck by two missiles around midnight on Sunday - the fifth time it has been hit since the beginning of the war.According to the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem, the two-storey genetic laboratory was demolished and the pharmacy and emergency department buildings were damaged. \"The Israeli foreign ministry said it was a \"precise strike on a single building that was used by Hamas as a terror command and control centre\" and where there was \"no medical activity take place\".It also stressed that an \"early warning\" was issued, and that the strike was \"carried out while avoiding further damage to the hospital compound, which remained operational for continued medical treatment\".Hamas condemned the attack as a \"savage crime\" and rejected the claim that it was using the facility for military purposes.Footage shows damage at Gaza City hospital siteOn Monday, the Church of England's House of Bishops said in a statement they were \"dismayed that hospitals have become battlegrounds in Gaza\" and that Israel had \"yet to provide clear and compelling evidence to substantiate its claim\" that the hospital was being used by Hamas. The Red Crescent denied the allegation and accused Israel of a \"full-fledged war crime\".On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had received information that a ninth paramedic who had been missing since the attack was being held \"in an Israeli place of detention\".EPASt Philip's Church, which is on the hospital site, was also damagedThe ICRC's head of sub-delegation in Gaza, Adrian Zimmermann, also warned that the wider shortage of medical supplies \"puts the life and the wellbeing of Gazans who require healthcare services at risk\".Dr Peeperkorn said they were running critically low because Israel had not allowed in any deliveries of humanitarian aid for more than six weeks.He added that the WHO had stockpiled some supplies in its warehouses during the recent ceasefire, but that the Israeli military was not facilitating transfers between northern and southern Gaza. \"We are unable to perform any surgical procedures, as these patients require laboratory diagnostics, pharmacy support, and emergency referrals in case of complications - all of which have ceased entirely due to the recent attack,\" Dr Ahmed al-Shurafa said.Dr Harris warned: \"We're seeing attack after attack on hospitals, healthcare workers, ambulance workers... the very people that are relied on, who give their all to save lives.",

        "article_text": "More than three million children around the world are thought to have died in 2022 as a result of infections that are resistant to antibiotics, according to a study by two leading experts in child health. \nChildren in Africa and South East Asia were found to be most at risk. \nAntimicrobial resistance - known as AMR - develops when the microbes that cause infections evolve in such a way that antibiotic drugs no longer work.\nIt has been identified as one of the biggest public health threats facing the world's population.\nA new study now reveals the toll that AMR is taking on children.\nUsing data from multiple sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, the report's authors have calculated there were more than three million child deaths in 2022 linked to drug-resistant infections.\nExperts say this new study highlights a more than tenfold increase in AMR-related infections in children in just three years.\nThe number could have been made worse by the impact of the Covid pandemic.\nAntibiotics are used to treat or prevent a huge range of bacterial infections - everything from skin infections to pneumonia. \nThey are also sometimes given as a precaution to prevent, rather than treat, an infection - for example if someone is having an operation or receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer.\nAntibiotics have no impact on viral infections, though - illnesses such as the common cold, flu or Covid.\nBut some bacteria have now evolved resistance to some drugs, due to their overuse and inappropriate use, while the production of new antibiotics  - a lengthy and costly process - has slowed right down.\nThe report's lead authors, Doctor Yanhong Jessika Hu of Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia and Professor Herb Harwell of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, point to a significant growth in the use of antibiotics that are meant to only be held back for the most serious infections. \nBetween 2019 and 2021 the use of \"watch antibiotics\", drugs with a high risk of resistance, increased by 160% in South East Asia and 126% in Africa.\nOver the same period, \"reserve antibiotics\" -  last-resort treatments for severe, multidrug-resistant infections - rose by 45% in South East Asia and 125% in Africa.\nThe authors warn that if bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternatives for treating multidrug-resistant infections.\nProf Harwell is presenting the findings at the Congress of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Vienna later this month.\n\"AMR is a global problem. It affects everyone. We did this work really to focus on the disproportionate way in which AMR affects children,\" he said ahead of the event.\n\"We estimate three million deaths of children worldwide associated with antimicrobial resistance.\"\nThe WHO describes AMR as one of the most serious global health threats we face, but speaking from Vienna, Prof Harwell warns that there are no easy answers.\n\"It's a multi-faceted problem that extends into all aspects of medicine and really, human life,\" he said. \n\"Antibiotics are ubiquitous around us, they end up in our food and the environment and so coming up with a single solution is not easy.\"\nThe best way to avoid a resistant infection is to avoid infection altogether, which means higher levels of immunisation, water sanitation and hygiene are needed, he adds.\n\"There's going to be more antibiotics use because there's more people who need them, but we need to make sure that they are used appropriately and the correct medicines are used.\"\nDr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, said the new study \"marks a significant and alarming increase compared to previous data\".\n\"These findings should serve as a wake-up call for global health leaders. Without decisive action, AMR could undermine decades of progress in child health, particularly in the world's most vulnerable regions.\"",

The Stone Roses' almost legendary show at Spike Island.\nHeld on the banks of the Mersey in Widnes, Cheshire, at the height of the Madchester pioneers' fame in 1990, it has become one of rock music's most mythologised gigs.\nFormed in Manchester in 1985, The Stone Roses originally featured singer Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bass player Gary 'Mani' Mounfield and drummer Alan 'Reni' Wren.\nWith singles such as This Is the One, I Am the Resurrection and Fools Gold, they provided some of the biggest soundtracks of the Madchester music scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nThe movement saw an explosion of a musical and cultural scene in their home city, where a blend of indie rock, acid house, psychedelia and 1960s pop rose in popularity.\nMatt Mead, who has published a book about the band, said they were \"the biggest band at that time\". \n\"They were as big, if not bigger, than U2, who were massive,\" he said.\n\"Their musicianship was second to none. \n\"You just had four members, but there was some sort of magic that happened when they were on stage.\"\nAlong with the music, the band also had a distinctive style, leading fans to adopt baggy clothing, mop haircuts and bucket hats. \nTheir beloved Manchester United even launched a kit collection in 2024 inspired by the band.\nAs part of their series of gigs, The Stone Roses held a concert at Spike Island on a sunny day on 27 May 1990.\nIt seemed like the ideal spot, almost equidistant from the huge musical hubs of Manchester and Liverpool and the band's legions of North-West fans.\nCreated after the 1833 extension of the Sankey Canal in Widnes, Cheshire, the island was the centre of Britain's chemical industry during the Industrial Revolution.\nFactories and railways dominated the area until the industry went into decline in the 20th Century.\nThe area has now become a haven for wildlife with paths for walkers and cyclists.\nOfficial figures suggest about 28,000 people attended the concert on 27 May 1990 but Mead reckons that goes up to about 30,000 if gatecrashers were included.\nDave Haslam performed a DJ set before The Stone Roses' performance.\nHe said there was an element of chaos from the start as the band's management booked the wrong DJ acts, getting rave favourite Frankie Bones instead of house legend Frankie Knuckles.\nHe said that sort of misstep was \"evidence of the endearing amateurism around the gig\".\n\"My generation were not really into open air festivals,\" he said. \n\"Glastonbury wasn't anywhere like it is as big now.\n\"We liked rave venues or basement live music.\n\"We liked sweaty little venues clubs in the middle of town.\"\nThere have been mixed reviews of the concert with Pulp guitarist Mark Webber telling BBC 6 Music describing the show as \"a slight anticlimax\". \n\"There was a lot of anticipation but it didn't sound very good,\" he said.\n\"It was very windy and the vibe wasn't there.\"\nHaslam said that was another example of the lack of experience of putting on such big shows.\n\"I don't think anyone appreciated that you need to a lot of amplification to reach the back of the crowd, because all the sound just gets lost in the atmosphere,\" he said.\nMead, who is helping on a documentary project about the concert, said recently-found footage revealed \"key moments\".\n\"When the band play I Wanna Be Adored and you see the crowd, it's electric,\" he said.\n\"It's like nothing else \u2013 wall-to-wall bouncing from the front to the back.\"\nHe said there was also \"blissed-out dancing\" during Fools Gold and \"everyone's arms in the air\" for I Am the Resurrection.\nHaslam also remembers fans filing out of the gig in \"very, very high spirits\".\n\"Whatever the problems with the sound and waiting around and all of that, I think for those young people, they knew they'd had a day out to remember,\" he added.\nUntil a full recording came to light in 2024, it was thought the concert had not been captured on film, making it the subject of much mystique for those who weren't there. \nBut even with the new find, Haslam believes the gig was significant because The Stone Roses \"didn't play that often\" and it felt like \"a life-changing moment\".\n\"It was an opportunity to see this band that had somehow seemed to be the most significant band of the era.\n\"It was the culmination of two or three years when a certain look and a sound that was a kind of cross between funky indie and rave really animated a new generation.\"\nHe said the Spike Island show was part of a series of gigs that \"took The Stone Roses from being a big local band and a kind of Manchester secret to being internationally renowned\".\nCrews travelled from France and Germany for the event while fans came from across the country.\nHaslam said there \"wasn't really anything similar afterwards\" for the band due to the time it took the band to release a second album.\n\"That took far too long - four or five years - so a lot of the momentum went out of the Roses at that point and by the time they came back, that part of the world had all moved on to Oasis\".\nHe said Spike Island \"was the only moment where you had The Stone Roses absolutely at their peak, playing music that had been quite underground but had been becoming accepted by the mainstream - that mix of euphoric rave vibe with rock music\".\nAfter the Spike Island show, The Stone Roses became embroiled in a long legal battle with their record label and did not release a follow-up album, The Second Coming, until 1994.\nThree months after its release, Reni left the band and was followed a year later by Squire.\nBrown and Mani tried to carry on with guitarist Aziz Ibrahim and drummer Robbie Maddix joining the band, but within a few months, they dissolved the band.\nSquire, Brown and Mani went on to have post-Roses success, while Reni left music altogether.\nAfter years of rumours, the original line-up finally reformed in 2011, going on to play huge gigs across the globe before Squire confirmed in 2019 that they had split once more.\nThough Pulp had been a working band for over a decade when Spike Island happened, they did not break into the mainstream until the release of their His 'n' Hers album in 1994, before becoming huge stars with the release of their landmark single Common People a year later.\nThat song was taken from their most successful album, Different Class, which also spawned the hit, Sorted for E's and Wizz, which Cocker has now revealed was a sister song to the new single and was also based on a fan's experience of the Stone Roses' gig.\nThe inspiration for that track was \"a girl that I was speaking to at The Leadmill (nightclub) in Sheffield one night,\" he said.\n\"She said all that she could remember were people going round saying, 'Is everyone sorted for E's and wizz?'. \n\"So that phrase stuck in my mind.\"\nHe said he did not go to Spike Island, but had written the new song's lyrics after speaking to various attendees, including musician Jason Buckle, from the band All Seeing I, who co-wrote the single.\n\"All he could remember was a DJ who between every song said, 'Spike Island come alive, Spike Island come alive',\" he said.\n\"That phrase stuck with me. \n\"I've got a very short attention span I think.\"\nRead more stories from Cheshire on the BBC, watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer and follow BBC North West on X.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'Oh my goodness!' - Salah's best Premier League Liverpool goals\nMohamed Salah's new contract is the perfect outcome for all involved with Liverpool and delivers confirmation that both parties in this sporting marriage simply cannot live without each other.\nSalah, even though he is 33 in June, would have received lucrative offers from elsewhere had he decided to leave Anfield on a free transfer when his current \u00a3350,000-a-week agreement ends at the conclusion of this season.\nThe availability of this world-class talent, as driven as ever and seemingly still at the peak of physical powers, would have attracted the attention of the biggest European names as well as sparking renewed interest from the Saudi Pro League, that arguably prizes the signing of Salah above all others when measured by current global profile.\nIt was on 24 November, after scoring twice in a 3-2 win at Southampton, that Salah claimed he was \"more out than in\" at Liverpool and had yet to receive a formal contract off.\nHe had already sounded the alarm bells among supporters in September by suggesting after the 3-0 victory at Manchester United that this might be his final season at Anfield.\nSalah has, instead, extended his time at Liverpool and a love affair that began almost from the moment he scored his first goal for the club following a \u00a334m move from AS Roma, a bundled effort in a 3-3 draw at Watford on the opening day of the 2017-18 season.\nSalah signs new Liverpool deal\nFirst Salah, now 'growing expectation' Van Dijk will stay\nFor Liverpool owner's Fenway Sports Group (FSG), it keeps hold of a player the fans instantly crowned \"the Egyptian King\", while demonstrating it is willing to bend from a \"Moneyball\" philosophy that has previously made it reluctant to award lucrative deals to over-30s.\nSalah's form and fitness makes him a special case, something FSG has readily acknowledged.\nAnd for head coach Arne Slot, who has made a seamless transition from the Jurgen Klopp era with Liverpool on course for a 20th title, he can plan for the future with an Anfield icon and one of the great stars of the modern era.\nIt is all a far cry from Salah's first appearance in front of Liverpool's fans, as a shadow Chelsea player drafted into a weakened team fielded by Jose Mourinho on 27 April 2014, a game remembered for Steven Gerrard's slip and a 2-0 loss that cost the Reds great the chance of an elusive Premier League winners' medal.\nSalah had rejected Liverpool to move to Chelsea from Basel four months earlier but made little impact, scoring only two goals in 19 appearances with 10 starts at Stamford Bridge.\nHe even heard ironic cheers from the Kop that day when he was booked for fouling Raheem Sterling.\nSince then, it has only been adulation for Salah, who now gets the chance to write new chapters in his legendary Liverpool story.\nSalah arrived at Liverpool with a reputation as a gifted player, although an occasionally wayward finisher.\nThe dedication and desire was always there as he proved when he was 14, travelling more than four hours by bus, sometimes changing five times, from his home to train with Arab Contractors, then taking the same return journey.\nIt soon became clear Liverpool had acquired a player with pace, skill and a priceless ability to score and create goals from a starting position wide on the right.\nAs an individual, Salah has always kept a low profile, as Murat Yakin \u2013 the Switzerland coach who worked with the Egyptian at Basel - told BBC Sport after his astonishing early impact at Anfield:  \"Mo is very humble and modest.

        "summary": "- Salah's best Premier League Liverpool goalsPhil McNultyChief football writerPublished11 April 2025, 08:31 BST493 CommentsUpdated 8 hours agoMohamed Salah's new contract is the perfect outcome for all involved with Liverpool and delivers confirmation that both parties in this sporting marriage simply cannot live without each other.Salah, even though he is 33 in June, would have received lucrative offers from elsewhere had he decided to leave Anfield on a free transfer when his current \u00a3350,000-a-week agreement ends at the conclusion of this season.The availability of this world-class talent, as driven as ever and seemingly still at the peak of physical powers, would have attracted the attention of the biggest European names as well as sparking renewed interest from the Saudi Pro League, that arguably prizes the signing of Salah above all others when measured by current global profile.It was on 24 November, after scoring twice in a 3-2 win at Southampton, that Salah claimed he was \"more out than in\" at Liverpool and had yet to receive a formal contract off.He had already sounded the alarm bells among supporters in September by suggesting after the 3-0 victory at Manchester United that this might be his final season at Anfield.Salah has, instead, extended his time at Liverpool and a love affair that began almost from the moment he scored his first goal for the club following a \u00a334m move from AS Roma, a bundled effort in a 3-3 draw at Watford on the opening day of the 2017-18 season.Salah signs new Liverpool dealPublished9 hours agoFirst Salah, now 'growing expectation' Van Dijk will stayPublished1 day agoFor Liverpool owner's Fenway Sports Group (FSG), it keeps hold of a player the fans instantly crowned \"the Egyptian King\", while demonstrating it is willing to bend from a \"Moneyball\" philosophy that has previously made it reluctant to award lucrative deals to over-30s.Salah's form and fitness makes him a special case, something FSG has readily acknowledged.And for head coach Arne Slot, who has made a seamless transition from the Jurgen Klopp era with Liverpool on course for a 20th title, he can plan for the future with an Anfield icon and one of the great stars of the modern era.It is all a far cry from Salah's first appearance in front of Liverpool's fans, as a shadow Chelsea player drafted into a weakened team fielded by Jose Mourinho on 27 April 2014, a game remembered for Steven Gerrard's slip and a 2-0 loss that cost the Reds great the chance of an elusive Premier League winners' medal.Salah had rejected Liverpool to move to Chelsea from Basel four months earlier but made little impact, scoring only two goals in 19 appearances with 10 starts at Stamford Bridge.He even heard ironic cheers from the Kop that day when he was booked for fouling Raheem Sterling.Since then, it has only been adulation for Salah, who now gets the chance to write new chapters in his legendary Liverpool story.Salah arrived at Liverpool with a reputation as a gifted player, although an occasionally wayward finisher.The dedication and desire was always there as he proved when he was 14, travelling more than four hours by bus, sometimes changing five times, from his home to train with Arab Contractors, then taking the same return journey.It soon became clear Liverpool had acquired a player with pace, skill and a priceless ability to score and create goals from a starting position wide on the right.As an individual, Salah has always kept a low profile, as Murat Yakin \u2013 the Switzerland coach who worked with the Egyptian at Basel - told BBC Sport after his astonishing early impact at Anfield:  \"Mo is very humble and modest.

        "article_text": "Viewers have been \"shattered\" by Eulogy, an emotional new episode in the seventh season of Charlie Brooker's series, starring Paul Giamatti.\nSince 2011, Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones' dystopian anthology series, Black Mirror, has presented 34 stories about the dark side of technology: how computer systems and digital gadgets might distort, warp and even end life for humans.\nThere have been the shocking, twist-filled episodes \u2013 a prime minister is forced to have intercourse with a pig on live TV to release a kidnapped princess (National Anthem); a woman chased by bounty hunters on a sadistic reality TV show is revealed to be a child-killer (White Bear) \u2013 but every so often, there's a tale that transcends the \"what if technology went bad?\" theme and instead manages to capture the multi-layered nuances of human existence.\nThis gentle, more emotional side to Black Mirror has previously emerged in several fan-favourite episodes, such as San Junipero, released in 2016: a love story between two young women set in the 80s, that is later revealed to be a simulated reality where the dead and the still living can co-exist together online. Be Right Back (2013) was prescient in its explorations of AI, and how the experience of grief might lead someone to create a computer-generated version of their loved one. And themes of infidelity and sexual obsession viewed through an embedded memory \"grain\" were explored with devastating results in 2011's The Entire History of You, written by Succession's Jesse Armstrong.\nAnd while there's always a place for slightly silly, catastrophising predictions of the endgame of computers and the internet (Plaything and Common People in season seven are decent new examples of this), Black Mirror excels when the technology is just one part of the story, not the point of the story. The newest series appears to recognise this, and is perhaps the most heartfelt and emotional of the entire catalogue. With three of the seven episodes centred around a love story, however, it's episode five, Eulogy, which has been the standout, quietly devastating viewers on the day of its release.\u00a0\n\"Eulogy broke me in a very particular way I wasn't expecting,\" one viewer wrote on\u00a0X, while another said\u00a0it was \"an utterly heartbreaking yet fantastic piece of television\u2026 just beautifully painful\". Another user\u00a0added: \"Truly incredible from every standard possible. I've been crying for the last 5 minutes\u2026 Heartbreak can't even scrape the surface of what this has made me feel.\" Another was still in recovery from the viewing: \"It ha[d] me sobbing. And I mean heavy, fat tears.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe critics agree. Stylist's Kayleigh Dray\u00a0said, \"Eulogy shattered me, and I can't stop thinking about it,\" while Ben Rosenstock\u00a0from Vulture\u00a0added that it was the \"most heartbreaking episode of the season\".\u00a0GameRant's Aayush Sharma called it \"the best episode of Black Mirror Season 7... Paul Giamatti is EXCEPTIONAL\", and Jake Kleinman from\u00a0Huffington Post said: \"It might even be the best Black Mirror episode in years.\"\nEulogy \u2013 co-written by Brooker and Ella Road \u2013 indeed features a captivating performance from Giamatti as Phillip, an older man who is asked if he'll use a digital chip to access his memories to create a eulogy for the funeral of Carol Royce, a girlfriend who broke his heart in his 20s.\nThe technology set-up is just one impressive strand of this episode as the special effects featured allow Phillip to \"jump\" into old photos, exploring the recreated scene around him. But it's the world-building outside of these merged live-action and CGI scenes that is truly affecting. Piece by piece, the story of Phillip and Carol's relationship and break-up is revealed through his old images and mementos \u2013 how it was fractured by him having an affair; the subsequent dramatic proposal he orchestrates in London; and his humiliation when she walks out on him, never to be heard from again.\u00a0\nHis resulting emotional turmoil is palpable, especially in Giamatti's powerful monologues. But with the help of an avatar \"guide\" (played by Patsy Ferran) in the Eulogy digital chip, Phillip discovers information that gives him a brand new perspective that could have changed the course of his and Carol's lives \u2013 but which, tragically, has come too late.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why The White Lotus season three divided fans and critics\n\u2022 The must-see star-studded takedown of modern Hollywood\n\u2022 The Instagram wellness guru who faked cancer \nBrooker told Vulture that Eulogy is meant to be a companion piece to Be Right Back and The Entire History of You, and examines the blinding, subjective nature of hindsight: \"We were talking about memory and photography, and how an individual's take on memory might deceive them in terms of who they feel is the villain in their life.\" He added to Rolling Stone: \"It's somebody using technology to revisit the past and come out with a slightly different perspective and put some ghosts to rest.\"\u00a0\nBrooker also revealed that the loss of his own father \u2013 and having to read the eulogy at his funeral \u2013 had made the subject even more poignant for him. Eulogy, like much of the anthology, plays with the idea of nostalgia. For Phillip, however, this nostalgia has curdled; any good memories he might have had of Carol have been mentally and physically destroyed by him,\u00a0leaving him quietly seething with regret and bitterness for almost 30 years.\nAs is almost customary for Black Mirror characters \u2013 and in life itself, perhaps \u2013 there is no neat, happy ending in Eulogy, but Phillip is given a bittersweet moment of cathartic acceptance, which is what is really resonating with viewers. As Giamatti told Rolling Stone on reading the script for Eulogy: \"I was really moved by it at the end, which doesn't always happen to me.\" Even the most cynical of Black Mirror fans would have to agree that this might be the most heartfelt episode yet.\u00a0\u00a0\nBlack Mirror season seven is available on Netflix.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

They were accused of trying to stir up a rebellion.\n\"The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,\" Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, deputy leader of SPLM-IO, said at the time.\nWhile Machar's inclusion in the unity government was a key part of the agreement, other parts of it have not been implemented.\nThe key issue for many South Sudanese is the security arrangement.\nThe deal outlined how former rebel forces and government soldiers would be brought together into a unified national army made up of 83,000 troops. The remainder were supposed to be disarmed and demobilised.\nBut this has not happened and there are still lots of militias aligned to different political groups.\nThe deal also outlined the establishment, with the help of the African Union, of a court meant to try the perpetrators of the violence. But this has not been created, in part because those holding some of the top positions in government are reluctant to set up something that could see them put on trial.\nElections that were supposed to happen in 2022 have still not taken place and neither has a new constitution been drawn up.\nWhile Kiir and Machar, both in their 70s, were part of the SPLM that fought for independence, long-standing tensions exist.\nThese have been fuelled by ethnic divisions \u2013 Kiir is Dinka, while Machar is Nuer \u2013 and competing political ambitions.\nWhen Kiir sacked Machar in 2013, triggering the civil war, Machar denounced him as a \"dictator\".\nCreating further problems between the two are the repeated postponements of elections. Polls have been delayed four times, leaving Machar unable to fulfil his presidential ambitions.\nBorn in 1952, the 72-year-old was the 27th son of the chief of Ayod and Leer and was brought up in the Presbyterian Church.\nAs an undergraduate, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Khartoum and in 1984 earned a PhD in philosophy and strategic planning at the UK's Bradford University.\nHe switched sides on several occasions during the battle to secede from Sudan, as he sought to strengthen his position and that of his Nuer ethnic group. \nHe became vice-president of South Sudan at independence in 2011. Machar was sacked in 2013 and then reinstated as part of a deal in 2016, but then fled as fighting resumed.\nBorn in 1951, the 73-year-old devout Roman Catholic was the son of a cattle herder and the eighth of nine children.\nAt 17, he joined the Anyanya, one of the rebel groups that was fighting for southern independence during the First Sudanese Civil War in 1967. Sixteen years later - in the Second Sudanese Civil War - he was one of the five founding members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement.\nThe former rebel commander, who specialised in military intelligence, was seen as a moderate within the SPLM and became its leader in 2005 after the death of John Garang in a helicopter crash\nHe became president of South Sudan on independence and has remained in that position for 14 years as no elections have taken place.\nNicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, has warned the country is \"teetering on the brink of a return to full-scale civil war\", which would devastate the nation that is still dealing with the aftermath of the last conflict.\nThere are concerns that a return to fighting could lead to \"proxy warfare in the region\", according to Daniel Akech, an analyst at the Crisis Group think-tank.\n\"South Sudan is filled with so many armed groups, they're all seeming to be gearing up for military engagement.\"\nThe war in neighbouring Sudan adds another element of instability.\nThe leaders of the members of the regional grouping Igad \u2013 including Uganda - are supposed to be the guarantors of the 2018 deal.\nUganda's President Yoweri Museveni was in Juba recently and met Kiir, but the outcome of their discussions is not known.\nUgandan troops were also deployed to the country last month. South Sudan's government said the deployment was part of a long-standing agreement with its neighbour and the soldiers are there to support the army. \nAn African Union delegation was also in the capital and, as well as talking to the president, diplomats hoped to sit down with Machar \u2013 but that did not happen. There has been not a statement from the AU in the wake of the visit.\nWestern embassies \u2013 including the US and the UK \u2013 have released statements calling for the de-escalation of tensions, but it is not clear what impact these have had.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

Europe will continue to reach out to partners and maintain strong pressure on Russia until the bloodshed ends and a just and lasting peace is achieved, on Ukraine's terms and conditions.\"\nBritish Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also gave a view, saying he was \"appalled at Russia's horrific attacks on civilians in Sumy\".\nA spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he was \"deeply alarmed and shocked\" to learn of the missile attack.\n\"Attacks against civilians and civilian objects are prohibited under international humanitarian law, and that any such attacks, wherever they occur, must end immediately\", he added. \nGuterres stressed the UN's support for \"meaningful efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive peace that fully upholds Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity\".\nSunday's double missile strike was the deadliest attack on civilians in Ukraine this year.\nAnother Russian missile attack, earlier this month on 4 April, killed 20 people and injured 61 in the city of Kryvyi Rih.\nOn that occasion, Russia's defence ministry said it had targeted a meeting of \"unit commanders and Western instructors\" in a restaurant. No evidence was provided.\nIt is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. \nThe UN estimates that nearly seven million Ukrainians are currently living as refugees.\nThe conflict goes back more than a decade, to 2014, when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown. Russia then annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed insurgents in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.     ",

Ukraine's allies condemn Russia over deadly missile attackJust nowShareSavePatrick JacksonBBC NewsReporting fromLondonShareSaveFootage shows widespread damage in Sumy missile attacksA Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Sumy, which killed 34 people - including two children - and injured 117 others, has been strongly condemned by Kyiv's Western allies.Two ballistic missiles struck the city centre mid-morning on Sunday, exploding near the state university and congress centre, leaving bloodied bodies scattered in the streets.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the attack \"horrifying\" while Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, accused Russia of committing a war crime.There was no immediate official comment on the attack from Russia, whose forces  across the nearby border are said to be preparing for a major offensive. \"Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,\" he said on Sunday in an interview for CBS's 60 Minutes programme.Offering his condolences to the victims' loved ones, Rubio, the US secretary of state, said the attack was a \"tragic reminder\" of why the Trump administration was \"putting so much time and effort into trying to end this war\".Earlier, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, retired Lt-Gen Keith Kellogg, used stronger language, saying the attack had crossed \"any line of decency\".Merz, who is expected to take over as Germany's new chancellor next month, told  German public broadcaster ARD that the attack on Sumy constituted a \"serious war crime\".",

        "article_text": "US envoy Steve Witkoff met Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Friday, as Donald Trump urged the Russian president to \"get moving\" on a ceasefire in Ukraine.\nThe Kremlin said the meeting lasted for more than four hours and focused on \"aspects of a Ukrainian settlement\". The talks, Witkoff's third with Putin this year, were described by special envoy Kirill Dmitriev as \"productive\".  \nTrump has expressed frustration with Putin over the state of talks. On Friday, he wrote on social media: \"Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war.\" \nIt comes as Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg denied suggesting the country could be partitioned.\nThe Times said that, during an interview with the paper, Kellogg had proposed British and French troops could adopt zones of control in the west of Ukraine as part of a \"reassurance force\".\nRussia's army, he reportedly suggested, could then remain in the occupied east. \"You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two\", the paper quoted him as saying.\nKellogg later took to social media to say the article had \"misrepresented\" what he said. \"I was speaking of a post-ceasefire resiliency force in support of Ukraine's sovereignty,\" he wrote on X, adding: \"I was NOT referring to a partitioning of Ukraine.\"\nNeither the White House nor Kyiv reacted to the comments immediately. The BBC has asked the Times for its response.\nEarlier on Friday, European nations agreed \u20ac21bn ($24bn; \u00a318bn) in military aid for Kyiv.\nAt the event, Europe's defence ministers said they saw no sign of an end to the war.\nAhead of the Putin-Witkoff talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was \"no need to expect breakthroughs\" as the \"process of normalising relations is ongoing\".\nAsked whether discussions could include setting up a date for Putin and Trump to meet, Peskov said: \"Let's see. It depends on what Witkoff has come with.\"\nBeforehand, Witkoff had a meeting with Dmitriev at the Grand Hotel Europe in St Petersburg, where a conference was held on stainless steel and the Russian market. \nDmitriev, the 49-year-old head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, visited Washington last week and was the most senior Russian official to go to the US since the country's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nMeanwhile Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war during a visit on Friday to the site of a 4 April Russian missile attack on his home town of Kryvyi Rih. The attack killed 19 people, including nine children.\nHe also alleged that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting with the Russian army. It comes after Ukraine said it had captured two Chinese nationals.\n\"We have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia's occupation forces,\" Zelensky said.\n\"This means Russia is clearly trying to prolong the war even by using Chinese lives.\"\nZelensky laid flowers in front of photos of Herman Tripolets, nine, and seven-year-olds Arina Samodina and Radyslav Yatsko.\nHe later reiterated a call for air defence systems \"to protect lives and our cities\".\n\"We discussed this with President Trump - Ukraine is not just asking, we're ready to purchase these additional systems,\" he wrote on social media.\n\"Only powerful weapons can truly be relied upon to protect life when you have a neighbour like Russia.\"\nTrump has previously claimed he could end the Ukraine-Russia conflict \"in 24 hours\". On Friday, he declared that it would not have happened at all if he'd been in the White House in 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\n\"A war that should ld [sic] have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!,\" he wrote.\nIn February US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia for their first face-to-face talks since the invasion. Officials have also been meeting to discuss restoring full diplomatic relations.\nTrump has also had a fractious relationship with Zelensky since his second term as US president began, culminating in an angry confrontation in the Oval Office in February.\nThe US attempted to broker a limited ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, only for it to stall when the Kremlin asked for sanctions imposed after it launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour to be lifted.\nTrump has since said he is \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" with Putin over the lack of progress in agreeing a truce between Kyiv and Moscow.\nRussia's ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the US is not its ally.\nHe said America and Russia had not been able to go from \"total distrust to alignment in two months\" since Trump returned to the White House.\n\"We have too many disagreements,\" he said. \"But we are working on these disagreements step by step in different areas.\"\nEarlier this week, Washington and Moscow went ahead with a prisoner swap. \nKsenia Karelina, a Russian-American, was sentenced to 12 years in jail in Russia for donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity when the war began in February 2022.     \nThe Los Angeles resident was freed on Thursday morning and exchanged for Arthur Petrov, a dual German-Russian citizen arrested in Cyprus in 2023. \nHe was accused of illegally exporting microelectronics to Russia for manufacturers working with the military.",

        "article_text": "When his camera stopped working on his iPhone recently, New Yorker Richard Medina didn't waste any time. With the threat of tariff-fuelled price hikes on smartphones bearing down, he quickly called his phone company for a new one. \n\"I said, 'We've got to switch this out now,'\" the 43-year-old recalled. \"Let's take care of it.\"\nThe move was a sign of the pressure rising across the US, where households are being buffeted by what could be staggering price rises, and even possible shortages triggered by the sweeping tariffs that US President Donald Trump announced this month. \nSome are trying to stock up. Others say they feel paralysed by the changes, which have come quickly, or hope Trump will change his mind and reverse course - not an entirely unreasonable hope given the rapid changes in policy. \nTrump, facing financial market revolt over his latest tariffs, has already altered his plans repeatedly. \nFirst, he scaled back duties that had been planned on some countries, such as the European Union, in what was described as a 90-day pause. \nThen, as market turmoil continued, he exempted smartphones and other electronics from the duties, announcing the carve-out just a few days after Mr Medina felt pressure to make a purchase.  \n\"I can't keep up with the president. Every day is something new,\" said Anna Woods, 42, who recently received a message from her son's summer camp warning that the tariffs might affect pricing of standard gear such as T-shirts. \nThe 42-year-old, who works in legal operations, says she is nervous but unclear how to proceed. \n\"I just feel like we're living in uncertain times,\" she said, adding: \"I do need to make some purchases .... Everything is going up.\" \nThe latest tariffs include a 10% tax on the vast majority of imports - and an eye-popping 145% duty on goods from China, which is the third biggest supplier of imports to the US after the European Union and Mexico and a key source of essentials such as smartphones, shoes and umbrellas.\nThe measures followed previous orders that added 25% levies on cars, steel, aluminium and some goods from Canada and Mexico. \nIn all, Trump's orders have pushed the average effective tariff rate on imports in the US to the highest level in more than a century.\nIn stores, the immediate impact has been limited, since many firms stockpiled some products in anticipation of some tariffs. \nBut the tariffs are widely expected to lead to higher prices in the months ahead, especially for items such as clothing, leather goods, electronics and toys, many of which are made in China.\nThe Budget Lab at Yale forecasts that prices for clothing could soar by more than 60% in the short run; basic pharmaceutical products could jump by 12%, and food prices rise by 2.6%.\nAll told, the typical US family is facing a roughly $4,700 jump in costs due to the new taxes, if purchase patterns remain the same, it estimates.\n\"I'm extremely worried about it,\" said 38-year-old mother Jamie Casey, one of more than a dozen people shopping at a Target in Brooklyn on a recent afternoon who shared their thoughts with the BBC about the tariffs. \nShe was in the store picking up formula - and some onesies and outfits for her daughter, who has yet to turn one.  \n\"I wouldn't say I'm panic-buying yet, but I am interested in how it plays out.\"\nMajor retailers experienced a jump in visits in the weeks leading up to Trump's tariff announcement, according to research firm Placer.ai, while purchases at the likes of Walmart and Target increased markedly in the immediate aftermath, according to data tracked by ConsumerEdge. \nThere has also been an uptick in US purchases on Amazon's e-commerce platform, where Chinese sellers dominate, CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC recently. \n\"I don't know if we can necessarily conclude it's panic-buying but there seems to be broad stock-up behaviour,\" said Michael Gunther, head of insights at ConsumerEdge, noting that two separate data sets used by the firm showed a pick-up.\nCristina Montoya said she had been buying extra canned food and frozen fruit, a little at a time for a few months, anxious about possible price increases, especially as a pensioner reliant on a fixed income.\n\"You never used to do your shopping nervous,\" the 74-year-old said. \"I feel like you have to buy a lot of things because you don't know what's going to happen.\" \nThe dynamic has added to the tariff turmoil.\nLast week, as the measures came into effect, some businesses started introducing tariff surcharges, while others abruptly cancelled shipments from China, unwilling to risk being unable to recoup the cost of the duties.\nThe disruption has the potential to cause near-term shortages in the US of items where China dominates the supply, such as baby carriages, colouring books and umbrellas, analysts at Macquarie noted this week. \nAnalysts say the pickup in consumer purchases is likely to prove temporary, or an acceleration of transactions that would have happened anyway.\nIf price rises start to hit, many economists expect Americans to opt for cheaper substitutes, delay purchases, or simply do without - a pullback with major consequences for an economy driven by consumer spending.\nKathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, is predicting the US economy will grow just 0.5% this year, and the unemployment rate will rise to 5% - the highest level since 2021 amid Covid. \nOther firms, such as JP Morgan, are forecasting an outright recession. \n\"In terms of the consumer, it does get a little tricky,\" Ms Bostjancic said.\n\"We could see consumer spending actually be strong in March and April but it's just because of this surge ahead of the tariff increases,\" she added. \"Going forward, consumer spending is going to be weaker.\"\nOn surveys, fears about both the economy and price rises are flaring, even though hiring has been solid and inflation cooled to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February.\nSome people shopping in New York said it felt like a whole way of life could be coming to an end. \nLouis Lopez, an elevator mechanic in New York City, said he was so worried about the economy he had started to squirrel away cash under the mattress. But he was also holding shopping bags with new work clothes and a pair of Nike trainers for the summer.\n\"You might as well buy it now ... while you have it good,\" the 56-year-old said. \"It's going to change everything for everybody.\"",

        "article_text": "A new Universal theme park near Bedford - the first in Europe - was announced to much fanfare earlier this week.\nSet to open in 2031, construction is to begin at the 476-acre site, where attractions are likely to feature James Bond, Paddington and The Lord of the Rings. \nBut from deciding how many loops to include on a coaster, to making sure even the trees blend in seamlessly with an area's design, building a dream world is a painstaking task. \nTo find out what planning lies behind the thrills, and what sort of things we could expect when the new Universal park finally arrives, BBC News spoke to some real-life rollercoaster experts.\nOf course, any good theme park needs some good rides - but maybe it's an understatement to say that's a tall order. \nWhile \"at least two or three iconic rides\" are needed, these need not necessarily be the fastest, tallest or most innovative to stand out, explains Andy Sinclair-Harris, creative director at Katapult, which has designed attractions for the likes of Legoland and Alton Towers.\n\"What is more important is the depth of storytelling,\" he says, so that you're fully immersed in the experience of the ride.\nA good example, he says, is a Harry-Potter-themed rollercoaster called Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, located at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal's Orlando resort. Riders sit in replicas of Hagrid's motorbike and zoom through recreations of settings from the popular film series.\n\"There's nothing particularly brand new or absolutely amazing about that ride, other than it tells a story amazingly well,\" he adds.\nIf the rumours that there's going to be a Back to the Future ride at Universal's UK venture are true, those behind it will be ensuring that the DeLorean time machine is included, he says.\nDuring the brainstorming part of building a resort, rides are often \"developed as storytelling tools\" in a \"specific genre or world,\" says Joseph Bright, CEO at Scruffy Dog, which provides creative project management for theme parks.\nWhile an iconic ride might help to \"anchor\" a zone of a park, \"it's never developed in isolation\" - rather \"cohesion is critical [and] every element...must serve the wider guest story\".\nDennis Speigel, founder of International Theme Park Services, says meticulous planning goes into the most immersive rides.\nHe adds that the size of a rollercoaster is partly dictated by the number of guests its designers hope to get on board - \"between 1,500 and 2,000 an hour\" at popular parks.\nUsually, that means a coaster that is over 3,000ft (914m) long, with the first dip \"somewhere in the 150ft (45m) range\".\nMr Speigel says that while an upcoming coaster at Six Flags Qiddiya in Saudi Arabia is set to break records when it sends riders speeding at over 150mph around the tracks, most coasters today reach between 70-90mph on their first drop.  \nOnce the larger rides are planned out, theme park designers then consider what he describes as \"flat rides\", which cater to less thrill-seeking crowds.\n\"Those are your smaller rides that take people around and around, like a merry-go-round or a monster,\" he says. \"[They're] rides that can often be bought off the shelf from a manufacturer\".\nWhen you step foot in a theme park, you're probably thinking about the rides you'll be going on - but you might think less about how you get there.\nDuring the design phase, you have to let your imagination run wild, says Mr Sinclair-Harris. \"Budget is a thing, but when you have those first initial discussions, you shouldn't be tempered by anything,\" he says.\nThe \"story\" of your park is crucial, he adds. \"It's knowing the story, the characters and being true to that world.\"\nOf course, discussions about details like potential ride dimensions and manufacturers soon follow, as well as a masterplan, which configures how attractions, pathways and amenities would all fit into the space - and often determines how long people will end up queuing for.\nAn artist's conception of the Universal UK park depicts a huge lake in middle of what appears to be different themed areas. Far from just looking pretty, it can allow crowds to fan out to multiple rides without congestion forming around one.\nAt Alton Towers, theme park vlogger and fanatic Charlotte Branford - known as Diary of a RollerCoaster Girl - believes it means other visitors often choose to go left around the lake (to the Wicker Man ride), or right around it (towards the Smiler), so she heads to the back of the park to try to avoid the crowds.\nIt's here at the back of parks designed in this way, that you'll often find a show with set times \"to try and stop people running around to the back of the park to get to some big attraction,\" says Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club, who has been involved in rollercoaster designs.\n\"Without realising it, they're trying to make you do roughly what they want you to do when you're in the park.\"\nAnother tried and tested layout is the \"hub and spoke\" often seen at Disneyland resorts, says Robbie Jones, insights director at Katapult.\n\"In a sense you've got that central gathering point...like the castle in the Magic Kingdom...with different lands like spokes on a wheel, radiating out.\"\nUniversal's new Epic Universe theme park in Orlando will follow a version of this - allowing you to venture into different lands through portals.\nSo the stories behind the rollercoasters are intertwined with the story of the theme park layout itself.\nThen come the finishing touches - to maintain your sense of being in a futuristic or fantasy world while you're there.\nTrees, artificial rock or even other buildings are often used to obscure unsightly but necessary objects, Mr Sinclair-Harris says. \"If you're in an amazing world with castles and dragons, seeing a telephone pole removes you from that story\".\nEven the audio playing out, scent of a park and queue lines are considered because they \"play a role in that illusion,\" says Mr Bright.\nAs Mr Garvanovic puts it, \"there's tons of subtle stuff going on in the background\" in a well thought-out theme park.\nThe sign of success, perhaps, is when you barely even notice it.",

        "article_text": "As a former champion runner, Richard McDonald can move quickly. \nBut the speed of the market falls, triggered by the sweeping global tariffs Donald Trump announced last week, still kept him on his toes.\nPreviously a trader for Credit Suisse, he now buys and sells stocks privately. At his laptop in London last week, he watched as the president unveiled a poster board outlining tariff rates, some as high as 50%, for imports from countries around the world.\nHe raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold. \n\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first',\" he said. \"My mind was sprinting.\"\nIn 25 years of trading, he said he had rarely experienced anything like it.\nTrillions were wiped off the value of financial markets around the world in the aftermath of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement. \nLeading share indexes in the US and UK saw some of the steepest declines since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, dropping more than 10% over three days. \nOil prices sank and so did the dollar. \nBy Wednesday, the worries had spread to the bond market, as investors started dumping US government debt, usually a safe haven for investors in times of uncertainty.\nWhen Trump announced he was putting some of the most eye-watering tariffs on pause, shares stopped sliding and rallied. \nBut the market turmoil was far from over. \nTrump left in place a tariff of 10% on imports from most countries and a tariff of 145% on goods from China, America's third largest source of imports after the European Union and Mexico.\nA day after the announcement, the S&P 500 dropped another 3.5%, the Dow slid 2.5% and the Nasdaq fell 4.3%.\nAt St Louis-based Argent Capital Management, the mood, said portfolio manager Jed Ellerbroek, was \"still miserable\".\nSome of his firm's holdings, like health insurance giant United Healthcare, have done well over the last week, as investors look for companies likely to be able to weather the tariff storm.\nBut his third largest investment is Apple, which makes the majority of its iPhones and other products in China.\n\"Trump has induced a gigantic amount of uncertainty into the global economy and consumers and investors and business managers are reeling and unable to make long-term decisions,\" Mr Ellerboek said. \n\"We are really on hold, because we only trade when we have high conviction levels,\" he said.\n\"What do we do with Apple? I don't know. I'm not going to change when I have no clue what the tariff rate is going to be next week,\" he said. \nFaced with so many uncertainties, some investors are simply quitting the market, said John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics.\n\"What you're looking at, broadly speaking, is a market that is frustrated, uncertain and confused about where we're going to be one day to the next,\" he said.  \"In that environment you have a tendency to see some investors choosing the safety of cash.\"\nWhile Trump's tariff rollback was a \"relief\", he said it did not change the bigger picture: firms in the US that are bringing in parts or products are facing significantly higher import taxes than they were at the start of the year. \n\"The tariffs that remain are still high enough that they are likely to push up inflation and weigh significantly on the economy as we go forward,\" he said.\n\"We're just back trading again on the broader long-term outlook of the tariff implications, which is still negative.\"",

        "article_text": "The resentencing hearing of Menendez brothers can move forward despite opposition from the district attorney, a Los Angeles court has ruled.\nThe brothers' attorneys are attempting to have them resentenced to a lesser term, which could potentially make them eligible for freedom.\nErik and Lyle were convicted of killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989, a notorious case that still divides Americans. They are currently serving life in prison without the possibility of parole in California.\nFriday's ruling means a pair of high-profile hearings next week to decide whether the convicted killers will be resentenced,  will continue. \nLos Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman has voiced fierce opposition to resentencing the pair, after his predecessor put the process in motion just before the November election.\nThe brothers' effort is based on a California law that allows certain inmates who were aged under 26 at the time of their crimes to seek resentencing and potential parole eligibility - recognising that brain development continues into a person's mid-20s.\nIf the brothers are resentenced to 50 years to life as they have requested, it would make them immediately eligible for parole.\nLyle and Erik Menendez appeared for hearing remotely via a video stream from a San Diego prison. Both were dressed in blue prison jumpsuits and appeared nervous at times - looking down, rocking in chairs and taking deep breaths - as prosecutors recounted graphic details of the killings.\nThe district attorney's office argued that while prosecutors can recognise inmates have rehabilitated while behind bars, the act of resentencing someone should be used with care.\nDeputy District Attorney Habib Balian criticised the former DA George Gasc\u00f3n, whose backing of the resentencing effort allowed it to move forward. \nHe said the decision by Gasc\u00f3n to announce his support for the brothers to be resentenced just before the November election, which Gasc\u00f3n lost to Hochman by a wide margin, was politically driven.\nThe DA's office has argued the brothers have not fully taken responsibility and have continued to grasp at alleged lies in the case to shed blame.\nMark Geragos, an attorney for the Menendez brothers, argued that the district attorney's office was more concerned with re-litigating the previous trial and hadn't examined what the pair had been doing the last 35 years in prison. \nThe pair had completed schooling while behind bars and worked to start rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates, along with incarcerated individuals suffering with trauma, he said.\nThe judge ruled that prosecutors failed to show why the resentencing effort should not continue and emphasised the importance of maintaining consistency even with shifts in leadership.\n\"There's no new information,\" the judge said. \"None of this is really new. They've stuck with their story. It goes to whether they've been rehabilitated.\"\nThe case was thrust back into the public eye last year as new evidence emerged and the release of a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story.\nThe series introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released.\nLegal experts say the outcome of the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing could take several forms, depending on how the judge rules. \nThe most straightforward path would be to deny resentencing altogether, leaving their current sentence\u2014life without the possibility of parole\u2014intact. This is the outcome Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman is pushing for, arguing the brothers have not fully accepted responsibility for their crimes and therefore don't qualify for a reduced sentence.\nAlternatively, the court could side with former DA George Gasc\u00f3n's earlier recommendation and resentence the brothers to 50 years to life. This would make them immediately eligible for parole, as they've already served more than 30 years. But eligibility doesn't guarantee release; they would still need to convince a parole board they are no longer a danger to society.\nAnother possibility is that the judge opts for a modified sentence that reduces their punishment but does not immediately open the door to parole. In that case, the brothers could face several more years behind bars before becoming eligible.\nThe resentencing bid is one of three routes the brothers have been chasing in recent months in hopes of being freed.\nCalifornia Gov Gavin Newsom is still weighing another option: granting the brothers clemency.\nNewsom said the brothers were scheduled to appear before the state's parole board on 13 June to discuss the findings of a risk assessment he'd ordered, examining whether Erik and Lyle pose a danger to society.\nDepending on the results, the governor could grant clemency, commuting their sentences to make them eligible for parole or even releasing them outright.\nThe third route the brothers have eyed - asking for a new trial - hit a roadblock when Hochman's office announced they would oppose the request.",

Never say never.\"\nDuring the episode, Lamb - who speaks five languages and worked in selling encyclopaedias and in the energy industry before embarking on acting - opened up about everything from his \"difficult and unhappy\" childhood, to his most recent endeavor of writing his debut novel.\nGavin and Stacey, which was co-written by Ruth Jones and James Corden and began in 2007, followed the story of a girl from south Wales and a boy from Essex who fell in love, and the ups and downs of their worlds colliding.\nThe series officially ended with a grand finale Christmas Day episode last year.\n\"It was the most extraordinary experience of my life, going through the whole of that and then, particularly, that end. It was just amazing,\" said Lamb, who played Gavin's father Mick.\n\"I was never convinced that it was going to be the end [but] now that it's all done... I feel no frustration about wanting to go on with it.\"\nThe record-breaking Gavin and Stacey finale has bagged an array of Bafta nominations, including one for the Memorable Moment Award.\nThe wedding scene, and in particular when Corden's character Smithy waits for Mick's opinion on whether he should go through with marrying his fianc\u00e9 Sonia, really hit home with fans.\n\"Fifty years as an actor, and I have a scene where I don't say anything and all I do is stand up. I get more feedback off that than I have in fifty years of acting,\" said Lamb.\n\"Playing the King in Hamlet, TV series, musicals and [I just needed to] stand up,\" he joked.\nLamb admitted Mick Shipman developed into a character he himself wanted to be, unlike some of his other roles.\n\"You certainly wouldn't want to be Archie Mitchell [in EastEnders], you'd spend your life trying to get shot of him.\"\nHe said filming for Gavin and Stacey originally began as we was entering his 60s and \"was just beginning to calm down and become a bit more of a regular, run-of-the-mill human being\".\n\"Wild days were over and I'd stopped drinking,\" he said.\n\"Dear old Mick came along and so I played Mick through my sixties and into my seventies. I began to take Mick on board. I certainly didn't realise I was taking Mick on board, I was just a much more bearable person to be around and much more bearable for me to live with.\n\"I remember George, my boy, saying to me, 'you're an old geezer now, you better start learning to enjoy it' and that's what I started to do.\"\nHe said Mick was \"a happy go-lucky guy\" who dealt with problems as they cropped up but \"always looked on the bright side\" and enjoyed life.\nHe added Mick had to \"learn how to be a diplomat\" while living with \"Mrs chaos\" - his eccentric wife, Pam - but that the couple were \"absolutely madly in love\".\n\"There's nothing that's going to rock their boat\u2026 what they wrote was this absolutely perfect couple who know how to work around each other, no matter what goes on.\"\nLamb said he definitely wanted to keep working, but was often not the \"first choice\" for parts, because casting directors knew people saw him as Mick Shipman.\n\"Characters like Mick Shipman are pretty difficult to act your way around,\" he said.\n\"But I've done a few things over the last year where I play somebody's dad or the older part of it and they're not massive commitments time wise but what they are is interesting jobs, interesting relationships.\n\"Those sort of parts are attractive to me.\"",

        "article_text": "CCTV footage shows the dramatic moment a bomb exploded in central Athens, damaging the offices of Greek railway company Hellenic Train.\nA backpack containing the explosive was reportedly left outside the office block late on Friday. Police said anonymous calls were made to Greek media outlets warning of the attack. No fatalities or injuries have been reported.\nThough the cause of the explosion is not yet known, it comes amid widespread anger over a railway disaster that left 57 dead in 2023.\nGreece's Transport Minister Christos Dimas condemned the explosion as a \"criminal act\" that had \"endangered the lives of people\".\nLocal news outlets Efsyn, a Greek daily newspaper, and website Zougla - both of which received a call - said the explosive device had apparently been placed in a padlocked backpack on a scooter without licence plates.\nA police bomb disposal squad arrived too late to safely detonate the device before it exploded, they said. \nDimas said in a statement: \"This is a criminal act, which endangered the lives of people, employees and passers-by, in a central point of Athens and during peak traffic hour.\"\nHe added: \"Nothing justifies terrorism, no act of violence brings justice. The authorities and the judiciary now have the floor.\"\nThe explosion occurred close to one of the Greek capital's busiest highways, Leoforos Andrea Siggrou.\nHellenic Train confirmed no employees or passing citizens were injured and that the blast caused \"limited material damage\".\nIt said: \"Our company unequivocally condemns all forms of violence and tensions that fuel a climate of toxicity that undermines all progress.\"\nIn February 2023, a freight train and a passenger train carrying 350 people travelling in opposite directions were accidentally put on the same track. Most of the people killed were young students, while dozens were injured.\nMultiple protests have been held in Greece since, including earlier this year to mark the crash's second anniversary. \nThose demonstrations descended into violence, with hooded protesters seen throwing rocks and petrol bombs at police. Officers responded with tear gas and water cannons.\nAn inquiry concluded in February that the train crash was caused by human error, poor maintenance and inadequate staffing.\nA date for a trial is yet to be announced.

Researchers have also been investigating environmental factors.\nThe US National Institutes of Health (NIH), a government agency, spends more than $300m (\u00a3230m) per year researching autism. \nThe NIH lists some possible risk factors including prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, premature birth or low birth weight, maternal health problems and parents conceiving at older ages.\nKennedy did not give details on the research project or how much funding will be devoted to autism research. \nSince being sworn in two months ago, the former environmental lawyer has slashed the budget for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which includes the NIH, CDC and other government health organisations that oversee food and drug safety and conduct disease research.\n\"We're going to look at vaccines, but we're going to look at everything,\" Kennedy later said during an interview with Fox News about the scope of the undertaking. \"Everything is on the table, our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting, all the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic.\"\nIn a statement the Autism Society of America called Kennedy's plan \"harmful, misleading, and unrealistic\".\n\"It is neither a chronic illness nor a contagion,\" the society said.\nChristopher Banks, the society's president, questioned whether the research efforts would be transparent and said claims that autism is solely caused by environmental factors were \"misleading theories (which) perpetuate harmful stigma, jeopardize public health, and distract from the critical needs of the autism community.\"\nKennedy has also alarmed some over his hiring of David Geier, who has been described by some as a conspiracy theorist, to research vaccines and autism, and on Thursday Democrats in the US House of Representatives wrote to HHS  \"to express our urgent concern\" over the selection of \"a biased and discredited individual\". \nGeier is a leading vaccine sceptic who was fined by the state of Maryland for practicing medicine without a medical degree or licence and prescribing dangerous treatments to autistic children.\nThe discredited idea that childhood vaccines are linked to autism first gained mainstream attention after a paper published in 1998 in the medical journal The Lancet by British doctor Andrew Wakefield.\nWakefield was later found to have financial conflicts of interest and the UK's General Medical Council found that he falsified his results. The research paper was retracted.",

        "article_text": "Since joining Manchester United in summer 2023, Andre Onana has made more mistakes in all competitions than any other Premier League goalkeeper\nWar of the words, power of the press conference. In what felt like a trade of verbal blows from a bygone era, Lyon midfielder Nemanja Matic's jibe that Andre Onana is \"one of the worst goalkeepers\" in Manchester United history set the tone for Thursday's Europa League meeting.\nOnana was then at fault for both Lyon's goals in his side's 2-2 draw in the quarter-final first leg - just a day after those comments from former Red Devils player Matic.\nIt means that since the start of last season, Onana has made eight errors leading to goals in all competitions, the most of any keeper playing for a Premier League club.\nBoss Ruben Amorim looked to take the spotlight off his goalkeeper by suggesting he is the one who has made more mistakes than his players this season. \nBut there is no avoiding the questions - did Matic's comments affect Onana's performance on Thursday night? Was playing mind games his intention all along? And how does Onana rebuild his confidence before facing Lyon again next week?\n\"If you get another high-profile player who comes out with a comment like that, despite how much shielding they do, he is going to know it,\" says chartered psychologist Dr Simon Moore.\n\"They're all on social media, they have all got phones and he is not going to be able to avoid it. It will get in his head, because no matter how hard he tries to park it and move on, it will bug him.\n\"The other thing is, you get this reaction of 'well I am going to go out and show everybody that I don't make mistakes and I am over it'. And that puts even more pressure and duress on you to achieve that.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'One of the worst keepers in Man Utd history' - Matic on Onana\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, Matic was asked about Onana's comments from earlier this week that United were \"way better\" than French club Lyon.\nSerbian Matic, who played for United from 2017-2022, responded: \"You know, I respect everyone but to say that then you need to give the answer.\n\"If you are one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's history, you need to take care what you're talking about.\n\"If it was [Edwin] Van der Sar, [Peter] Schmeichel or [David] De Gea saying that, then I would question myself. But you need to have cover to say something like that.\"\nOnana then posted on social media to deny he was being disrespectful.\n\"I would never be disrespectful to another club. We know that tomorrow will be a difficult game against a strong opponent,\" Onana said on X.\n\"We focus on preparing a performance to make our fans proud.\n\"At least I've lifted trophies with the greatest club in the world. Some can't say the same.\"\nThis video can not be played\nOnana given vote of confidence by Amorim after errors\n\"He was in the headlines before the game and now he is going to be all over the headlines again,\" said former England winger Aaron Lennon on BBC Radio 5 Live following Onana's errors against Lyon. \n\"I think he looks a bit silly tonight and Matic is probably the one who is going to sleep well,\" added former Lyon and England midfielder Izzy Christiansen.\nMoore, who co-hosts the What's Your Goal podcast alongside former England midfielder Katie Chapman, says the brain is wired to pay specific attention to risk, threat and mistakes from an \"ego, status and reputation point of view\".\n\"Given the fact he is a goalkeeper at a very famous club and there is a lot of pressure on shoulders anyway within that team, they have had a lot of negative media throughout the year, he is going to have a double whammy effect,\" Moore says.\n\"What you are doing is signalling to your brain, rather than 'how can I do well?', is 'how can I avoid a mistake?'.\"\nMatt Shaw is a chartered sports psychologist at InnerDrive, who work with players from senior internationals to academy level.\n\"We often talk about external noise and trying to limit it as much as possible,\" says Shaw. \"In some sense, it could be a coincidence those comments were made and then he had a poor performance.\n\"You might look at other times this season where no comments were made and he had good or bad performances after that as well.\"\nShaw says what is being said off the pitch can often be \"overhyped\" because of its importance to fans and the media, rather than the players themselves.\n\"A lot of these guys, it is water off a duck's back,\" he explains. \"When it does impact players it's really interesting, because we often forget they are experts in what they do - experts can have poor performance - but also in terms of how they handle those situations.\n\"You see Onana pre-match going straight up to the fans in front of the net, where it looked like it didn't really affect him at all. It can affect these guys, but often it doesn't.\n\"When we are working with players, we are working with them all the time and trying to keep them at a baseline. It is easy to draw a straight line and say lots of stuff happened pre-match and he went on to make mistakes that led to goals. Whereas the chances are, once the game starts, it is very unlikely that is in his mind because he has way more to focus on.\n\"What we always want is players thinking in a helpful way, what do they need to think about and focus in order to perform well? Obviously comments beforehand about being United's poorest goalkeeper aren't the comments we want him thinking about. But I would be surprised if those were in his mind.\"\n'I've made more mistakes than them' - Amorim defends Onana after errors\nHow does Onana compare to other Man Utd keepers after Matic criticism?\nSo what can Onana, and United's backroom staff, do to help focus him going forward?\n\"I would remind him of all the positive things he's been doing, bombard him with all the clips,\" says Moore. \"He's a great stopper, his reflexes are amazing, so remind him.\n\"That will give him confidence, and then maybe play the clips back and say these are areas we need to work on.\n\"Football is a creative sport, that is great for the fan because you get lots of exciting moments, but creativity also means you are going to fail a lot - that is the nature of creativity. He has got to accept he is an industry that oscillates between 'wow' moments and moments you make mistakes.\"\nShaw says, after a debrief, it is about focusing on the action plan going forwards.\n\"And then it's about going into training and practising those things or stripping it all the way back to 'OK, what am I good at? What is the part of the game that makes me who I am as a goalkeeper?' and just focusing on those things instead,\" he adds.\nThe one-week turnaround before facing Lyon in the second leg may seem tight, but Shaw says in football terms that is plenty of time to move on - and Manchester United have another game, at Newcastle on Sunday, to think about first anyway.\n\"The goalkeeper team will be quite tight,\" he adds.\n\"They will be getting around him and then really going back to what they enjoy doing in training and just trying to make sure he is successful in training so it builds some confidence over the course of the week, as well as having those conversations about what we do differently next time.\n\"In any of our walks of life, if something goes wrong, we expect people to get around us, having a little bit of a debrief with a focus on being better next time as opposed to not being good enough - then really just focusing on the things that make him a good goalkeeper and trying to expose those throughout the week.\"\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\nGet Man Utd news notifications",

        "article_text": "The young cast of Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza\u2019s film Warfare had to bond pretty quickly, to play a US military unit whose lives depended on each other, during the Iraq war in 2006.\nFamiliarity was crucial, so before filming began, the cast were sent on a three-week military bootcamp. \nThey lived together, learning military jargon and gun safety and were pushed beyond their limits - all of which brought them closer together.  \nFirst off though, they agreed to shave each other's heads to look the part, boosting trust and familiarity.\n\"We shaved our heads on day one, and got tattoos at the end of the process, so it bookended the experience,\" Poulter tells the BBC. \nThe actor, who recently appeared in The Bear and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, plays Captain Eric, who was part of a group of US soldiers and Iraqi scouts on a surveillance mission.\nWe see how it goes wrong, with devastating consequences.\nHeartstopper star Connor plays newcomer Tommy, hitting home how young the soldiers were - he's just turned 21, the same age Tommy was at the time.\nThe actor says the decision to get a shared tattoo with his castmates after filming wrapped was a \"no-brainer\". The casts of The Avengers and The Lord of the Rings did the same thing after their final films.\nWarfare's actors decided their tattoo would say \"Call On Me\", to reflect their brotherhood, while referencing Erik Prydz's 2004 dance hit, which kicks the film off. \nThe cast features some other big names, including Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Sh\u014dgun's Cosmo Jarvis, Stranger Things and the forthcoming Beatles biopic's Joseph Quinn, and Riverdale's Charles Melton.\n\"It was really formative for me,\" Connor says about his time  on the film. \"I've made friends I really do believe I will know for a long time.\n\"We all wanted to commemorate it - we are so proud of the work we've done together.\"\nThe movie is based entirely on a real-life mission that took place during the Iraq war, and is built on the memories of the US soldiers who were there.\nThe group was embedded in the home of an ordinary Iraqi family, who we briefly see in the film, in Ramadi - an area controlled by Al-Qaeda forces. \nThe military's goal had been to slip into and observe the area under the cover of darkness, to ensure the safe passage of ground forces there the next day. \nWhat they didn't know what that they were next door to an insurgent house, making them the target of an attack.\nShot in real-time, Warfare has no music or flashbacks, so there's no let-up for the audience. You're dropped into the thick of the action for the whole film.\nThe soldiers in command have to make split-second decisions amid the pain and chaos, with the Iraqi family caught in the crossfire.\nOscar nominee Garland, whose back catalogue includes the 28 Days film franchise and Ex Machina, got the idea for Warfare when he was making last year's film Civil War.\nHe was working on the battle scenes with Hollywood stunt man and gunfight co-ordinator Ray Mendoza.\n\"During the edit process of Civil War, I was able to really focus on some of the work Ray had done, and how sophisticated and how nuanced it was,\" Garland recalls.\nThey got chatting about Mendoza's previous life as a US Navy Seal, and about the Ramadi operation, where he was its communications officer. \nMendoza said he'd always wanted to make a film about that mission.\nThe veteran had a very big reason for wanting to recreate what happened that day - to help replace the lost memories of his colleague Elliott Miller. \nMiller, a former Navy Seal, was so badly injured in Ramadi that he suffered traumatic brain injury and memory loss, and had to have a leg amputated. \nDuring the mission, Mendoza carried the unconscious soldier to the rescue tank that ultimately saved his life.\n\"Elliott doesn't remember it, and when he woke up, he had a lot of questions,\" Mendoza says.\n\"No matter how many maps we drew, or how many times we wrote it out - without that core memory, I think he's had a hard time.\n\"It just raised more questions than answers. So I wanted to recreate this one.\"\nSo Garland and Mendoza decided to make Warfare together, sharing writing and directing credits, and dedicating the film to Miller.\nThe crucial question is whether seeing the film helped Miller piece things together. \n\"It did, yeah - he was a sponge,\" Mendoza says. \n\"We walked him through it - he had a lot of questions, he's got kids that have questions. \n\"It's now a film memory, but it's as close as he's gonna have \u2013 he's super grateful.\"\nMiller was played by Jarvis, who calls him \"a funny guy... he's great - a living embodiment of perseverance\". \nIt was a \"unique situation to be in when you're entrusted with portraying somebody that's sitting right across from you\", Jarvis said, about having the person he was playing actually on set. \n\"But because he didn't remember [what happened], a lot of my references had to come from his colleagues.\"\nThe soldiers' casting has caused some excitement online, with some publications breathily calling the actors \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" and \"red hot rising stars\".\nGarland arches an eyebrow at this, and Mendoza jumps in to talk about why those actors were chosen.\n\"I've said this to them, so I'm not trying to offend them, but we weren't looking for the best actors. They're all great actors. We were looking for the right actors,\" he says.\n\"So what that means is their willingness to push their bodies past a comfort level that they're maybe not used to. 'You're gonna be exhausted. You're gonna be required to rely on other people. It's not about you, it's about the team'.\n\"And the ones that jump at that opportunity, you're like, 'Yep, that's the attitude that we need'.\"\nCollating and cross-checking the soldiers' memories was a big job, largely undertaken by Garland.\n\"I think there's an inherent value in attempting to be honest and truthful about something as serious and significant as war,\" he says.\nHe shot the film in a studio in a suburb north of London, on a former World War Two airfield, making it in real-time to recreate \"a real incident of combat... as honestly, forensically and accurately as possible\".\nNot surprisingly, while sharing credits with Garland, former US Navy Seal Mendoza ran the actors' bootcamp. \nHe was played by Woon-A-Tai, who calls him \"a brilliant instructor who instilled a lot of confidence in us\", while also making gun safety a top priority. \nThe actor was also fascinated by the narrative not being \"dramatised or Hollywoodised\".\n\"To see these guys not obey orders - and do what they needed to save their platoon was interesting to me,\" he says, talking about the soldiers' evacuation process. \nMendoza thinks the film may also help veterans who are struggling to express what warfare can be like.\n\"Some of these things are harder to explain in words,\" he says. \"So art imagery is how I'm able to communicate that.\"\nConnor echoes this, saying: \"A lot of these men are very much less inclined to talk about themselves in these situations, whether it be to be due to humility, or a difficulty in really articulating it. \n\"A lot of them just don't really enjoy talking about their involvement.\"\nThe film has been called \"the most harrowing \u2013 and honest \u2013 depiction of modern combat ever made\" by the Telegraph, while the New Yorker said it offers a \"hyperrealist rebuke of the American war movie\". \nThe Guardian said the \"film-makers' message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battle\", while Empire added: \"It may well be cinema's most effective, purest anti-war film: there is no sentimentality, no hand-wringing, but most significantly not a second of it makes war look cool, or attractive.\"\nPoulter says he admires the film-makers' determination to make Warfare purely factual. \n\"Hopefully this film contributes to a better understanding of just how negative, and how the consequences of war are characterised by a lot of loss...\n\"I think this is as much an anti-war film as you can possibly hope to see.\"\nWarfare is out in cinemas on Friday, 18 April.",

        "article_text": "US envoy Steve Witkoff met Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Friday, as Donald Trump urged the Russian president to \"get moving\" on a ceasefire in Ukraine.\nThe Kremlin said the meeting lasted for more than four hours and focused on \"aspects of a Ukrainian settlement\". The talks, Witkoff's third with Putin this year, were described by special envoy Kirill Dmitriev as \"productive\".  \nTrump has expressed frustration with Putin over the state of talks. On Friday, he wrote on social media: \"Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war.\" \nIt comes as Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg denied suggesting the country could be partitioned.\nThe Times said that, during an interview with the paper, Kellogg had proposed British and French troops could adopt zones of control in the west of Ukraine as part of a \"reassurance force\".\nRussia's army, he reportedly suggested, could then remain in the occupied east. \"You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two\", the paper quoted him as saying.\nKellogg later took to social media to say the article had \"misrepresented\" what he said. \"I was speaking of a post-ceasefire resiliency force in support of Ukraine's sovereignty,\" he wrote on X, adding: \"I was NOT referring to a partitioning of Ukraine.\"\nNeither the White House nor Kyiv reacted to the comments immediately. The BBC has asked the Times for its response.\nEarlier on Friday, European nations agreed \u20ac21bn ($24bn; \u00a318bn) in military aid for Kyiv.\nAt the event, Europe's defence ministers said they saw no sign of an end to the war.\nAhead of the Putin-Witkoff talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was \"no need to expect breakthroughs\" as the \"process of normalising relations is ongoing\".\nAsked whether discussions could include setting up a date for Putin and Trump to meet, Peskov said: \"Let's see. It depends on what Witkoff has come with.\"\nBeforehand, Witkoff had a meeting with Dmitriev at the Grand Hotel Europe in St Petersburg, where a conference was held on stainless steel and the Russian market. \nDmitriev, the 49-year-old head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, visited Washington last week and was the most senior Russian official to go to the US since the country's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nMeanwhile Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war during a visit on Friday to the site of a 4 April Russian missile attack on his home town of Kryvyi Rih. The attack killed 19 people, including nine children.\nHe also alleged that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting with the Russian army. It comes after Ukraine said it had captured two Chinese nationals.\n\"We have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia's occupation forces,\" Zelensky said.\n\"This means Russia is clearly trying to prolong the war even by using Chinese lives.\"\nZelensky laid flowers in front of photos of Herman Tripolets, nine, and seven-year-olds Arina Samodina and Radyslav Yatsko.\nHe later reiterated a call for air defence systems \"to protect lives and our cities\".\n\"We discussed this with President Trump - Ukraine is not just asking, we're ready to purchase these additional systems,\" he wrote on social media.\n\"Only powerful weapons can truly be relied upon to protect life when you have a neighbour like Russia.\"\nTrump has previously claimed he could end the Ukraine-Russia conflict \"in 24 hours\". On Friday, he declared that it would not have happened at all if he'd been in the White House in 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\n\"A war that should ld [sic] have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!,\" he wrote.\nIn February US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia for their first face-to-face talks since the invasion. Officials have also been meeting to discuss restoring full diplomatic relations.\nTrump has also had a fractious relationship with Zelensky since his second term as US president began, culminating in an angry confrontation in the Oval Office in February.\nThe US attempted to broker a limited ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, only for it to stall when the Kremlin asked for sanctions imposed after it launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour to be lifted.\nTrump has since said he is \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" with Putin over the lack of progress in agreeing a truce between Kyiv and Moscow.\nEarlier this week, Washington and Moscow went ahead with a prisoner swap. \nKsenia Karelina, a Russian-American, was sentenced to 12 years in jail in Russia for donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity when the war began in February 2022.     \nThe Los Angeles resident was freed on Thursday morning and exchanged for Arthur Petrov, a dual German-Russian citizen arrested in Cyprus in 2023. \nHe was accused of illegally exporting microelectronics to Russia for manufacturers working with the military.",

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is in \"excellent cognitive and physical health\", says his White House physician. \nIn the first annual physical of his second presidential term at a Washington DC-area hospital, Trump was also found to have scarring \"on the right ear from a gunshot wound\", after an assassination attempt last July.\n\"President Trump remains in excellent health, exhibiting robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function,\" his doctor, Captain Sean Barbabella, said in a memo. \nAt 78, Trump was the oldest president to take office in January, though his predecessor, Joe Biden, was older at 82 by the time he left.\nAs a part of Friday's nearly five-hour medical examination at the Walter Reed hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, Trump received several blood tests, a cardiac examination and ultrasounds, said his doctor, a US Navy emergency physician who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  \n\"President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,\" Dr Barbabella wrote in the memo released by the White House on Sunday. \nThe president received neurological tests on his mental status, nerves, motor and sensory function and reflexes and showed no signs of depression or anxiety, according to the memo.\nTrump was also given the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and scored 30 out of 30, said Dr Barbabella. The test is commonly used to detect cognitive decline and early signs of dementia and has tasks such as naming animals, drawing a clock and repeating words back five minutes later. \nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump said he \"got every answer right\" on the cognitive test.\n\"Overall, I felt I was in very good shape,\" Trump said. \"A good heart, a good soul, a very good soul.\" \nHe added that doctors had given him \"a little bit\" of advice on lifestyle changes to improve his health, though he did not provide details. \nDr Barbabella also said Trump had \"minor sun damage\" and a few \"benign skin lesions\". \nThe president takes several medications to control his cholesterol - Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe - as well as Aspirin for cardiac prevention and Mometasone cream for a skin condition, said the memo. \nTrump's cardiac examination showed \"no abnormalities\", wrote Dr Barbabella.\nThe examination noted the president's medical history of \"well-controlled hypercholesterolemia\", a condition which can increase a patient's risk of a heart attack. \nOther conditions noted in his medical history included a past Covid infection, rosacea, which is a skin condition often causing redness in the face, and a benign colon polyp.\nThe president weighs 224lb (101kg) and stands 6ft 2.5in tall, according to the records from Dr Barbabella. Trump has shed some pounds since February 2019, when he weighed 243lb. \nUnder the Body Mass Index calculator, he would currently be categorised within the overweight range, and not obese. \nThe memo noted that the president's \"joints and muscles have a full range of motion\", while crediting his good health to an active lifestyle, including \"frequent victories in golf events\".\nIt is the first medical report on Trump released to the public since a gunman tried to kill him at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July, grazing his ear with a bullet.\nAt the time, Trump's former White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, released a report saying his injuries from the incident were superficial.\nDuring Trump's first term in office, a White House doctor said he was in good health but needed to lose weight and exercise. \nOn the campaign trail, Trump frequently attacked his rival, Biden, over his cognitive and physical health.\nAfter a poor debate performance last year against Trump, Biden declined to commit to taking a cognitive test, which he said he had not undergone while in office.

        "article_text": "Iran and the US have concluded a first round of talks in Oman over Tehran's nuclear programme - the highest-level meeting between the two nations since 2018.\nBoth countries described the meeting as \"constructive\" and confirmed a second round of discussions will take place next week - with the US hailing the \"direct communication\" as being key to striking a possible deal.\nPresident Donald Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in 2018, and has long said he would make a \"better\" deal.\nThe talks are seen as an important first step in establishing whether a deal can be done. \nAt two-and-a-half hours, the first meeting was brief, reportedly respectful - and set the stage for a second round.\nThat was probably as good as it could get when Iranian and US officials sat down in Muscat, the capital of Oman - whose top diplomat mediated the primarily indirect negotiations.\nThey were the most significant talks since Trump pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal of 2015 during his first term in office.\nThe verdict of Iran's lead negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, was positive.\n\"In my opinion, as the first meeting, it was a constructive meeting held in a very peaceful and respectful environment, because no inappropriate language was used,\" he told Iranian state TV.\nHis diplomatic tone suggests the US team led by Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff did not reiterate some of the president's threats that Iran would face \"great danger\" if this dialogue did not succeed. He has repeatedly warned of possible military strikes.\nThis meeting ran with the delegations in separate rooms, relaying messages through Oman's foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi.\nWitkoff, who is leading the US delegation, had previously only spoken of meeting face-to-face. \nBut Araghchi and Witkoff did speak for a few minutes in the presence of Busaidi \u2013 not the direct talks US officials said would happen but what could be a small but significant opening. \nIran, mindful of pressure from hardliners at home, underlined how limited their face-to-face exchange was, with no photographs taken.\nIn a statement following the talks, the White House said the discussions \"were very positive and constructive\", noting that Witkoff had emphasised to Iran that he had instructions to resolve the adversaries' \"differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible\".\n\"These issues are very complicated, and special envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,\" the statement added. \nAraghchi had said ahead of the discussions that his country wanted a \"fair agreement\".\nAfter the talks concluded, he said discussions next week may not happen in Oman, but would still be mediated by the Middle Eastern nation. The White House said they would take place next Saturday.\n\"Neither we, nor the other party, want fruitless negotiations, discussions for discussions' sake, time wasting or talks that drag on forever,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television.\nThe most important issue at stake is what kind of deal each side would be willing to accept. \nTrump sent a letter to Iran's supreme leader via the United Arab Emirates last month, saying he wanted a deal to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and to avert possible military strikes by the US and Israel.\nIran hopes for a deal to limit, but not dismantle, its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. \nAn unnamed source in Oman told news agency Reuters that the talks would seek to de-escalate regional tensions and secure prisoner exchanges.\nTrump revealed the talks would take place during a visit by Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House on Monday. The Israeli prime minister said on Tuesday that both leaders had agreed that Iran \"will not have nuclear weapons\".\nNetanyahu has called for a \"Libya-style deal\", referring to the north African nation completely dismantling its weapons programme in an agreement reached with Western powers in 2003. That would be completely unacceptable to Iran.\nIran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.\nIranian officials have made it clear the negotiations will focus only on its nuclear programme, not its broader defence capability, such as its ballistic missile programme.\nAhead of the talks, Trump said on Friday that he wanted Iran \"to be a wonderful, great, happy country - but they can't have nuclear weapons\".\nTrump has warned that the US would use military force if a deal was not reached, and Iran has repeatedly said it will not negotiate under pressure. \nBut this process is taking place under immense pressure. \nEven as preparations were under way to arrange this first meeting, the US moved more warships and stealth bombers to the region and imposed more sanctions.\nThe US president told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday it would \"be a very bad day for Iran\" if the talks were unsuccessful.\nIran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.\nHowever, since Trump pulled out of the 2015 agreement - which expires later this year - Iran has increasingly breached restrictions imposed by the existing nuclear deal in retaliation for crippling US sanctions reinstated seven years ago, and has stockpiled enough highly-enriched uranium to make several bombs.\nUnder the terms of the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to only enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity for the next 15 years. \nIn February, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog reported that Tehran had stockpiled uranium enriched to 60% purity and could swiftly move to 90%, which would be weapons-grade.\nThe 2015 nuclear deal took nearly two years of intensive negotiations. At the start of this new effort to reach an agreement, Iran's programme is far more developed and complex, and the wider region is far more volatile.",

        "article_text": "Strolling in bright sunshine across the immaculately raked gravel of Paris's Tuileries gardens, Barbara and Rick Wilson from Dallas, Oregon, were not exactly in disguise. But earlier that morning, on their very first trip to France, Rick, 74, had taken an unusual precaution. \nBefore leaving his hotel, he'd taken a small piece of black tape and covered up the Stars and Stripes flag on the corner of his baseball cap.\n\"We're sick about it. It's horrible. Just horrible,\" said Rick, as he and his wife contemplated the sudden sense of shame and embarrassment they said they now felt, as Americans, following President Trump's abrupt moves on global trading tariffs.\nBarbara, 70, even had a Canadian lapel pin in her pocket \u2013 a gift from another tourist - which she thought might come in useful if further subterfuge proved necessary.\n\"I'm disappointed in our country. We are upset about the tariffs,\" she explained.\nA few yards away, towards the crowds gathering outside the Louvre Museum, another American couple was also trying to keep a lower profile than usual. Chris Epps, 56, an attorney from New York, had decided he would dress a little differently on today's tour.\n\"No New York Yankees hat. I left it in the hotel. People might come up to us, treat us differently. But so far, so good,\" he added.\nAs the world grapples with the implications of Donald Trump's see-sawing quest to upend the global trading system, the impacts are being felt not just on stock markets and businesses and investment funds, but in subtler ways too, and not least here in France, a country that continues to attract vast numbers of tourists from North America, and which has a centuries-old, close, and sometimes testy relationship with the United States.\nTo be clear, there are no indications that Americans are any less welcome here than before. Our interviews with a random selection of tourists were also carried out shortly before President Trump reversed some of his tariffs.\nNonetheless, the shock and anger generated in Europe by events of the past week have added fuel to perceptions of a much larger transatlantic rift \u2013 of a shifting of the tectonic plates of international relations. \nIt is early days, of course. Americans are far from united about their government's actions and much of the evidence for changing sentiments is anecdotal.\nBut there are already some discernible effects on travel, tourism, academia and other fields.\n\"It's a big drop,\" said Philippe Gloaguen, the founder of France's most prestigious travel guides, Le Guide du Routard, sitting behind a cluttered desk in Paris and noting that orders for his books about the US had fallen by 25% so far this year.\nNot that Gloaguen was complaining. Quite the opposite, in fact.\n\"I'm very proud of my customers. They are young, well-educated, and very democratic. This was the truth for Putin\u2026 and for China. We know when there's a dictatorship going on in a country,\" he said, arguing that his French readers were beginning to view America in a similar light.\n\"They don't want to spend their money in the United States,\" Gloaguen continued, framing his publication as a sort of global democratic weathervane.\nHe noted that the abrupt fall in US sales was balanced by a rise in sales of books about \"Canada and other countries.\"\nOther evidence from the travel industry is beginning to back up the idea of a growing disenchantment with the United States. The forecasting company, Oxford Economics, is already predicting an 8.9% drop in the number of French people travelling to the US this year compared with 2024.\nAnother recent analysis \u2013 of French expatriates living in the US \u2013 found that a remarkable 78% of them are now \"particularly pessimistic\" about their future in the country, while 73% of people polled within France, in March, believed the US was no longer an \"ally\".\nOver a morning coffee in a Parisian caf\u00e9, Nicolas Conquer \u2013 an enthusiastic Trump supporter and dual French-American citizen who leads the Republicans Abroad Paris branch \u2013 acknowledged \"some volatility\" because of the tariffs but argued that a \"media narrative\" was creating a false impression of strained transatlantic relations.\n\"I'm still standing my ground... reminding people that France and the US have been the oldest allies,\" Conquer said, adding that any negative reaction to Trump's America First agenda was based on a \"childish or immature\" view of international relations.\n\"Everyone knows that we have to have strong sovereignty, strong patriotism, and that\u2026 as Trump supporters go for 'America First', we would expect that\u2026 European governments would also promote UK first, Germany first, France first,\" said Conquer.\nBut concern about the Trump administration's recent actions and rhetoric \u2013 not just in relation to tariffs but also regarding Ukraine and Greenland \u2013 is widespread across France and hard to miss. Politicians, newspapers and television talk shows have all been busy dissecting the changes, often in a tone of bitter disillusionment.\nIn practical terms, the result has sometimes been to offer support to perceived victims of the Trump administration, with French scientific institutions, backed by the French government, beginning to offer places to American researchers who've lost their jobs due to cuts in government funding.\nElsewhere there are indications of nervousness about simply travelling to the US. A prestigious social studies institute in Paris recently sent its students a warning, following reports of foreigners being questioned about their political beliefs and refused entry.\n\"We urge you to be extra vigilant when travelling abroad. It is important not to travel with your usual equipment but to use a shared computer containing only data necessary for your stay and no sensitive data. During border checks, some security services may require the unlocking of digital devices to view information, including private information,\" wrote a professor at EHESS, in a group email seen by the BBC.\nRelations between Paris and Washington have survived many previous shocks \u2013 as, for instance, American taunts about \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\" following France's decision not to participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, or the more recent spat over calls to return the Statue of Liberty.\nBut France's friendship with the US has never been as unconditionally \"special\" as that claimed by, say, the British. The French may adore Hollywood cinema, country music and the allure of the American Dream, and celebrate ties that date back to America's war of independence, but they have kept some distance too - shunning what's known here as \"Le Woke-isme\" and, today more than ever, celebrating President De Gaulle's determination to build an entirely French-owned nuclear deterrent separate from both Nato and the US.\n\"The American people remain our friend, but [Trump] is no longer our ally,\" the former French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced recently.\n\"It's definitely a relationship of 'love' and not always 'like,'\" said Kerry Halferty-Hardy, the President of the American Club of Paris, citing the ambivalent lyrics of the famous Serge Gainsbourg song, \"Je t'aime - moi non plus.\"\nLooking out of her Paris apartment towards the Eiffel Tower, Halferty-Hardy argued that the shared values of liberty and the Enlightenment linking France and the US \"are not easily dislodged and certainly not on the basis of one administration,\" but she acknowledged that \"no one can ignore what they're seeing in the headlines.\"",

        "article_text": "Scientists in the high Arctic are lifting their labs into the air to avoid damage from melting permafrost.\nNy-\u00c5lesund in Norway's Arctic is the world's most northerly settlement. A team of scientists surrounded by glaciers, polars bears, walruses and arctic foxes call this hostile environment home while they're researching the Arctic's ice, ecosystems and atmosphere.\n\"The polar night is always the hardest,\" explains Marion Maturilli, a scientist studying Arctic climate dynamics with the French and German Polar Institutes, who is based at the station.\nFor more than 50 years, Ny-\u00c5lesund has housed an international community at the top of the world just 1,200km (745 miles) from the North Pole. Remnants of scientific equipment from the mission which mapped the lines of longitude which define our time zones, still stand at Ny-\u00c5lesund. More recently, Nasa used the base for its satellite lasers and measurements of the Earth's electrical field. Now, scientists from 10 countries live there to conduct their research. For almost three months at a time, they wake and go to sleep in darkness. Their experiments stretch from space to the mysteries of phytoplankton, microplastic pollution, walrus behaviour and alterations in Arctic cyclones.\nThe need to protect the unique polar archipelago resulted in the Svalbard Environmental Protection Act, which was one of the world's first international environmental protection agreements. But the impact left on this pristine landscape by the researchers is necessary, the scientists say.\nMaturilli's team records long-term series of temperature and solar radiation measurements at Ny-\u00c5lesund. Everyday for 30 years, the team at the German station used a weather balloon to raise a radiosonde \u2013 a small instrument which measures atmospheric conditions \u2013 which has to be carefully operated to prevent icing up in the clouds. The results are used to make accurate up-to-date weather forecasts but also document the long-term changes of temperature in the upper air of the region.\u00a0 These measurements depend on having precise and accurate reference points made at the station's high latitudes which give the global coverage and even our place in space.\n\"It doesn't sound spectacular but our daily measurements have produced reliable data for an international climate reference observing network,\" says Maturilli.\nBut to limit the impact of the settlement, only around 30 people are permitted live at the research station year-round.\n\"We do everything we can from planning to execution to change the Arctic as little as possible but this research is vital\", explains Iain Rudkin, the Arctic Operations Manager for the British Antarctic Survey.\nEfforts to mitigate their own environmental impacts are a high priority according to Geir Gotaas, leader of the Norwegian Polar Institute at the base.\nScientists are careful to collaborate to avoid any duplicated research. The teams on the base share data and boat rides to collect Arctic specimens and are planning to transition to electric snowmobiles \u2013 although there are challenges. \"In the field researchers typically cover long distances and bring a lot of heavy equipment, and EV snowmobiles aren't up to the task \u2013 yet,\" says Gotaas.\nAnd, while protecting the rare ecosystem is enshrined in the Svalbard Treaty, the carbon footprint must also be limited so the science itself is not derailed.\n\"It's very important to limit our carbon footprint when we are working in such a unique environment\", Maturilli says. She explains that if a car or engine snowmobile visits the atmospheric lab, the data for these periods is not usable due to the carbon increases. (Read more about why\u00a0Ny-\u00c5lesund is the town with the cleanest air in the world.)\n\"Worsened battery performance in cold conditions and any projects which involve sea or diving activities are very difficult because the logistics use up many resources,\" she adds. \"We co-ordinate within the international community of climate researchers, each doing a puzzle piece to make sure we optimise activities so there's benefits for all\".\nThe site has enabled long-term research in the high Arctic and unique collaboration between countries and disciplines. The scientists share equipment \u2013\u00a0everything from meteorologic balloons to second hand winter clothing.\nThe Korean Polar Institute's team is one such example of cross-country collaboration. The team used results from a project carried out by a German-Nordic partnership. The work led to the Korean team publishing a paper about how Arctic ecosystems operate during the dark.\nYoo Kyung Lee from the Korean Polar Institute says she also minimises her carbon footprint at the station by freeze-drying her plant samples to transport back to South Korea for further energy-intensive experiments. The frozen samples show the multi-generational changes in Svalbard's plant life. From the base, she monitors changes in the plants \u2013 creating DNA markers to distinguish populations and later sequences their genomes so she can study their adaptations to the changing climate.\nIn addition the Norwegian and Italian bases are collaborating in the Ice Memory operation, collecting cores to preserve these rich records before they disappear. The cores are sampled as twins, one being used for research and the other sent for preservation meaning that future generations of scientists can access high-quality cores to study the environmental conditions of our planet long after glaciers may have disappeared due to global warming.\nAt the busiest times for conducting research in the summer when the sun never sets, the population still remains less than 200, with food and waste strictly managed. The researchers eat the same meals as each otherin only one room to limit the container ship deliveries and the waste generated is sorted in 10 to 15 fractions \u2013\u00a0fractions is the term for waste categories such as food, cardboard, glass \u2013 and shipped to the Norwegian mainland for recycling\nThe majority of the produce comes from Norwegian wholesale suppliers and is imported from the mainland as there is no agricultural produce in Svalbard. Gotaas says they try to keep food waste at a minimum.\n\"The most important step is quite simple; only prepare the amount of food needed to feed the number of people in Ny-\u00c5lesund at any given time,\" he explains.\nLeftovers are typically served as part of lunch the following day and whatever is left of food waste is shipped to the Norwegian mainland for composting and regular waste handling.\u00a0\nWhile undertaking their projects, scientists regularly receive spot check visits when their power usage is scrutinised \u2013 with use of electronic devices limited to conserve electricity. The power station which provides electricity and hot water still runs on diesel, although heat exchangers have been installed to extract as much heat and energy as possible from the power generator exhausts. Smaller measures are also implemented, such as installing more efficient ventilation systems in the labs, switching from regular light bulbs to LED lights, having motion sensors to switch off lights automatically, and lowering of the temperature in rooms that are not being used.\nResearch instruments themselves are meticulously tracked across this remote landscape \u2013 each registered in a Geographic Information System (GIS) layer \u2013 or collection of geographic data \u2013 with every project's tools mapped and constantly updated. The general rule is that all projects should have a start and end date so that instruments no longer active are quickly collected, explains Gotaas. Because of the need to provide environmental data of the highest quality possible, Geir says it is in \"everyone's interest to keep the local carbon footprint at a minimum to avoid any disturbance to the sensitive measurements\".\nThe stations themselves are as vulnerable as the ecosystem. The buildings, which function as both living quarters and laboratories were built as early as 1910, though to the 1960s.\nImproving insulation is a step typically taken when renovating the old buildings. But since many of the oldest buildings in Ny-\u00c5lesund are protected as cultural heritage, there are limits to what changes can be made. So, the scientists focus on improving efficiency and have installed the heat exchangers for this purpose.\u00a0\nBut due to the melting permafrost, the stations are shifting and tilting with doors no longer fitting their frames, and pools of water are rotting their wooden foundations. To tackle this problem, the teams devised an engineering method to move the stations using car jacks to raise and then lower the buildings on new steel girded frames. In some cases engineers must drill 50m (164ft) deep into the bedrock and reinforce concrete pillars which have replaced the original wooden supports.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nWhen the station was first built, the permafrost was so stable that this wasn't necessary, but with the changes from global warming over the last decades causing thawing permafrost several of the old buildings have extensive damages as the structural integrity has been compromised. Geir says that inserting steel pillars into the bedrock will \"prevent damages from occurring, and reduce the need for expensive maintenance and reparations\".\u00a0\nTwo or three people can pull the entire building off its foundations, simply cut its electricity for half an hour and then reconnect it with none of the ongoing lab research compromised. With the Italian station already moved, the UK station is next in line in spring.\nSvalbard is the fastest warming place in the world, and even within the Arctic. Leaving as little trace as possible is a challenge for the whole Ny-\u00c5lesund community. Now, not only the results but the research itself is being outpaced by the climate crisis as it becomes more seasonally dependent.\nUntil recently, scientists hoping to study the sea ice in the Arctic could research at the station but the presence of sea ice can no longer be guaranteed. \"Normally now it is too warm and turbulent for the sea ice so we've had to turn down some projects otherwise the scientists could lose their funding,\" explains Rudkin.\nMore like this:\u00a0 \n\u2022 An icy plunge: Diving under sea ice for science\n\u2022 The race to study Antarctica before it melts\n\u2022 The astronauts of the underworld\nThe work that takes place on the research base informed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that the Arctic is likely to be nearly ice-free in the summer before 2050, with Arctic sea ice cover already at its lowest level since at least 1850. And if scientists cannot research this sea ice, Rudkin worries about what will be lost to science.\n\"It's incredibly sad. Over 15 years, I've seen it change too much. [The] mind-blowing scenery gets under your skin and you fall in love with it. But I have two small kids and the thought of what world I'm leaving behind for them is always on my mind,\" Rudkin says.\n\"In daily life I meet people who ask me if the Arctic is actually changing,\" says Rudkin. \"I wish they could see how much its lost so quickly.

Someone continues to leak out information and they have all year.\n\"It started last year. We thought we had nipped it in the bud but it's still consistently coming out at different times.\"\nPostecoglou said that the 'mole' is not a player or agent because the information leaked about player injuries is too specific, and claimed that he has a \"fair idea\" of who is responsible.\n\"Look, I've always said, especially with medical information, I'm really, really careful,\" he said.\n\"You try to keep the circle of information pretty tight. I don't understand why people would do it, especially if they're so-called in our camp because I don't know how it's helpful to us.\n\"Even though we're in the world of football and I know everyone thinks these things should be carte blanche in terms of information flow, I'm still very respectful in terms of medical records and how much information we actually give on certain things.\n\"Sometimes players don't want that information disclosed, it's as simple as that.  The fact that it is getting out is unacceptable. \n\"As a club, I just think, I've got enough challenges out there without adding more to ours. We'll deal with it internally. Like you deal with anything. You do the right thing and deal with it.\"\nPostecoglou added that addressing the leak is part of the cultural change he is trying to implement at the club.\n\"You'd like to think that everyone within our camp is working with us rather than against us,\" Postecoglou said.\n\"I think it's a cultural thing. I'm big on creating a culture of success and I don't think successful organisations behave in that manner.\n\"That's the bit that we're constantly, not just me, but the other people in the club are trying to change and trying to get the club to a place where there is a real strong mentality and identity of who we are and protect that.\n\"If you have people giving out sensitive information, particularly on the medical front or the tactical front, then you need to address it.\"\nSpurs travel to Wolverhampton on Sunday after a 3-1 win over bottom club Southampton last weekend ended a run of four Premier League games without victory.\nPostecoglou's side are 14th in the table with just 37 points from 31 games.\nTottenham have struggled with injuries this season\nIt's fair to say quite a few things have got under Postecoglou's skin recently.\nHere's a rundown of the main ones.\nPostecoglou appeared to cup his ear in the direction of the travelling Spurs support during the defeat to Chelsea when substitute Pape Sarr, whose introduction was booed four minutes earlier, appeared to score an equaliser. The goal was then disallowed for a foul by Sarr in the build-up.\nThe Australian boss later denied he was goading the fans and instead wanted them to get really excited.\nThis video can not be played\nSix minutes to come to a clear & obvious decision - Ange on VAR 'lottery'\nPostecoglou is perhaps the highest profile opponent of the video assistant referee (VAR) among Premier League managers.\nAfter Sarr's strike against Chelsea was ruled out following a five-minute check, he said VAR was \"killing the game\".\n\"It's not the same game it used to be,\" said Postecoglou. \"You just don't know what you're going to get. You're standing around for 12 minutes. It's killing the game. But no-one cares about that.\nThis video can not be played\nThe game will be refereed by AI soon - Postecoglou\nEarlier this month, the Spurs boss said he \"won't accept\" fans putting phones in his face because he believes it is a \"bullying\" tactic.\n\"They want their five minutes of fame,\" he added. \"For young people, [phones] are more dangerous than any other weapon in the world.\nThis video can not be played\nPutting phone in someone's face is bullying tactic - Postecoglou\nThis week Postecoglou argued everything Spurs do is seen in a negative light.\nSome fans thought Brennan Johnson, having scored twice, should have been given the chance to complete his hat-trick when he won a late penalty against Southampton last weekend.\nInstead the ball was handed to nominated penalty taker Mathys Tel, who scored to make it 3-1.\n\"The one slight against this club is that it hasn't been a winner. Well a winner's mentality in the last minute of a game is to score a goal,\" added Postecoglou.\n\"We scored a goal, and yet somehow in this ultimate universe in which everything Tottenham does is wrong, that's negative.\n\"We're in a position where even the good stuff we may do is turned into some sort of glass half full kind of rhetoric.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'Everything Tottenham does is negative' - Postecoglou\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\nGet Tottenham news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Home to three Michelin-starred restaurants and a royal gingerbread legacy, the unassuming Lancashire town of Ormskirk is fast becoming the UK's most delicious destination.\nWhen it comes to UK destinations for a gourmet weekend away, there's a new name on the lips of serious foodies. Forget the metropolitan streets of Chelsea, Mayfair or even Edinburgh. Britain's latest gastronomic hotspot is in the rural hinterlands of deepest Lancashire.\nHolidaymakers journeying to this historic county in north-west England \u2013 a key location in the English and Industrial revolutions \u2013 would have traditionally been heading for Blackpool, the classic British seaside resort whose best-known epicurean delight is Blackpool Rock, a tooth-shatteringly tough cylindrical stick of boiled sugar and glucose syrup.\u00a0\nBut, for those with more refined palates \u2013 or more delicate dental work \u2013 the tastiest rewards are to be found in Ormskirk, a bustling market town that was once a Viking settlement, and in Aughton, the small village next door.\u00a0\nIt's in this small village where Mark Birchall serves as chef patron of Moor Hall, a produce-driven restaurant within the grounds of a Grade II-listed, 16th-Century manor house. And at this year's Michelin awards, he was the only chef in Britain and Ireland to have been awarded a third Michelin star. As such, he has become one of only 10 chefs in the country (and fewer than 150 in the entire world) to hold the three-star accolade, a designation signalling that, according to the tyre company's inspectors, a restaurant is worth making a dedicated journey for.\nNo stranger to recognition, Moor Hall was voted Best Restaurant in England in the 2023 National Restaurant Awards, and also possesses a green Michelin star for the sustainable cooking practices used to create its 18-course tasting menu. Additionally, Birchall's \"neighbourhood restaurant\", The Barn (offering more casual dining at a lower price point), is a mere 30 second stroll around the lake from Moor Hall and possesses a Michelin star of its very own too.\nAs if that weren't enough, less than 10 minutes' walk away is Chef Tim Allen's restaurant s\u014d-l\u014d which has a Michelin star as well, bringing the total to a rather stellar six in the space of less than half a mile.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nSo what makes the food so special in this part of Lancashire, I ask Birchall as he forages for micro herbs and other ingredients on Moor Hall's six-acre country estate, dotted with secluded luxury garden rooms where diners can stay.\u00a0\n\"Aughton and Ormskirk have a deep-rooted connection to the land, and that plays a massive part in why the food here is so special,\" he tells me. \"The landscape, the soil, the weather \u2013 it all contributes to the quality of the produce. We're lucky to have incredibly fertile, well-draining soil, which means the fruit and vegetables \u2013 particularly leafy greens, brassicas and root veg \u2013 even the grass that feeds the livestock, are all packed with flavour.\"\nIndeed, the West Lancashire coastal plain between Preston and Southport is often referred to as \"the salad bowl of England\". According to the National Farmers Union, England's north-west region accounts for 15% of the country's food production, leading them to call it \"Britain's farming powerhouse\".\n\"The climate, too, plays its role,\" Birchall continues. \"We get just the right balance \u2013 enough rain to keep things abundant, but not so much that it drowns the land. That allows for a longer growing season, and when you combine that with generations of skilled farmers who understand how to work with the land, you get outstanding ingredients. It's that connection between produce and place that really sets the region apart.\"\nAllen agrees with Birchall, with whom he consulted before opening s\u014d-l\u014d. He has seen an influx of foodies not just from London (which is a little more than two hours away by train) but from right across the globe. \"We get people coming from America, Mexico, Norway, Finland, even Singapore,\" Allen tells me.\n\"But also, because we're located midway between Liverpool and Manchester \u2013 whose football teams (Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United) are massive \u2013 you get a lot of people travelling for the football. And many of them, it turns out, quite like eating Michelin-starred food.\"\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, these discerning fans eschew the plastic platefuls of pie and chips usually consumed on the terraces to partake of Allen's altogether more elevated offerings; dishes made with ingredients such as Louet Fessier oyster emulsion, Oscietra caviar and salt-baked celeriac (which he employs somebody to grow purely for s\u014d-l\u014d's seven-course tasting menu).\nBut this part of Lancashire offers more than the ultra-modern cordon bleu cuisine of Moor Hall and s\u014d-l\u014d; travellers in search of the area's deepest culinary roots may find them at the famous Omskirk Market. Held on Thursdays and Saturdays, it is one of the country's oldest (King Edward I granted it a Royal Charter in 1286) and is where you can sample the town's original claim to culinary fame: gingerbread.\nAs far back as 1732, recipes for the spicy baked treat were being passed down through generations of Ormskirkers. Sellers \u2013 almost exclusively women identified by their white shawls and aprons \u2013 would tout fresh gingerbread to passengers on the stagecoaches that stopped at the inns along Aughton Street on their way from Liverpool to Preston. When Ormskirk railway station opened in 1849, the women switched to targeting train passengers.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The English wine that's rivalling Champagne\n\u2022 Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022 The surprising 'lesbian capital of the UK'\n\"They would make their way along the platform, loudly knocking on all the carriage windows crying out 'Gingerbread! Who will buy my freshly baked gingerbread?',\" explains Kathryn MacDonald of the Ormskirk and District Family History Society. \"There were so many of them and they were such persuasive sellers that Ormskirk's gingerbread women became well known around the region. So when, in 1885, the Prince of Wales alighted here \u2013 he was going to a shooting party at nearby Lathom House \u2013 there was a welcome reception put on for him at the station and three of the gingerbread women were allowed to present the Prince with a gift of Ormskirk gingerbread. A few years later, when he became king (Edward VII), he'd stop the royal train at Ormskirk on his way up to Balmoral, and stock up with supplies for himself and the royal family. So, he obviously must have really liked our gingerbread!\"\nThe white-aproned women no longer ply their wares at the station, but one baker of Ormskirk gingerbread can still be found today in the town. Mr Thompson's Bakery is a family business run by Neil Thompson, his wife Janet and daughter Lilli who bake the treats in a converted shed in their back garden.\n\"Back in 2010, we revived an ancient Ormskirk gingerbread recipe but made some tweaks, such as using less salt, to suit modern tastes,\" says Lilli, who mans their stall each week at Ormskirk's famous food market.\nThe Thompsons' bakery, which has appeared in an episode of BBC TV's The Hairy Bikers Go West, is also carrying on the town's tradition of reeling in royalty with its legendary gingerbread. Janet reveals how she and Lilli were given the honour, when Princess Anne visited Ormskirk in 2022 to open a new facility at Edge Hill University, of including some of their gingerbread in a welcome hamper.\n\"Has she come back since to stock up with supplies, like her great-grandfather Edward VII did?\" I ask.\n\"Not as far I know,\" she laughs, \"but I'd like to think there's a secret stash of Ormskirk gingerbread somewhere in one of the larders of Buckingham Palace!\"\u00a0\nEach year the town hosts Ormskirk Gingerbread Festival which, this year, is scheduled to take place on 13 July. The family-friendly event allows locals and visitors to learn more about the town's culinary heritage, and some women dress up in white shawls and aprons to honour Ormskirk's most famous gingerbread hawkers.\nIt's also an opportunity to celebrate this unassuming pocket of Lancashire that has quietly become a food lover's destination in its own right \u2013 no small achievement in a country where most culinary trends tend to point south. Whether you come for the royal gingerbread, the six Michelin stars or the rich farming roots that nourish it all, Ormskirk delivers the goods\u2026 and they\u2019re anything but half-baked.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Scientists in the high Arctic are lifting their labs into the air to avoid damage from melting permafrost.\nNy-\u00c5lesund in Norway's Arctic is the world's most northerly settlement. A team of scientists surrounded by glaciers, polars bears, walruses and arctic foxes call this hostile environment home while they're researching the Arctic's ice, ecosystems and atmosphere.\n\"The polar night is always the hardest,\" explains Marion Maturilli, a scientist studying Arctic climate dynamics with the French and German Polar Institutes, who is based at the station.\nFor more than 50 years, Ny-\u00c5lesund has housed an international community at the top of the world just 1,200km (745 miles) from the North Pole. Remnants of scientific equipment from the mission which mapped the lines of longitude which define our time zones, still stand at Ny-\u00c5lesund. More recently, Nasa used the base for its satellite lasers and measurements of the Earth's electrical field. Now, scientists from 10 countries live there to conduct their research. For almost three months at a time, they wake and go to sleep in darkness. Their experiments stretch from space to the mysteries of phytoplankton, microplastic pollution, walrus behaviour and alterations in Arctic cyclones.\nThe need to protect the unique polar archipelago resulted in the Svalbard Environmental Protection Act, which was one of the world's first international environmental protection agreements. But the impact left on this pristine landscape by the researchers is necessary, the scientists say.\nMaturilli's team records long-term series of temperature and solar radiation measurements at Ny-\u00c5lesund. Everyday for 30 years, the team at the German station used a weather balloon to raise a radiosonde \u2013 a small instrument which measures atmospheric conditions \u2013 which has to be carefully operated to prevent icing up in the clouds. The results are used to make accurate up-to-date weather forecasts but also document the long-term changes of temperature in the upper air of the region.\u00a0 These measurements depend on having precise and accurate reference points made at the station's high latitudes which give the global coverage and even our place in space.\n\"It doesn't sound spectacular but our daily measurements have produced reliable data for an international climate reference observing network,\" says Maturilli.\nBut to limit the impact of the settlement, only around 30 people are permitted live at the research station year-round.\n\"We do everything we can from planning to execution to change the Arctic as little as possible but this research is vital\", explains Iain Rudkin, the Arctic Operations Manager for the British Antarctic Survey.\nEfforts to mitigate their own environmental impacts are a high priority according to Geir Gotaas, leader of the Norwegian Polar Institute at the base.\nScientists are careful to collaborate to avoid any duplicated research. The teams on the base share data and boat rides to collect Arctic specimens and are planning to transition to electric snowmobiles \u2013 although there are challenges. \"In the field researchers typically cover long distances and bring a lot of heavy equipment, and EV snowmobiles aren't up to the task \u2013 yet,\" says Gotaas.\nAnd, while protecting the rare ecosystem is enshrined in the Svalbard Treaty, the carbon footprint must also be limited so the science itself is not derailed.\n\"It's very important to limit our carbon footprint when we are working in such a unique environment\", Maturilli says. She explains that if a car or engine snowmobile visits the atmospheric lab, the data for these periods is not usable due to the carbon increases. (Read more about why\u00a0Ny-\u00c5lesund is the town with the cleanest air in the world.)\n\"Worsened battery performance in cold conditions and any projects which involve sea or diving activities are very difficult because the logistics use up many resources,\" she adds. \"We co-ordinate within the international community of climate researchers, each doing a puzzle piece to make sure we optimise activities so there's benefits for all\".\nThe site has enabled long-term research in the high Arctic and unique collaboration between countries and disciplines. The scientists share equipment \u2013\u00a0everything from meteorologic balloons to second hand winter clothing.\nThe Korean Polar Institute's team is one such example of cross-country collaboration. The team used results from a project carried out by a German-Nordic partnership. The work led to the Korean team publishing a paper about how Arctic ecosystems operate during the dark.\nYoo Kyung Lee from the Korean Polar Institute says she also minimises her carbon footprint at the station by freeze-drying her plant samples to transport back to South Korea for further energy-intensive experiments. The frozen samples show the multi-generational changes in Svalbard's plant life. From the base, she monitors changes in the plants \u2013 creating DNA markers to distinguish populations and later sequences their genomes so she can study their adaptations to the changing climate.\nIn addition the Norwegian and Italian bases are collaborating in the Ice Memory operation, collecting cores to preserve these rich records before they disappear. The cores are sampled as twins, one being used for research and the other sent for preservation meaning that future generations of scientists can access high-quality cores to study the environmental conditions of our planet long after glaciers may have disappeared due to global warming.\nAt the busiest times for conducting research in the summer when the sun never sets, the population still remains less than 200, with food and waste strictly managed. The researchers eat the same meals as each otherin only one room to limit the container ship deliveries and the waste generated is sorted in 10 to 15 fractions \u2013\u00a0fractions is the term for waste categories such as food, cardboard, glass \u2013 and shipped to the Norwegian mainland for recycling\nThe majority of the produce comes from Norwegian wholesale suppliers and is imported from the mainland as there is no agricultural produce in Svalbard. Gotaas says they try to keep food waste at a minimum.\n\"The most important step is quite simple; only prepare the amount of food needed to feed the number of people in Ny-\u00c5lesund at any given time,\" he explains.\nLeftovers are typically served as part of lunch the following day and whatever is left of food waste is shipped to the Norwegian mainland for composting and regular waste handling.\u00a0\nWhile undertaking their projects, scientists regularly receive spot check visits when their power usage is scrutinised \u2013 with use of electronic devices limited to conserve electricity. The power station which provides electricity and hot water still runs on diesel, although heat exchangers have been installed to extract as much heat and energy as possible from the power generator exhausts. Smaller measures are also implemented, such as installing more efficient ventilation systems in the labs, switching from regular light bulbs to LED lights, having motion sensors to switch off lights automatically, and lowering of the temperature in rooms that are not being used.\nResearch instruments themselves are meticulously tracked across this remote landscape \u2013 each registered in a Geographic Information System (GIS) layer \u2013 or collection of geographic data \u2013 with every project's tools mapped and constantly updated. The general rule is that all projects should have a start and end date so that instruments no longer active are quickly collected, explains Gotaas. Because of the need to provide environmental data of the highest quality possible, Geir says it is in \"everyone's interest to keep the local carbon footprint at a minimum to avoid any disturbance to the sensitive measurements\".\nThe stations themselves are as vulnerable as the ecosystem. The buildings, which function as both living quarters and laboratories were built as early as 1910, though to the 1960s.\nImproving insulation is a step typically taken when renovating the old buildings. But since many of the oldest buildings in Ny-\u00c5lesund are protected as cultural heritage, there are limits to what changes can be made. So, the scientists focus on improving efficiency and have installed the heat exchangers for this purpose.\u00a0\nBut due to the melting permafrost, the stations are shifting and tilting with doors no longer fitting their frames, and pools of water are rotting their wooden foundations. To tackle this problem, the teams devised an engineering method to move the stations using car jacks to raise and then lower the buildings on new steel girded frames. In some cases engineers must drill 50m (164ft) deep into the bedrock and reinforce concrete pillars which have replaced the original wooden supports.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nWhen the station was first built, the permafrost was so stable that this wasn't necessary, but with the changes from global warming over the last decades causing thawing permafrost several of the old buildings have extensive damages as the structural integrity has been compromised. Geir says that inserting steel pillars into the bedrock will \"prevent damages from occurring, and reduce the need for expensive maintenance and reparations\".\u00a0\nTwo or three people can pull the entire building off its foundations, simply cut its electricity for half an hour and then reconnect it with none of the ongoing lab research compromised. With the Italian station already moved, the UK station is next in line in spring.\nSvalbard is the fastest warming place in the world, and even within the Arctic. Leaving as little trace as possible is a challenge for the whole Ny-\u00c5lesund community. Now, not only the results but the research itself is being outpaced by the climate crisis as it becomes more seasonally dependent.\nUntil recently, scientists hoping to study the sea ice in the Arctic could research at the station but the presence of sea ice can no longer be guaranteed. \"Normally now it is too warm and turbulent for the sea ice so we've had to turn down some projects otherwise the scientists could lose their funding,\" explains Rudkin.\nMore like this:\u00a0 \n\u2022 An icy plunge: Diving under sea ice for science\n\u2022 The race to study Antarctica before it melts\n\u2022 The astronauts of the underworld\nThe work that takes place on the research base informed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that the Arctic is likely to be nearly ice-free in the summer before 2050, with Arctic sea ice cover already at its lowest level since at least 1850. And if scientists cannot research this sea ice, Rudkin worries about what will be lost to science.\n\"It's incredibly sad. Over 15 years, I've seen it change too much. [The] mind-blowing scenery gets under your skin and you fall in love with it. But I have two small kids and the thought of what world I'm leaving behind for them is always on my mind,\" Rudkin says.\n\"In daily life I meet people who ask me if the Arctic is actually changing,\" says Rudkin. \"I wish they could see how much its lost so quickly.

        "article_text": "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.\nIt looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.\nIt is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.\nScientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.\nThe development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.\nBut what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.\nA lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.\nFor a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.\n\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"\nChildren who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains. \n\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"\nDuring the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.\nKey to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.\n\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"\nThis skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school. \n\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"\nIn another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.\nA research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds.\n\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.\n\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"\nThe study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.\nThe Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.\nThe project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.\nOne study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.\nThanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.\nAnd the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.\nIn this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.\nEmily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.\n\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"\nHelping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.\n\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"\nHenry and Jackson finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.\n\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to. \n\"Why wouldn't you want to be part of this and maybe help future generations?\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

It depends on what Witkoff has come with.\"\nBeforehand, Witkoff had a meeting with Dmitriev at the Grand Hotel Europe in St Petersburg, where a conference was held on stainless steel and the Russian market. \nDmitriev, the 49-year-old head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, visited Washington last week and was the most senior Russian official to go to the US since the country's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nMeanwhile Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war during a visit on Friday to the site of a 4 April Russian missile attack on his home town of Kryvyi Rih. The attack killed 19 people, including nine children.\nHe also alleged that hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting with the Russian army. It comes after Ukraine said it had captured two Chinese nationals.\n\"We have information that at least several hundred Chinese nationals are fighting as part of Russia's occupation forces,\" Zelensky said.\n\"This means Russia is clearly trying to prolong the war even by using Chinese lives.\"\nZelensky laid flowers in front of photos of Herman Tripolets, nine, and seven-year-olds Arina Samodina and Radyslav Yatsko.\nHe later reiterated a call for air defence systems \"to protect lives and our cities\".\n\"We discussed this with President Trump - Ukraine is not just asking, we're ready to purchase these additional systems,\" he wrote on social media.\n\"Only powerful weapons can truly be relied upon to protect life when you have a neighbour like Russia.\"\nTrump has previously claimed he could end the Ukraine-Russia conflict \"in 24 hours\". On Friday, he declared that it would not have happened at all if he'd been in the White House in 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\n\"A war that should ld [sic] have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!,\" he wrote.\nIn February US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia for their first face-to-face talks since the invasion. Officials have also been meeting to discuss restoring full diplomatic relations.\nTrump has also had a fractious relationship with Zelensky since his second term as US president began, culminating in an angry confrontation in the Oval Office in February.\nThe US attempted to broker a limited ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, only for it to stall when the Kremlin asked for sanctions imposed after it launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour to be lifted.\nTrump has since said he is \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" with Putin over the lack of progress in agreeing a truce between Kyiv and Moscow.\nEarlier this week, Washington and Moscow went ahead with a prisoner swap. \nKsenia Karelina, a Russian-American, was sentenced to 12 years in jail in Russia for donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity when the war began in February 2022.     \nThe Los Angeles resident was freed on Thursday morning and exchanged for Arthur Petrov, a dual German-Russian citizen arrested in Cyprus in 2023. \nHe was accused of illegally exporting microelectronics to Russia for manufacturers working with the military.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nPostecoglou reacts to defeat by Wolves\nIf Ange Postecoglou is on the hunt for leaks at Tottenham Hotspur, his search should start with those running through his midfield and defence that have been left unattended to place his job in jeopardy.\nPostecoglou revealed on Friday that there was a mole inside his club filtering out classified information into the public domain.\nBut what is no secret is Spurs are a soft touch for opponents with even the slightest hint of threat.\nIt was proved again in a 4-2 defeat by Wolves at Molineux - a masterclass in every reason why Postecoglou's side have lost 17 Premier League games out of 32, more than in any other season, and why they languish down in 15th place.\nTheir afternoon was encapsulated by Djed Spence's farcical own goal, as keeper Guglielmo Vicario palmed the ball against the backtracking full-back and into the net, to give Wolves a two-goal lead in a dispiriting first half.\nPostecoglou's expression of thunder turned to one of complete disbelief when he went back to the bench to review the moment on a monitor. It was an X-rated horror show.\nIt is a flaw the Australian has simply been unable to cure, undermining all his fine attacking principles that prompted such optimism and hope in the early months of his reign.\nSince Postecoglou took over before the 2023-24 campaign, only West Ham and Sheffield United (seven each) have scored more Premier League own goals than the six by Spurs.\nAnd only the current bottom three clubs \u2013 Southampton (26), Leicester (22) and Ipswich (19) \u2013 have lost more league games than their 17 this season.\nIt is the most defeats Spurs have suffered in a league campaign since 2003-04 (19) when they finished 14th.\nThere does have to be some context applied to this defeat, though.\nPostecoglou's priorities, perfectly understandably, lie with the Europa League quarter-final second leg away to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday after a 1-1 draw in the first meeting at home.\nIt explained the six changes that saw Son Heung-min, Micky van de Ven, Pedro Porro and Destiny Udogie kept back, while Rodrigo Bentancur came on as substitute. The big bonus was the return of Dejan Kulusevski after injury for a 15-minute run-out.\nThere is also a worrying downside to that context too.\nIf there is any repeat of the carelessness and general incompetence that scarred this display, then Spurs' trophy hopes will be over for another season and so, in all probability, will be Postecoglou's spell in charge.\nWhat cannot be explained away is the slapdash manner and lack of basic organisation that allowed rejuvenated Wolves to record a fourth straight top-flight success for the first time since January 1972.\nIt started inside two minutes, when keeper Vicario's tame punch from a corner found Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri unmarked from the set-piece on the edge of the area. He accepted the invitation to score.\nThe second was another calamity, Vicario again culpable when he turned home striker Marshall Munetsi's tame header on to Spence when he could have held on, the ball rebounded back into his own goal.\nAnd even when Mathys Tel offered hope just before the hour with his second league goal in successive games, Cristian Romero flouted his status as a World Cup winner with a shocking piece of defending. The Argentina centre-back was robbed and beaten by Ait-Nouri, who crossed for Jorgen Strand Larsen to score with ease, and for a fourth successive game.\nIt went on.\nSpurs inflicted more of their own wounds after Richarlison thought he had set up a tense finale with five minutes left.\nLucas Bergvall, instrumental in Spurs' first goal, then coughed up possession too easily in an instant, leaving Matheus Cunha to race clear and score just a minute later.\nWolves edge closer to safety as Spurs suffer again\n'We've got a leak' - Spurs to 'deal with' problem in camp\nThis video can not be played\nWhy Spurs keep conceding 'ludicrous' goals - MOTD2\nThere has to be a measure of sympathy for Postecoglou, who looked a disconsolate figure as he made his way across towards those Spurs supporters who were left after the final whistle, because some of these errors were the sort for which no manager can legislate.\nPostecoglou defended his players saying: \"The goals weren't lapses or anything, they were individual errors, which is unusual for us to give goals away like that. But that's what happens and we got punished and makes it difficult for us to get an outcome.\"\nIt was a very generous interpretation from a manager who has taken so much heat himself \u2013 but the volume of these mistakes, and the regularity with which they have happened in this dismal season, point to a deeper problem.\nOn the individual errors by Romero and Bergvall, he added: \"It's not like they're doing it on purpose. Those two are pretty reliable in those situations. Today was a collection of events that were unusual and that makes it difficult to get anything out of the game.\"\nThose who sit in judgement on Postecoglou's future, and in the stands at Molineux, may beg to differ given the number of times Spurs have been similarly exposed this season.\nAnd, with his usual honesty, Postecoglou added: \"Mistakes are part of football, I'm not going to be holding anyone to account, the only person who gets held to account is me.\n\"I thought we played pretty well but conceded some pretty poor goals. Individual errors cost us. It's disappointing to lose.\"\nThe backdrop to it all was the sight of thousands of discontented Spurs fans stretched along one side of Molineux.\nThey did not aim their ire in the direction of Postecoglou, but chairman Daniel Levy, with loud chants of \"We Want Levy Out\" after only eight minutes, while holding up banners emblazoned with the message \"Time For Change\".\nThe status quo remains for now but it all comes down, as it has for some time, to the Europa League as Postecoglou's final chance to fulfil his promise of winning a trophy in his second season.\nIt may be his final chance. Full stop.\nThere is much to admire about Postecoglou and his purist footballing principles, but in reality it has all come down to events in Frankfurt this Thursday night.\nIt is now or never for Postecoglou and Spurs.\nTottenham fans expressed their discontent - especially towards chairman Daniel Levy - during the defeat at Wolverhampton Wanderers\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\nGet Tottenham news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "It was a typical Friday lunchtime in Beirut's southern suburb. Then, a single warning, posted in Arabic on X by a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), triggered panic and chaos in the densely populated area known as Dahieh.\n\"Urgent warning to those in the southern suburb of Beirut,\" it read. The post included a map of a residential area, marking a building in red and two nearby schools. The IDF identified the building as a Hezbollah facility, and ordered the immediate evacuation of the schools. \nAn air strike was imminent.\nWhat followed were scenes of sheer panic. Parents rushed towards the threatened area to collect their children from the schools, while residents fled in the opposite direction, visibly shaken and fearful.\n\"It was total chaos,\" recalls Ahmad Alama, the director of St Georges School, one of those highlighted on the map. \"We tried to contain the situation as much as we could, but it was crazy.\"\nThe area was soon cleared, and Israeli forces destroyed the marked building, which they said was a warehouse storing Hezbollah drones.\nThe strike, carried out two weeks ago, was the first on Dahieh \u2013 an area with a strong Hezbollah presence \u2013 since a ceasefire ending the war between Israel and Hezbollah took effect last November.\nIt came hours after two rockets were launched from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel. Israel said it intercepted one rocket, while the other fell short of the border.\nHezbollah, the Iran-backed militant and political group, denied involvement. Israel described the rocket fire as a ceasefire \"violation\", while the office of Lebanon's president, Joseph Aoun, condemned the Israeli strike as a \"violation of the agreement\".\n\"We thought the war had ended with the ceasefire,\" says Mr Alama, \"But unfortunately, we're still living it every day.\"\nDespite the ceasefire, Israel has continued near-daily strikes on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, saying it is acting to stop Hezbollah from rearming. The strikes have mainly occurred in southern Lebanon, but the recent bombings in Dahieh have sparked particular alarm.\nOn 1 April, a second Israeli strike hit the area \u2013 this time without warning \u2013 killing a Hezbollah commander and three other people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.\nMr Alama has been running St Georges School for 30 years. It serves around 1,000 children of all ages, boys and girls. Although religion is part of the curriculum for older pupils, he describes the school as secular.\nIt is also well-known in the community for its association with the Lebanese pop star and talent show judge, Ragheb Alama \u2013 Ahmad Alama's brother and the school's owner.\nThe recently destroyed building lies just metres from the school. It isn't the only nearby scene of devastation. Another building, opposite one of St Georges' gates, remains a massive pile of rubble \u2013 brought down by Israeli air strikes before the ceasefire.\nDuring the war, the schools were closed. They didn't have to deal with situations such as the one they faced. Now reopened, they are braced for the possibility of more bombing.\nThe school has devised evacuation plans, designating emergency meeting points in the basement and routes for pupils and staff to follow in case of any danger.\nThere are also new communication plans with parents to prevent a repeat of the chaos of last month's strike. Children are now routinely reminded of these procedures, with regular evacuation drills.\nStudents, staff, and parents alike are traumatised by what happened, Mr Alama says.\nInitially, the school considered cutting back on extracurricular activities to make up for lost learning, but they changed their minds.\n\"We decided otherwise,\" Mr Alama says. \"Pupils shouldn't pay the price for something they aren't responsible for. We've actually ended up increasing these activities \u2013 these kids need to release some of the pressure on them.\"\nNearly five months into the ceasefire, the return of Israeli air strikes to Beirut has intensified fears of a return to all-out war.\nThe ceasefire was meant to end more than 13 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which began when Hezbollah launched attacks on Israeli military positions the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe conflict escalated in September 2024, when Israel launched a devastating air campaign across Lebanon and invaded the south of the country.\nDahieh, deserted during the war, is bustling again. Shops have reopened, hookah smokers are back at crowded cafes, and the suburb seems as busy as before, with its persistently paralysing traffic.\nBut amid these signs of normality, scenes of destruction serve as a reminder of the pounding this area endured just months ago.\nSome 346 buildings in the area were destroyed and another were 145 partly damaged by Israeli air strikes, according to a municipal official. Israel said it targeted Hezbollah facilities and weapons caches.\nIn many neighbourhoods, the rubble is still being cleared. The roar of bulldozers and jackhammers drilling into piles of debris is almost constant.\nSome of the mounds of debris have Hezbollah flags planted on top of them, while large and small portraits of Hassan Nasrallah, the former Hezbollah leader killed by Israel during the war, line the roads.\nHowever, amid the customary signs of defiance, many are now expressing a deep concern not always voiced \u2013 at least in front of cameras \u2013 by residents of Dahieh.\n\"The destruction is terrifying. I see the destroyed buildings and I cry,\" says Sawsan Hariri, the headteacher of Burj High School, also in Dahieh. \nThe school, which also sits opposite a flattened building, sustained damage from nearby strikes.\n\"It's depressing. Walking on the street, driving your car - it's all just depressing.\"\nMs Hariri used to live on the top floor of the school building with her husband and daughter, but their home has been destroyed. They now rent a flat nearby.\nBefore the war, Burj High School had around 600 pupils. Now, it has barely 100.\nMany parents are reluctant to send their children back amid the scenes of destruction and the constant buzz of machinery. Others were concerned about the health risks, with thick dust still filling the air.\nAfter the ceasefire, owners of the private school made some basic repairs at their own expense.\nHezbollah, which is banned as a terrorist organisation in many countries but in Lebanon is a political and social movement as well as a paramilitary force, has given those who lost their homes $12,000 for a year's rent and has offered to cover the costs of repairs to apartments. However, schools and other institutions have not received any aid.\nThe Lebanese government has pledged to set up a reconstruction fund, which the World Bank estimates will cost $11bn nationwide. But international donors are believed to be insisting on the disarmament of Hezbollah and political reform \u2013 conditions that appear a distant prospect.\nThough the clearing of rubble is expected to be over by the end of the year, few expect large-scale rebuilding to follow anytime soon.",

        "article_text": "Well, well, well.\nIn a US customs messaging note quietly slipped out in the early hours of Saturday, a series of numbers were listed as exempt from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China.\nThe code \"8517.13.00.00\" means very little to most of the world, but in the US customs list it represents smartphones. \nThe inclusion meant the number one Chinese export to America by value last year was exempted from the import taxes, alongside other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells and memory cards.\nIn the context of the US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick just days ago announcing that part of the point of escalating tariffs on China was to bring back iPhone production to the US, this was a stunning about-turn. \nThe US has now excluded the single biggest Chinese export, and certainly the most high-profile finished good from tariffs, without publicly announcing it at first.\nIt is worth considering what would have happened in the absence of this exemption. \nThe effect of 125% tariffs on Apple's Zhengzhou manufacturing facility in eastern China would have started to show in weeks at most American Apple stores. It would have been a totemic \"sticker shock\" for the White House's tumultuous tariff push. \nAccording to Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm, as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China.\nThe tech giant's manufacturing profit margins are estimated to be between 40-60%. Typical iPhone prices might have moved closer to $2,000 (\u00a31,528) than $1,000. The other option for Apple could have been to spread the cost across all of its global prices, but would the rest of the world accept paying a Trump tariff tax?\nA very public repricing of iPhones has been avoided, but still may occur if, as the White House has said, the previously imposed 20% tariffs on China related to the powerful opioid fentanyl, remain in place.\nTim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, is a key player here. He can walk into a meeting with both US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. It is not an outlandish prediction to suggest that, if it comes, any peace in the US-China trade war could be brokered by Mr Cook. \nThat's based on his deep fundamental role in connecting the two economies. He was hand-selected by Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs for his unrivalled expertise in just-in-time supply logistics.\nThis is all moving rather quickly now. Weekend reports in the US press claim White House trade hawk Pete Navarro is being sidelined too, in favour of US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. \nNavarro was the author of the infamous equation that set so-called reciprocal tariff rates in proportion to the size of a country's trade surplus with the US, calling it \"the sum of all cheating\". \nBessent is now leading negotiations with trade partners seeking to avoid the reapplication of those rates after the 90-day pause.\nThere is a big question after 10 days of chaos. What is the incentive for other nations to offer much here? The Trump administration is clearly spooked by the bond market reaction to the president's trade plans, and questions surrounding the safe haven status of US debt for investors.\nIn trying to stave off effective interest rates on bonds rising to 5%, the US needs deals more than just those in surplus countries.\nIndeed this weekend's broad range of exemptions are in and of themselves an astonishing U-turn on the principle embodied in the notorious tariff chart held up by Trump in the Rose Garden. \nJust under a quarter of China's total exports are now exempt from the 125% tariff, according to Capital Economics. \nThe consultancy suggests there are other big winners from the exemptions, with 64% of exports to the US from Taiwan, 44% from Malaysia, and just under 30% from both Vietnam and Thailand now also exempt.\nThe 10% universal tariff is now riddled with exemptions, and the biggest carve outs are for many nations with massive trade surpluses from electronics manufacturing.\nThe new tariff equation is to give an effective discount from the universal 10% (through exemptions) to those with the biggest surpluses. For example, Taiwan has a $74bn surplus with the US, and Vietnam a $124bn surplus.\nThis is the exact opposite of the infamous Navarro calculation from last week. In 10 days we've gone from the \"looters and pillagers\" will be hit the hardest, to (apart from China) those with big surpluses getting the biggest exemptions.\nMeanwhile an ally such as the UK, which according to US figures has a $12bn deficit - i.e. the US sells more to the UK than the other way round, has a 25% tariff on cars, its biggest goods exports, with number two, medicines, in line for similar charges.\nThe White House has gone from clearly suggesting there would be no negotiation on the baseline 10% tariffs to offering exemptions to the very products causing the deficit the entire policy was supposed to solve.\nThis is a lot more than a \"row back\". Some have called it the \"Art of the Repeal\". The 4D chess has been replaced by someone playing one dimensional checkers, but unable to tell the difference between opposing pieces.\nThe US is now negotiating with the bond markets, and itself. The rest of the world will just see how this plays out now.",

        "article_text": "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.\nIt looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.\nIt is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.\nScientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.\nThe development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.\nBut what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.\nA lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.\nFor a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.\n\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"\nChildren who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains. \n\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"\nDuring the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.\nKey to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.\n\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"\nThis skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school. \n\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"\nIn another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.\nA research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds.\n\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.\n\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"\nThe study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.\nThe Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.\nThe project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.\nOne study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.\nThanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.\nAnd the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.\nIn this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.\nEmily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.\n\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"\nHelping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.\n\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"\nHenry and Jaxon finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.\n\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to. \n\"Why wouldn't you want to be part of this and maybe help future generations?\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

        "article_text": "Mohamed Salah was given immense ovations both before the game and when he came off for Liverpool in the second half\nWhile any player's worth to a football team has to be measured in more than statistics, Mohamed Salah's goal and assist numbers show exactly why he is worth pretty much any amount of money a week for Liverpool.\nWith his assist for Luis Diaz to open the scoring against West Ham on Sunday, Salah has now been directly involved in 45 Premier League goals this season - netting 27 and providing another 18.\nThis is a new record for a player in a 38-game season, surpassing Thierry Henry from 2002-03 and Erling Haaland's total two years ago. Salah is now 15 goal involvements clear of any other player in Europe's top five leagues in 2024-25.\nSunday also showed how important Alisson and Virgil van Dijk are as Liverpool close in on the league title - but without Salah, there most likely would be no title at all.\nWith their second league title of the Premier League era seemingly sewn up weeks ago, the latter part of Liverpool's season has been largely focused on three key players out of contract in the summer.\nWhile Trent Alexander-Arnold seems Real Madrid-bound and Van Dijk is yet to formally sign a new deal, the future of Salah was secured this week to the joy of Liverpool fans.\nHis performance on Sunday illustrated just why Liverpool were so keen to persuade him to turn down the millions of Saudi Arabia and stay on Merseyside, and just why the fans were so thrilled he did so.\n\"Mo Salah, Mo Salah, running down the wing,\" was the chant for much of the game while, when his name was announced in the pre-match line-up, it got one of the biggest cheers of the afternoon.\nAnd in the 18th minute, Salah responded with a beautifully played pass with the outside of his left boot, which was cleverly left by Diogo Jota to allow Diaz to slot home.\nThis video can not be played\nHow Liverpool mixed it up to take step closer to title\nIt was a record-breaking assist for Salah, one which helped move Liverpool to within six points of a Premier League title - and their first won in front of fans following their triumph in the Covid-affected season in 2020.\n\"When we won it we won it in lockdown,\" Salah told Sky Sports after the game. \"So let's go for it and win it.\"\nSunday was a game of three phases for Liverpool. The first half was the Salah phase, in which his brilliance put the Reds ahead and could have led to a goal or two more.\nThe second phase was that of Alisson, whose brilliance between the sticks ultimately earned Liverpool the win more than any other factor.

        "article_text": "Buying or renting a home has become unaffordable for the average Australian, driven by a perfect storm of astronomical house prices, relentless rental increases and a lack of social housing.\nWith less than a month until the federal election, housing remains among the top issues for voters, and the country's two major parties \u2013 the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Coalition - have both pledged to tackle the crisis in a range of ways.\nAustralians are already struggling under cost-of-living pressures and bracing for the effects of Donald Trump's global tariff war. And it remains to be seen whether either party will sway voters with their promise of restoring the Australian dream.\nSimply put, Australia has not been building enough homes to meet the demands of its rapidly growing population, creating a scarcity that makes any available home more expensive to buy or rent.\nCompounding the issue are Australia's restrictive planning laws, which prevent homes being built where most people want to live, such as in major cities.\nRed tape means that popular metropolitan areas like Melbourne and Sydney are far less dense than comparably sized cities around the world.\nThe steady decline of public housing and ballooning waitlists have made matters worse, tipping people into homelessness or overcrowded living conditions.\nClimate change has also made many areas increasingly unliveable, with natural disasters such as bushfires and severe storms destroying large swathes of properties.\nMeanwhile, decades of government policies have commercialised property ownership. So the ideal of owning a home, once seen as a right in Australia, has turned into an investment opportunity.\nIn short: it depends where you live.\nSydney is currently the second least affordable city in the world to buy a property, according to a 2023 Demographia International Housing Affordability survey.\nThe latest data from property analytics company CoreLogic shows the average Sydney home costs almost A$1.2m (\u00a3570,294, $742,026).\nAcross the nation's capital cities, the combined average house price sits at just over A$900,000.\nHouse prices in Australia overall have also jumped 39.1% in the last five years - and wages have failed to keep up.\nIt now takes the average prospective homeowner around 10 years to save the 20% deposit usually required to buy an average home, according to a 2024 State of the Housing System report.\nThe rental market has provided little relief, with rents increasing by 36.1% nationally since the onset of Covid - an equivalent rise of A$171 per week.\nSydney topped the charts with a median weekly rent of A$773, according to CoreLogic's latest rental review. Perth came in second with average rents at A$695 per week, followed by Canberra at A$667 per week.\nImmigration and foreign property purchases are often cited as causes for Australia's housing crisis. But experts say that they are not significant contributors  statistically.\nMany people who move to Australia are temporary migrants, such as international students who live in dedicated student accommodation rather than entering the housing market, according to Michael Fotheringham, head of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute.\n\"The impact [of migrants] on the housing market is not as profound as some commentators have suggested,\" Mr Fotheringham tells the BBC.\nForeign purchases of homes, meanwhile, is \"a very small issue\" with not much meaningful impact on housing strain, says Brendan Coates, from the Grattan Institute public policy think tank.\nThe latest data released by the Australian Taxation Office supports this, with homes purchased by foreign buyers in 2022-23 representing less than one percent of all sales.\n\"It's already very difficult for foreigners to purchase homes under existing foreign investment rules. They are subject to a wide range of taxes, particularly in some states,\" Mr Coates explains.\nLabor and the Coalition have both promised to invest in building more homes \u2013 with Labor offering 1.2 million by 2029, and the Coalition vowing to unlock 500,000.\nLabor announced a A$33bn housing investment plan in their latest budget, which pledges to help first-time homebuyers purchase properties with smaller deposits through shared-equity loans.\nThey have also promised to create more social housing and subsidies to help low-to-moderate-income earners own and rent more affordably.\nCentral to the Coalition's housing affordability policy is cutting migration, reducing the number of international students and implementing a two-year ban on foreign investment in existing properties.\nAdditionally, they have promised a A$5bn boost to infrastructure to support local councils by paying for water, power and sewerage at housing development sites.\nThe Greens' policies, meanwhile, have focused on alleviating pressures on renters by calling for national rent freezes and caps.\nThey have also said that in the event of a minority government, they will be pushing to reform tax incentives for investors.\nIn short, experts say that while both Labor and the Coalition's policies are steps in the right direction, neither are sufficient to solve the housing problem.\n\"A combination of both parties' platforms would be better than what we're seeing from either side individually,\" Mr Coates tells the BBC.\nA 2025 State of the Land report by the Urban Development Institute of Australia says the federal government will fail to meet its target of 1.2 million new homes by 2029 \u2013 falling short by almost 400,000.\nThe Coalition's focus on reducing immigration, meanwhile, will only make housing marginally cheaper while making Australia poorer in the long-term, according to Mr Coates.\nThe cuts to migration will mean fewer skilled migrants, he explains, and the loss of revenue from those migrants will result in higher taxes for Australians.\nDecades of underinvestment in social housing also means demand in that area is massively outstripping supply - which at 4% of housing stock is significantly lower than many other countries, according to Mr Fotheringham.\nThere's also concern about grants for first homebuyers, which drive prices up further.\nWhile commending the fact that these issues are finally being treated seriously, Mr Fotheringham believes it will take years to drag Australia out of a housing crisis that has been building for decades.\n\"We've been sleepwalking into this as a nation for quite some time,\" he says. \"[Now] the nation is paying attention, the political class is paying attention.\"\nAdditional reporting and video by Kellie Highet in Sydney",

So the ideal of owning a home, once seen as a right in Australia, has turned into an investment opportunity.How much do I need to buy or rent a home in Australia?In short: it depends where you live.Sydney is currently the second least affordable city in the world to buy a property, according to a 2023 Demographia International Housing Affordability survey.The latest data from property analytics company CoreLogic shows the average Sydney home costs almost A$1.2m (\u00a3570,294, $742,026).Across the nation's capital cities, the combined average house price sits at just over A$900,000.House prices in Australia overall have also jumped 39.1% in the last five years - and wages have failed to keep up.It now takes the average prospective homeowner around 10 years to save the 20% deposit usually required to buy an average home, according to a 2024 State of the Housing System report.Getty ImagesRents have jumped across Australia's major cities, with Sydney, Perth and Canberra among the most expensiveThe rental market has provided little relief, with rents increasing by 36.1% nationally since the onset of Covid - an equivalent rise of A$171 per week.Sydney topped the charts with a median weekly rent of A$773, according to CoreLogic's latest rental review. \"The impact [of migrants] on the housing market is not as profound as some commentators have suggested,\" Mr Fotheringham tells the BBC.Foreign purchases of homes, meanwhile, is \"a very small issue\" with not much meaningful impact on housing strain, says Brendan Coates, from the Grattan Institute public policy think tank.The year the Australian Dream diedHow Australia is becoming more unliveableThe latest data released by the Australian Taxation Office supports this, with homes purchased by foreign buyers in 2022-23 representing less than one percent of all sales. Australia's looming election brings housing crisis into focus1 day agoShareSaveYang TianBBC NewsReporting fromSydneyShareSave\"Pretty diabolical\" - The BBC speaks to people in Sydney about Australia's housing crisisBuying or renting a home has become unaffordable for the average Australian, driven by a perfect storm of astronomical house prices, relentless rental increases and a lack of social housing.With less than a month until the federal election, housing remains among the top issues for voters, and the country's two major parties \u2013 the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Coalition - have both pledged to tackle the crisis in a range of ways.Australians are already struggling under cost-of-living pressures and bracing for the effects of Donald Trump's global tariff war.",

That doesn't benefit anybody\".\nWilliam Matthews, of north Wales holiday home letting agency Oyster Holiday Cottages, said he understood the principle of the change, but he believed the 182-day threshold was too high.\n\"The difficult part is we're in agreement that the houses need to be filled year round. We've always pushed those shoulder months as much as we can to bring customers to north Wales the whole time, putting money into the economy.\n\"However, there is a tipping point, and it has potentially gone a bit too far.\"\nWhile he worries about the potential effects on investment in north Wales, Mr Matthews remains optimistic about the future of the industry.\n\"People are always going to come on holiday here. I don't think we'll ever lose that,\" he said.\nThe Welsh government said: \"We recognise the importance of tourism to the Welsh economy, but must balance that with the needs of our communities, as everybody has a right to a decent, affordable home to buy or to rent that allows them to live and work locally.\n\"Our package of measures to tackle the impact of second homes and holiday lets helps ensure owners are making a fair contribution in areas where they have homes or run businesses.\"",

        "article_text": "The UK government is taking control of Chinese-owned British Steel after emergency legislation was rushed through Parliament in a single day.\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told MPs the government's likely next step would be to nationalise the Scunthorpe plant, which employs 2,700 people.\nBut he said he was forced to seek emergency powers to prevent owners Jingye shutting down its two blast furnaces, which would have ended primary steel production in the UK.\nMPs and peers were called back from their Easter holidays to debate the legislation in an extremely rare Saturday sitting of both houses of Parliament. It has now received Royal Assent after being passed by the Commons and Lords.\nThe BBC understands UK government officials are at the Scunthorpe site ready to take control of operations.\nAfter the legislation was given royal assent, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Today, my government has stepped in to save British steel. \n\"We are acting to protect the jobs of thousands of workers, and all options are on the table to secure the future of the industry.\"\nHe said steel made in Britain \"will be the backbone as we get Britain building once more,\" adding: \"Our industry is the pride of our history \u2013 and I want it to be our future, too.\"\nSpeaking to steelworkers earlier on Saturday at a village hall near Scunthorpe, Sir Keir said: \"You are the people who have kept this going.\"\nIt came as several hundred people, including steelworkers and their families, took part in a march and a rally at Scunthorpe United's Glanford Park stadium, chanting \"we want our steel back\".\nBritish Steel worker Rob Barroclough told the BBC: \"Our family, like many others, is built around the steelworks. Who knows... my boys might end up working there one day, if it can be saved.\"\nHe added: \"We're hoping for the best but planning for the worst.\"\nMeanwhile, it has emerged that police were called to the steel works this morning after a suspected breach of the peace.\nJingye officials have been on-site regularly in recent days, and it's thought that relations between them and the workers have become increasingly tense.\nSources told BBC News that when Jingye executives arrived at the plant this morning, the automatic number plate recognition scanners didn't allow them through the site barriers.\nHumberside Police said officers conducted checks and spoke to individuals but that there were no concerns raised and no arrests were made.\nThe legislation going through Parliament was not resisted by opposition parties \u2013 but the Conservatives said the government should have acted sooner and made \"a total pig's breakfast of this whole arrangement\".\nThe new law hands Reynolds sweeping powers to control management and workers at the plant to ensure production continues, including entering it by force, if necessary, to secure assets.\nBut Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.\nThe government remains hopeful it can secure private investment to save the loss-making plant, but ministers concede there are currently no companies willing to make an offer.\nIn the Commons, Reynolds acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\".\nHe said the government would \"pay the fair market rate\" to shareholders in the event of nationalisation but added: \"In this case the market value is effectively zero.\"\nKeeping a loss-making plant open could come at a high cost to taxpayers.\nBut Reynolds insisted it was in the \"national interest\" to retain the ability to make steel from scratch and he believed the company had a future, particularly as the government was boosting infrastructure spending.\n\"Steel is fundamental to Britain's industrial strength, to our security, and to our identity as a primary global power\", he told MPs. \nHe said he had been forced to take over the running of the plant because Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2020, had rejected the government's offers to buy raw materials to keep the blast furnaces running.\n\"Despite our offer to Jingye being substantial, they wanted much more. Frankly, an excessive amount. We did however remain committed to negotiation.\n\"But over the last few days, it became clear that the intention of Jingye was to refuse to purchase sufficient raw material to keep the blast furnaces running, in fact, their intention was to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders.\n\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel.\"\nReform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice urged the government to \"show your cojones\" and go further by fully nationalising British Steel \"this weekend\".\nSeveral Conservative MPs also spoke in favour of nationalisation. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said recalling Parliament had been \"absolutely the right thing to do\" but urged ministers to use the \"unprecedented legislation judiciously\".\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, now an independent MP, urged the government to nationalise all steelmaking in the UK.\nGreen MP Ellie Chowns said steel is integral to the \"green industrial transformation\" - including making wind turbines, trains and tracks - and nationalisation would give the UK the control it needs to renew the industry.\nThe government came under fire for acting to save the Scunthorpe plant but not taking the same action when the Tata Steel works in Port Talbot was threatened with closure.\nPlaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Robert said it was a \"bitter day for the people of Port Talbot\", as she urged the government to change the legislation to take control of what is left of the steelworks there.\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn asked why the legislation only applies to England, when a Scottish oil refinery is facing closure.\n\"Why is this not being extended to Scotland? Why is Grangemouth not being included?\" he asked Reynolds, adding the UK government was \"not interested in Scotland\".\nReynolds said Grangemouth was \"not comparable\" with the situation at Scunthorpe, which he said was \"unique\".\n\"The question for all members is whether we as a country want to continue to possess a steel industry, do we want to make the construction steel and rail we need here in the UK, or do we want to be dependent on overseas imports?\" he told MPs.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nWomen's FA Cup highlights: Chelsea 2-1 Liverpool\nIt was another game, another win for Chelsea as their quadruple hopes stayed intact.\nBut it was also a familiar story for Sonia Bompastor\u2019s side as they had to come from behind to beat Liverpool and reach the FA Cup final. \nIt was the eighth game since January in which the Blues had to produce a comeback or find a late winner to keep their campaign on track.\nAcademy product Aggie Beever-Jones scored a 94th-minute header as Chelsea narrowly avoided extra time in their latest rollercoaster victory.\n\"Ruthless is the only way to describe this Chelsea team,\" former Chelsea midfielder Fara Williams told BBC Sport. \"They have a crazy winning mentality.\n\"They didn't win pretty today - it looked ugly at times.\"\nDespite Chelsea being far from their free-flowing, brilliant best and being pushed all the way by Liverpool, the outcome never really felt in doubt.\nThere is a growing belief both in the Chelsea group and in the wider media that they always have what it takes to win.\n\"We said collectively a goal was going to come - and it did,\" ex-Chelsea defender Anita Asante added.\nChelsea have only lost one game in all competitions under Sonia Bompastor\nBoss Bompastor challenged her players to show the \"best version\" of themselves as they returned from an international break having dropped points in a 2-2 draw with West Ham in their previous game.\nThe stats from Saturday\u2019s victory were heavily in the Blues' favour, with 60% possession and 24 shots. However, only four of those were on target, despite an astonishing 54 touches in Liverpool\u2019s penalty area.\nWhile Bompastor did not get the version of her players that she hoped for, she said she could not have asked any more of them.\n\"They fought really hard and gave everything they had in the legs,\" the Frenchwoman said.\n\"Sometimes we could have played a little bit better, but they brought all the energy on the pitch and that is what I expect.\n\"Sometimes as players you try so hard that you make mistakes and that's fine - they are human.\n\"I will always support them when they make mistakes because I know they have the right mentality.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBeever-Jones wins it for Chelsea\nBeever-Jones had an international break to remember as she scored her first England goal in the Nations League over Belgium.\nThe 21-year-old is Chelsea's top scorer this season with 11 goals in all competitions and was the Blues' bright spark - particularly in the second half - in the bid to return to Wembley.\nBeever-Jones had the best of the Blues' second-half chances and her frustration was clearly growing with each missed opportunity, but her persistence paid off and she peeled off in ecstasy as she celebrated what proved to be the winning goal.\n\"It's been a whirlwind,\" Beever-Jones told BBC Sport. \"I'm in shock a little bit still.\n\"It's the Chelsea mentality - never giving up - and I'm delighted I got on the scoresheet and helped my team.\"\nWith Sam Kerr and Lauren James sidelined, it was apt that the academy product stepped up to send her side to Wembley, where Beever-Jones has never played.\n\"The last week has been really good for her,\" Bompastor said.\n\"Aggie is a really young, talented player. She makes a big impact for the team creating opportunities but also scoring goals.\n\"This goal will bring more confidence to her and the team. Aggie has the right mindset.\"\nWith the score 1-1, Liverpool captain Taylor Hinds hit the woodwork in the 90th minute as Chelsea's quadruple dreams almost slipped through their fingertips again.\nThe Reds provided a tough test but ultimately caved to Chelsea's pressure as their winning mentality shone through.\nBlues midfielder Erin Cuthbert told BBC Sport that reaching Wembley is \"where the club want to be\" as they look to add to their silverware this season.\nHaving won the League Cup, Chelsea sit six points clear at the top of the Women's Super League and have a Champions League semi-final against holders Barcelona coming up.\nWhile Barca will punish Chelsea in ways Liverpool perhaps could not, Bompastor said her side are at the stage of the season where results are more important than performances and they head to Catalonia full of confidence.\n\"In this part of the season, that's the most important and decisive moment in the season. You need to win the games, no matter the performance,\" Bompastor said.\n\"Sometimes when you don't perform the way you want to, but you win the game -that's the most important.\n\"We are going to play the biggest team in Europe.

        "article_text": "Viewers have been \"shattered\" by Eulogy, an emotional new episode in the seventh season of Charlie Brooker's series, starring Paul Giamatti.\nSince 2011, Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones' dystopian anthology series, Black Mirror, has presented 34 stories about the dark side of technology: how computer systems and digital gadgets might distort, warp and even end life for humans.\nThere have been the shocking, twist-filled episodes \u2013 a prime minister is forced to have intercourse with a pig on live TV to release a kidnapped princess (National Anthem); a woman chased by bounty hunters on a sadistic reality TV show is revealed to be a child-killer (White Bear) \u2013 but every so often, there's a tale that transcends the \"what if technology went bad?\" theme and instead manages to capture the multi-layered nuances of human existence.\nThis gentle, more emotional side to Black Mirror has previously emerged in several fan-favourite episodes, such as San Junipero, released in 2016: a love story between two young women set in the 80s, that is later revealed to be a simulated reality where the dead and the still living can co-exist together online. Be Right Back (2013) was prescient in its explorations of AI, and how the experience of grief might lead someone to create a computer-generated version of their loved one. And themes of infidelity and sexual obsession viewed through an embedded memory \"grain\" were explored with devastating results in 2011's The Entire History of You, written by Succession's Jesse Armstrong.\nAnd while there's always a place for slightly silly, catastrophising predictions of the endgame of computers and the internet (Plaything and Common People in season seven are decent new examples of this), Black Mirror excels when the technology is just one part of the story, not the point of the story. The newest series appears to recognise this, and is perhaps the most heartfelt and emotional of the entire catalogue. With three of the seven episodes centred around a love story, however, it's episode five, Eulogy, which has been the standout, quietly devastating viewers on the day of its release.\u00a0\n\"Eulogy broke me in a very particular way I wasn't expecting,\" one viewer wrote on\u00a0X, while another said\u00a0it was \"an utterly heartbreaking yet fantastic piece of television\u2026 just beautifully painful\". Another user\u00a0added: \"Truly incredible from every standard possible. I've been crying for the last 5 minutes\u2026 Heartbreak can't even scrape the surface of what this has made me feel.\" Another was still in recovery from the viewing: \"It ha[d] me sobbing. And I mean heavy, fat tears.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe critics agree. Stylist's Kayleigh Dray\u00a0said, \"Eulogy shattered me, and I can't stop thinking about it,\" while Ben Rosenstock\u00a0from Vulture\u00a0added that it was the \"most heartbreaking episode of the season\".\u00a0GameRant's Aayush Sharma called it \"the best episode of Black Mirror Season 7... Paul Giamatti is EXCEPTIONAL\", and Jake Kleinman from\u00a0Huffington Post said: \"It might even be the best Black Mirror episode in years.\"\nEulogy \u2013 co-written by Brooker and Ella Road \u2013 indeed features a captivating performance from Giamatti as Phillip, an older man who is asked if he'll use a digital chip to access his memories to create a eulogy for the funeral of Carol Royce, a girlfriend who broke his heart in his 20s.\nThe technology set-up is just one impressive strand of this episode as the special effects featured allow Phillip to \"jump\" into old photos, exploring the recreated scene around him. But it's the world-building outside of these merged live-action and CGI scenes that is truly affecting. Piece by piece, the story of Phillip and Carol's relationship and break-up is revealed through his old images and mementos \u2013 how it was fractured by him having an affair; the subsequent dramatic proposal he orchestrates in London; and his humiliation when she walks out on him, never to be heard from again.\u00a0\nHis resulting emotional turmoil is palpable, especially in Giamatti's powerful monologues. But with the help of an avatar \"guide\" (played by Patsy Ferran) in the Eulogy digital chip, Phillip discovers information that gives him a brand new perspective that could have changed the course of his and Carol's lives \u2013 but which, tragically, has come too late.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why The White Lotus season three divided fans and critics\n\u2022 The must-see star-studded takedown of modern Hollywood\n\u2022 The Instagram wellness guru who faked cancer \nBrooker told Vulture that Eulogy is meant to be a companion piece to Be Right Back and The Entire History of You, and examines the blinding, subjective nature of hindsight: \"We were talking about memory and photography, and how an individual's take on memory might deceive them in terms of who they feel is the villain in their life.\" He added to Rolling Stone: \"It's somebody using technology to revisit the past and come out with a slightly different perspective and put some ghosts to rest.\"\u00a0\nBrooker also revealed that the loss of his own father \u2013 and having to read the eulogy at his funeral \u2013 had made the subject even more poignant for him. Eulogy, like much of the anthology, plays with the idea of nostalgia. For Phillip, however, this nostalgia has curdled; any good memories he might have had of Carol have been mentally and physically destroyed by him,\u00a0leaving him quietly seething with regret and bitterness for almost 30 years.\nAs is almost customary for Black Mirror characters \u2013 and in life itself, perhaps \u2013 there is no neat, happy ending in Eulogy, but Phillip is given a bittersweet moment of cathartic acceptance, which is what is really resonating with viewers. As Giamatti told Rolling Stone on reading the script for Eulogy: \"I was really moved by it at the end, which doesn't always happen to me.\" Even the most cynical of Black Mirror fans would have to agree that this might be the most heartfelt episode yet.\u00a0\u00a0\nBlack Mirror season seven is available on Netflix.\u00a0\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.\nMany of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.\nThe effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.\nAnd if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.\nBen Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.\n\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.\nThough others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.\nAnd there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.\nWhile a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.\n\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.\nThe US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.\nIt says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.\nAlong with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.\nIndia and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.\nAs tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.\nReuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.\nAmid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.\nThe BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet. \nTrump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.\nHowever, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly. \nThis, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.\nApple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.\nBut Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.\n\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.\nApple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.  \nSome analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them. \n\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.\nBut he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.\n\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"\nSome estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers. \nFollowing Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.  \nThey estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.\nWhile some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.\nThere's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen. \nThis hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.\nThe BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.\nAnthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.\n\"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said.\nBruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad.\n\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.\nWe will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.\nBut if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.\nCCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.\nThe iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.\nThe other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.\n\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood. \nAdditional reporting by Paul Sargeant, Tom Finn and Pratiksha Ghildial.",

        "article_text": "Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into an attack on three prison officers by Hashem Abedi, one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing.\nThe Prison Service said three officers have been treated in hospital after Saturday's attack at HMP Frankland in County Durham, as the Prison Officers' Association (POA) said the life-threatening injuries included burns and stab wounds. \nAbedi, 28, who was jailed for life for helping his brother carry out the 2017 suicide bombing, threw hot cooking oil over the officers and used \"home made weapons\" to stab them, the POA said.\nThe Ministry of Justice said there will be a full review.\nThe female officer was discharged by 16:00 BST on Saturday. Her two male colleagues suffered \"severe stab wounds\" and remain in hospital where their conditions have \"stabilised\", Mark Fairhurst, national chairman of the POA, said on Sunday. \nSaturday's attack took place in a separation centre at HMP Frankland where Abedi has been a long-term inmate. \nThat centre, which holds fewer than 10 inmates, is used to house prisoners regarded as the most dangerous and extremist.\nFairhurst said separation centres are \"very well resourced - for obvious reasons\" but \"to allow that type of prisoner to access the kitchen and use utensils that can be used as weapons... [that policy] needs to be removed immediately\". \n\"We are demanding that with immediate effect they restrict and remove cooking facilities from separation centres,\" he said.\n\"We are worried about the knock-on effects and copycat incidents.\" \nThe separation model was introduced in 2017 with the aim of separating and controlling prisoners who present a risk that cannot be managed in a mainstream location, according to the Ministry of Justice. \nFairhurst, who is due to visit the prison on Monday, told the BBC he was \"appalled\" that offenders in these locations were being \"allowed the same privileges as normal location prisoners\". \n\"A separation centre is there for a reason,\" he said. \"All we need to do with those types of prisoners is give them their basic entitlements.\n\"Separation centres should be for control and containment because these people are not going to change their ideologies and they are intent on inflicting harm on everyone they come into contact with.\"\nLater on Sunday, Fairhurst added the POA will be writing to Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood to request an urgent meeting around the levels of protection for staff working with these category of prisoners. \nHe said the organisation had been asking for \"several years\" for the government and employers to provide stab-proof vests for frontline staff.\n\"Now is the time to issue staff with the appropriate levels of protection they need when dealing with prisoners who pose such a risk and such a threat,\" he said. \nA prison officer at HMP Frankland told BBC News \"staff are shaken by what's happened\". \n\"You can't help asking yourself why you do this job when something like this happens.\" \nAbedi's brother Salman Abedi carried out the Manchester Arena suicide bombing which killed 22 people.\nHashem Abedi was found guilty in 2020 of 22 counts of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion likely to endanger life and sentenced to a minimum term of at least 55 years before he could be considered for parole. \nThe sentence was a record for a determinate prison term. \nIn 2022, Abedi, along with two others, was found guilty of a previous attack on two prison officers at Belmarsh Prison in south-east London. \nA sentence of three years and 10 months for this attack was added to his previous minimum term. \nCounter-terrorism policing (CTP)'s Cdr Dom Murphy said: \"Given the nature of the incident [on Saturday], it has been agreed that CTP North East will lead the investigation, supported by Durham Constabulary.\n\"This is an ongoing investigation which is in its early stages, and we are working hard to establish the facts. Therefore, we are unable to comment further at this time.\"\nFollowing the incident, former prison governor John Podmore told the BBC this incident was a \"catastrophic security failure\" as he underlined this unit holds the \"most violent and dangerous\" offenders. \nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"I am appalled by the attack of three brave officers at HMP Frankland today. My thoughts are with them and their families.\n\"The police are now investigating. I will be pushing for the strongest possible punishment. Violence against our staff will never be tolerated.\"\nShadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick called the attack \"extremely concerning\".\n\"There are serious concerns about the prison leadership's ability to contain the threat from Islamist extremist inmates,\" he said.\n\"This deeply serious security failure must be a turning point,\" he added as he referenced a previous social media post of his titled \"Britain's prisons are being overrun by Islamist gangs\".\nA spokesperson for the Prison Service said violence in prisons \"will not be tolerated\".\n\"We will always push for the strongest punishment for attacks on our hardworking staff,\" they said. \nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice said on Sunday their thoughts are with the two officers who remain in hospital.\n\"There will be a full review into how this attack was able to happen, alongside the separate police inquiry,\" the spokesperson added.\n\"The government will do whatever it takes to keep our hardworking staff safe.\"\nAdditional reporting by Cachella Smith and Lucy Clarke-Billings",

which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.\nBut Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.\n\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.\nApple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.  \nSome analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them. \n\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.\nBut he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.\n\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"\nSome estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers. \nFollowing Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.  \nThey estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.\nWhile some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.\nThere's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen. \nThis hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.\nThe BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.\nAnthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.\n\"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said.\nBruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad.\n\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.\nWe will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.\nBut if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.\nCCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.\nThe iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.\nThe other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.\n\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood. \nAdditional reporting by Paul Sargeant, Tom Finn and Pratiksha Ghildial.",

        "article_text": "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.\nThe agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.\nThe deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London \u2013 but it eventually passed on Friday.\nSmall island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\".\nShipping accounts for around 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.\nBut the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.\nThe agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting. \nIt will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.\nAlthough the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.\nThe vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.\nAlthough they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.\nThere have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships. \nThe most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.\n\"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment. \n\"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said.\nIn comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.\nFigures vary depending on the fuel type but the World Economic Forum estimates that these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce. \n\"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam.\nSome island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped. \n\"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5\u00b0C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.\nTheir disappointment was shared by environmental groups.\n\"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.\nIt is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.\nBut China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal. \nJesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.\n\"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said.\nFahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.\n\"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said.\nAny money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries. \nIt is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken. \nAlthough the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. \nBut industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations. \nThe US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.\nNow the committee have agreed the measure, it is expected to be formally adopted in October.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

The first half was the Salah phase, in which his brilliance put the Reds ahead and could have led to a goal or two more.\nThe second phase was that of Alisson, whose brilliance between the sticks ultimately earned Liverpool the win more than any other factor. He missed the defeat at Fulham with concussion, and conclusively proved his importance here.\nAnd the final, shortest but most dramatic phase belonged to Van Dijk.

        "article_text": "Organised crime gangs are behind a sharp rise in scams linked to fraudulent QR codes, experts say.\nThe national fraud reporting centre Action Fraud received 1,386 reports of people being targeted last year, compared with 100 in 2019.\nContactless payment hotspots - like parking meters and restaurant menus - are common targets of criminals who stick their own QR codes on signage.\nKatherine Hart, lead officer at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said: \"We've seen huge amounts lost this way. People have seen their life savings gone and that money is going to finance criminals.\"\nShe said quishing was significantly under-reported and presented a \"huge challenge\" to authorities globally.\n\nFraudulent and misleading codes have also been spotted on parcels, in emails and on television.\nPeople who scan them using mobile phones and other electronic devices are directed to websites controlled by the scammers and tricked into handing over data such as bank details.\nMs Hart said some of those placing the codes were likely to be at the bottom of a hierarchy of organised criminals and may not be aware of the implications of their actions.\nAction Fraud statistics obtained by the BBC's Shared Data Unit suggest a rapid growth in this kind of scam, with recorded incidents more than doubling in the UK between 2023 and 2024.\nOver the past five years, Action Fraud received almost 3,000 reports in total, with a fifth of those linked to the Metropolitan Police force area.\nMilton Haworth used his mobile phone to scan a QR code at a council-run car park in Castleford, West Yorkshire.\nIt directed him to download an unauthorised app, from which he agreed a 90p fee to verify bank details.\nBut instead of paying to park, he found himself signed up to a subscription service with a \u00a339 yearly fee and no refunds offered.\n\"I'd assumed I'd paid for my parking but realised it was a scam when I noticed the next day that \u00a339 had gone out of my account,\" he said.\n\"The sign said to use the code to park and I hadn't ever heard of QR codes being used as a scam.\"\nMr Haworth blames the spike in cases on authorities \"not taking this seriously enough\".\nHe said: \"Nobody seems to care, there doesn't seem to be anyone trying to find these people.\n\"It's incumbent on the authorities to go after them but I don't think they do because it's small amounts taken, not multimillions.\n\"But if it's \u00a339 a month, what if there's a million people being duped?\"\nMs Hart said victims often lost small amounts initially as those responsible gathered the data they needed to launch a \"secondary scam\".\n\"You might lose \u00a32.99 and a lot of people won't report that and don't realise they've passed on their information to a criminal organisation,\" Ms Hart said.\n\"Days or weeks later, they get a call telling them they've been the victim of a fraud and they can pinpoint a day, because they already have all of the information you shared with them earlier.\n\"They convince you using very coercive tactics that they're from your bank, police or Trading Standards and they want to take everything you've got.\"\nExperts including the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre say it is vital that people \"stay vigilant to cyber criminals\".\nKirsty Blackman, Scottish National Party MP for Aberdeen North, spoke to the BBC after removing fake QR codes from parking machines in the city.\nShe said tackling the problem was \"genuinely difficult\", adding: \"Organised criminals are there to make money in whatever way they can and I think they'll scam people whatever we do. It's about trying to whack the moles as they pop up.\"\nShe said the more victims filed reports with Action Fraud, the better police could take action.\n\"QR codes can be really useful,\" she said. \"My kids' school sends them out regularly to share information, for example. That's why it's difficult for people to tell the difference between a legitimate code and a fake one.\n\"When you're scanning a code to pay for something, that's when you really need to stop and think.\"\nJoe Hall's girlfriend inadvertently scanned a fraudulent QR code when trying to pay for parking in Luton before Christmas.\nThe couple now refuse to use QR codes after \u00a3400 was taken from her bank account the next day.\nMr Hall said: \"I drove back to the car park and found the code she scanned was a sticker. They print them so everything's the same font and colours as the signage and it blends in.\n\"If you know what you're looking for, you might spot it but a lot of the time, you might not even think about it.\n\"It's so easy for them to make money out of it - there were four others behind my girlfriend doing the same thing as she did.\n\"She got her money back but that's not always the case. They could easily just empty your bank account.\"\nNational Car Parks, which runs 800 car parking sites across the UK, is considering removing QR codes from its signage.\nIt said a \"rigorous process\" had already been introduced to prevent its QR codes being compromised, with signs inspected and codes checked every day.\nA spokesman said two of its car parks had been targeted by scammers and the business was \"reviewing options\" to reduce the impact of fraudulent QR codes.\nHe said: \"This could include removing a QR code from our signage that directs customers to a payment page, and instead emphasising the use of our website.\n\"We understand the value of QR codes and will still look to use them where we can safely.\"\nDet Supt Gary Miles, head of the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, encouraged users to \"stay alert\" to signs of fraudulent codes.\n\"You should stop and check before scanning one,\" he said. \"If you're in person, check for signs it has been tampered with, or online, look out for phishing emails or rogue social media posts with QR codes.\n\"We know that QR codes can be used in all aspects of life, online and in-person, however this doesn't stop fraudsters finding new ways to target members of the public.\"\nMore about this story\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nRead more about the Local News Partnerships here.",

I'll just try to play good football like I've always done.\"\nThe problem is De Bruyne has not played good football this season.\nIt is one of the reasons Guardiola and outgoing technical director Txiki Begiristain decided not to offer the 33-year-old a contract extension when his current deal expires on 30 June.\nIt is still not clear whether De Bruyne will remain at the club for their Club World Cup campaign, which might not finish until mid-July.\n'Move to MLS or Saudi most likely if De Bruyne doesn't retire'\nThe questions around De Bruyne's Man City departure\nKevin de Bruyne has won 16 trophies during his 10 years at Manchester City\nSadly for Crystal Palace, he chose them to remind us all what he is capable of.\nWith City trailing 2-0 and seemingly heading for defeat, De Bruyne led the recovery mission.\nThe Belgian hit the woodwork before pulling a goal back by deceiving goalkeeper Dean Henderson with a free-kick that went in off a post.\nThe history books will show Ilkay Gundogan was credited with the assist for Omar Marmoush's equaliser. But it was De Bruyne's nod-back Marmoush buried after Gundogan had failed to get proper contact on it.\nDe Bruyne definitely teed up Mateo Kovacic for City's crucial third goal at the start of the second half, calmly rolling a pass perfectly into the Croat's path on the edge of the area when many, less aware, colleagues might have panicked and made the wrong decision.\nHe should really have had another assist when he set up Marmoush but Henderson repelled the Egyptian's close-range finish.\n\"It is the kind of performance Kevin has done in many games, for many years,\" said Guardiola.\n\"Unfortunately, for 18 months he could not do it because of the injuries and surgery, but [today] he played fantastic. The gratitude I have for him is huge.\"\nEven Palace manager Oliver Glasner appreciated De Bruyne's talent. He just wishes he had not been on the receiving end.\n\"Every manager loves to see a player like him with intelligence,\" he said. \"He moves and always finds the space - it is how he scores and creates chances.\"\nDe Bruyne's goal was his first in the Premier League since early December\nDe Bruyne is not a shouter or screamer. He is not in the Roy Keane or Patrick Vieira mould of captains, the type who drove their team on through a mixture of intense demands and doing their own job really well.\nHe is not athletic in the way Steven Gerrard used to be.\nBut he can create something from nothing through a combination of awareness and execution. He is a player who sees opportunities others do not.\nThen he is capable of delivery. It takes him to a level of the game removed from virtually anyone else.\nIt is why, while the debate is futile and there can be no 'winner', he has to be in the conversation about the best player of a Premier League era which is now in its fourth decade.\nAnd it is why, when asked if James McAtee, who scored on his first Premier League start, might fill De Bruyne's boots next season, Guardiola's response was dripping with incredulity.\n\"No-one can do what Kevin has done,\" said the City boss.\n\"Kevin has a unique talent, a vision in the pass. When the players are up front and Kevin has the ball, they know they can run because the ball will be delivered.\n\"He is not a vocal leader. But in nine years, he has been there every three days.\"\nSoon, he will not be there. De Bruyne's future is unknown.\nThere have been plenty of rumours around Major League Soccer (MLS) and, most recently, Inter Miami, although in some ways the idea of De Bruyne in the same team as Lionel Messi seems a waste.\nDe Bruyne has no reason to play second fiddle to anyone, not even one of the handful of players widely accepted as being the best ever.\nHe will reach his conclusion in his own quiet way. De Bruyne certainly thinks he still has something to offer.\n\"It's been a hard year but I've been pain-free for the last six weeks and that makes a massive difference,\" he told TNT Sports.\n\"I don't know how I'm going to feel [in my last game] - I've been here so long, my kids were born in Manchester and lived their whole life here.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nWomen's FA Cup highlights: Manchester City 0-2 Manchester United\nWith their Women's Champions League qualification hopes hanging by a thread, an interim manager in charge and no silverware - what has gone wrong for Manchester City this season?\nIt is not the way they pictured things after pushing Chelsea all the way in a pulsating Women's Super League title race last year, coming second only on goal difference. \nBut when the full-time whistle went at the Joie Stadium on Sunday, ending City's last chance of winning a trophy this season, they had to stand and watch as rivals Manchester United celebrated reaching a third successive FA Cup final with their 2-0 win. \nAn injury crisis, managerial upheaval and disappointing performances in the biggest moments have all contributed to what has been a season to forget.\nAny team without Vivianne Miedema, Khadija Shaw, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood would drop their level. \nCity's extensive injury list, which includes those key players, has severely impacted their campaign and thrust their lack of squad depth into question.\nJill Roord, Aoba Fujino, Rebecca Knaak, Laura Coombs, Naomi Layzell and keeper Ayaka Yamashita have also missed a significant number of games this season as City currently sit fourth in the WSL, seven points adrift of Manchester United in the final Champions League spot with just four games left.\nThey had only four outfield players on the bench in the second leg of their Women's Champions League quarter-final defeat by Chelsea, where the Blues overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit, and have ended the season with academy graduates Gracie Prior and Lily Murphy starting almost every game.\nInterim manager Nick Cushing admitted the injury crisis \"100% needs to be examined\" in the summer - but it will not help his side now.\n\"With so many injuries, they can't be all bad luck and they can't all be down to bad practise,\" he said.\n\"We have to look at everything. We have to look at why we're sitting fourth in the league, why we've not won a trophy and why we've not got our best players [through injury]. \n\"The review process will be covering everything. I think we should be competing in every competition right until the end.\"\nWhile City's misfortune is clear, they also failed to act, unlike their rivals.\nWhen Chelsea superstar Sam Kerr suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury last year, they broke the then-British record to bring in Colombian forward Mayra Ramirez. \nThe WSL leaders then splashed the cash in a world-record deal for defender Naomi Girma in January after losing Kadeisha Buchanan, also to an ACL injury.\nMeanwhile, despite a growing injury list, City only signed four players in January, one of which was 20-year-old midfielder Aemu Oyama and allowed England international Chloe Kelly to join Arsenal on loan.\n\"Some of those [injured] players would walk into any team in the WSL,\" said former City and England captain Steph Houghton on BBC Two. \n\"If you take away Shaw, Miedema and Greenwood, that is a spine of experienced players and also good quality players.\n\"You've got a 20-year-old in Gracie Prior that has come through the academy and has played a lot of games recently. Should she be in the team? \n\"This is not down to individual performances but ultimately we are trying to build a squad to go and win trophies. \n\"We are missing some key players. That has proved the difference. Without a doubt the strength in depth isn't there and that is something we need to address.\"\nHolders Man Utd beat Man City to reach FA Cup final\nMan City's Miedema may miss rest of season with injury\nChelsea show 'ruthless' mentality as quadruple bid still on\nIt has been a tough few months for City and underpinning it all has been a managerial change. \nHaving already fallen away in the WSL title race, the dramatic circumstances surrounding forward Kelly's exit in January raised eyebrows.\nThat led to divisions within the fanbase over former manager Gareth Taylor - but it was City's underwhelming performances that ultimately proved to be his downfall.\nThe decision to sack Taylor was a bold one as it came just days before a crucial two-week period in which City would face Chelsea four times in three competitions.\n\"Unfortunately we have just not had the rub of the green this season,\" Houghton added. \"The managerial change adds another factor to the performances we have seen over the past few months.\n\"Ultimately, this is a big learning curve and it's how we get better as a club going forward.\"\nInterim manager Cushing was brought back to the club to try to instil some stability and there were positive signs, but ultimately he did not have enough time to turn things around.\nAt the end of an intense four-game battle with Sonia Bompastor's side, City had lost the Women's League Cup final, dropped further points in the WSL and were knocked out of Europe despite taking a two-goal first-leg advantage.\nIt was a damaging period which left very little to play for and City's wounds were cut deeper when bitter rivals United punished them in the FA Cup.\nAsked if the semi-final defeat by United had effectively ended City's season, interim manager Cushing said: \"In the sense of trophies, it is over. We can't win a trophy.\n\"Mathematically we can still get third place [in the WSL]. I said after the game, 'we have to win out now'. We have to win every game.\n\"If we do that and Manchester United slip up in a difficult run of games, then we have a chance [of qualifying for Europe]. \n\"We have to play better and win at Old Trafford [in the WSL on 4 May]. We have to embrace the pressure and responsibility of that and fight through it.\"\nBut what is most disappointing, is that City haven't competed with their rivals in the big games this season in the way many had expected. \nTheir sole victory in those matches against Chelsea ultimately proved to be insignificant as it was in the first leg of their Champions League defeat.\nThey were poor against Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final, having already been beaten 4-2 by their rivals in the WSL at Etihad Stadium in January.\nAnd at the Joie Stadium in February, with a top-three WSL spot up for grabs, City conceded twice within eight minutes in a 4-3 loss to Arsenal.\nThey have 11 points fewer in the league than they had at this stage last season, having scored nine goals less and conceding 11 more. \n\"No matter how it looks, you should compete. I would take any 11 players in the world and think we can win in a certain way,\" said Cushing after Sunday's loss.\n\"That might be our problem, that we don't have the toughness and desire to attack the game, however it looks. \n\"There is a lot of conversation nowadays about the beautiful side of the game - tactics and systems. But you have to win tackles, win duels and compete. \n\"We have to go away and figure that out so whoever we play and however we play, we can compete at the level our football club expects.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "summary": "City's extensive injury list, which includes those key players, has severely impacted their campaign and thrust their lack of squad depth into question.Jill Roord, Aoba Fujino, Rebecca Knaak, Laura Coombs, Naomi Layzell and keeper Ayaka Yamashita have also missed a significant number of games this season as City currently sit fourth in the WSL, seven points adrift of Manchester United in the final Champions League spot with just four games left.They had only four outfield players on the bench in the second leg of their Women's Champions League quarter-final defeat by Chelsea, where the Blues overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit, and have ended the season with academy graduates Gracie Prior and Lily Murphy starting almost every game.Interim manager Nick Cushing admitted the injury crisis \"100% needs to be examined\" in the summer - but it will not help his side now. I said after the game, 'we have to win out now'. We have to win every game. I would take any 11 players in the world and think we can win in a certain way,\" said Cushing after Sunday's loss. But when the full-time whistle went at the Joie Stadium on Sunday, ending City's last chance of winning a trophy this season, they had to stand and watch as rivals Manchester United celebrated reaching a third successive FA Cup final with their 2-0 win.",

        "article_text": "The head of the US military base in Greenland has been fired after she reportedly sent an email distancing herself from Vice-President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark.\nThe US military's Space Operations Command said Col Susannah Meyers had been removed from her role at Pituffik Space Base due to a \"loss of confidence in her ability to lead\".\nLast month, Vance said Denmark had \"not done a good job\" for Greenlanders and had not spent enough on security while visiting the Danish territory.\nThe alleged email, released by a military news site, told staff Vance's comments were \"not reflective\" of the base. A Pentagon spokesman cited the article, saying \"undermining\" US leadership was not tolerated.\nFollowing Vance's trip, on 31 March, Col Meyers is reported to have written: \"I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by Vice-President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base.\"\nMilitary.com - which published the email - said the contents had been confirmed as accurate to them by the US Space Force.\nAppearing to confirm this was the reason for her firing, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell linked to the Military.com article in a post on X, writing: \"Actions [that] undermine the chain of command or to subvert President [Donald] Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense.\"\nThe Space Force's statement announcing Col Meyers' removal on Thursday said that Col Shawn Lee was replacing her. \nIt added: \"Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties.\" \nCol Meyers had assumed command of the Arctic station in July last year. Col Lee was previously a squadron commander at the Clear Space Force Station in Alaska.\nDuring his whirlwind trip, Vance had also reiterated Trump's desire to annex Greenland for security reasons. \nSince the US delegation's visit, both Greenland and Denmark have shown a united front, opposing a US annexation of the autonomous Danish territory.\nEarlier this month, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's official visit saw her stand side-by-side with her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen and his predecessor, Mute Egede.\nSpeaking to reporters, Frederiksen directly addressed Trump, telling him: \"You can't annex other countries.\"\nShe added that Denmark was fortifying its military presence in the Arctic, and offered closer collaboration with the US in defending the region.\nThe US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland as a strategically important territory. It has had a military presence on the island since occupying it following the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany during World War Two.\n\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, previously told the BBC.\n\"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\"\nGreenland, the world's largest island, has been under Danish control for around 300 years. \nPolls show that the vast majority of Greenlanders want to gain independence from Denmark - but do not wish to become part of the US.\nGreenland has had the right to call an independence referendum since 2009, though in recent years some political parties have begun pushing harder for one to take place.",
