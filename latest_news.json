Despite reporting it to Roblox, she never received a response.\nShe welcomed the announcements as a \"start\", but said Roblox \"needs to do better\".\nShe added: \"What's missing is proper authentication of users. How does the company know that users are who they say they are - how will perpetrators be traced when grooming keeps happening?\"\nRoblox highlighted to BBC News its community standards, which have a zero-tolerance policy for the exploitation of minors.\nAmir from Leeds told the BBC last month that his 15-year-old son is \"addicted\" to Roblox, and can use the site for up to 14 hours a day.\nHe has welcomed the changes announced today for younger users, but wants the platform itself to do more and target the availability of inappropriate games for children.\nKathryn Foley's nine-year-old daughter Helene is a regular on Roblox. Kathryn ensures her daughter avoids games where other players would talk to her, or friend requests.\nMs Foley told BBC News: \"I know I will absolutely be using the game blocking feature, and to see how long my daughter spends on particular games - and also if she is playing games I didn't know she played.\"\nKirsty Solman has spoken with the BBC about how Roblox has helped her 13-year-old son Kyle - who has ADHD, autism and severe anxiety - with social interactions.\nShe said: \"These all sound fantastic especially the experience blocking, as a concern is the type of games our children are accessing.\"\nRoblox has also announced the expansion of its voice safety AI (artificial intelligence) model, to help moderate voice chats between players, with the feature now available in seven additional languages.\nMeanwhile, Roblox has outlined changes to its advertising model, with players to be paid in-game currency to watch adverts on the platform.",

        "article_text": "The meeting between motivational speaker Brad Burton and Sam Wall lasted less than a minute. She posed for a picture with him after attending one of his workshops and later left a glowing video testimonial.\nIt was unremarkable, Mr Burton says. \"Just one of the thousands of people I must have met over the years.\"\nTwo years later, she started attacking him online.\nIn hundreds of posts, Wall described him as manipulative, a psychopath and a sociopathic abuser. Day after day, she accused him of making death threats, breaking her windows and killing her cat - all false allegations.\n\"She put it on social media across all platforms. She was painting a picture that, somewhere along the way, I had done all these things and I was trying to cover it up,\" Mr Burton tells BBC Panorama.\n\"How do you prove a negative? That I had not poisoned the cat? Social media and the way it works, it's guilty until proven innocent.\"\nWall, 55, a social media consultant, pleaded guilty to charges of stalking and sending false messages at Manchester Magistrates' Court last November.\nHer sentencing was delayed for a second time last week, but the judge told her to expect a prison sentence.\nWall's legal team said a psychiatric report shows she has a chronic delusional mental health illness.\nHer conviction was in relation to two victims - Mr Burton and businesswoman Naomi Timperley - who were targeted with abusive messages over the past four years.\n\"It's just been hideous, really hideous, and I don't know why it happened,\" Mrs Timperley tells us. \"I'm still really anxious, sometimes I get really sad.\"\nBBC Panorama has spoken to other victims who say they were stalked by Wall over a period of more than 10 years.\nSome had never met Wall, while others only knew her as a passing acquaintance.\nAt the time Wall targeted Mr Burton, he was running a network supporting hundreds of small businesses across the UK.\nMany of her abusive posts were detailed - one was 20,000 words long. Some were shared on LinkedIn, where she had 30,000 followers - the very platform Mr Burton relied on to promote his work.\nWhile the pandemic hit him hard, he says she helped to sink his business.\nWall also falsely claimed that Mr Burton had in fact been harassing her for 10 years - and that he had been arrested and jailed.\nMr Burton posted pictures of himself online to prove he was not in prison. Wall responded by claiming his psychopathic twin was taking the photos and appearing at events to cover up the fact he had been locked up.\nHis friend Alan Price knew Wall was lying about the 10-year claim, because he had introduced them at the workshop two years earlier.\n\"She's telling everybody that Brad Burton is in jail, but I was actually out in Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset having a curry with him,\" he says.\nIn an attempt to stop her, Mr Burton went to a solicitor who advised him to send a cease and desist letter. Wall then responded by publishing the letter online and saying he could sue her - but she had no money.\nMrs Timperley had only met Wall in passing - she followed her on Twitter and they were connected on LinkedIn. She was also targeted with hundreds of messages - accused of criminal damage, destroying Wall's business and of joining up with others to carry out so-called gang stalking. \nWall also falsely claimed Mrs Timperley had been arrested for harassment.\n\"I've been personally attacked on Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook and accused of really vile things,\" she tells us.\nWall continued her online attacks even after she had been charged with stalking.\nManchester-based entrepreneur Justine Wright was targeted over a decade. She had employed Wall for a couple of months and, when Wall left, the online stalking began.\nMs Wright is a marketing consultant and Wall repeatedly targeted her clients - major companies - with false claims. Justine had never met Brad, but Wall accused her of conspiring with him to poison her cat.\nPeople might be surprised by the number of victims and that Wall did not disguise her identity, says Rory Innes, chief executive of the Cyber Helpline, a charity that helps victims of online crime. \nBut he says this is common.\n\"It's a horrendous case and she will be causing harm to lots of people and changing their lives. But this is happening to hundreds of thousands of people every year.\"\nPanorama has spoken to other victims who do not want to be identified. One says he was stalked for more than a decade, during which time Wall sent thousands of texts, plus 10,000-word emails to his friends and business contacts.\nWall would also turn up at his work pretending to be his wife, he says, and accusing him of domestic abuse.\nAll of the victims complained to the social media companies about Wall's posts, but they have not been taken down.\nSocial media lawyer Paul Tweed tells Panorama he was not surprised the companies had failed to help.\n\"They decide what should be taken down, they decide when it should be taken down and how it should be taken down. And they will say, when you ask them, that they comply with the law,\" he says.\nLinkedIn says it can't comment on individual users, but it does not allow bullying or harassment and it will take action against anything that violates its policies. Instagram, Facebook and X did not respond to Panorama's request for comment.\nNone of the companies have taken down Wall's abusive messages, even though Panorama told them about Wall's conviction two months ago.\nLast week, she posted another abusive message about Mr Burton.\nThe charity Cyber Helpline has estimated that 600,000 people report online stalking to the police every year. Another charity, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, says fewer than 2% of stalking and harassment complaints end with a conviction.\nA major review by policing bodies last year found a lack of understanding of online stalking and evidence of the police failing to take it seriously.\nThe advice to victims of online stalking is basic - don't engage, keep records and report it to the police. But the people Panorama spoke to did that, and the abuse continued.\nMr Burton and and Mrs Timperley were unhappy with the response they got from Greater Manchester Police (GMP).\nOutcomes for victims are really poor, Roy Innes from the Cyber Helpline says.\n\"So few of these cases actually end up with an investigation,\" he says. \"And when an investigation does happen, the technology element can mean it takes years to get to the point where the evidence is being looked at.\"\nA spokesperson for GMP says delays in the wider criminal justice system affected Wall's case and the force achieved positive outcomes for more than 3,000 victims of this type of crime last year.\nWe approached Wall for comment, but she did not respond.\nMeanwhile, Mr Burton says he forgives her. \"I hope she gets the help that she needs and she finds peace in her own life,\" he says.",

Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply. But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history.\"\nThe films will be released \"in proximity\" to each other in April 2028.\nThe director explained: \"I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didn't feel right.\"\nPaul Mescal, 29, shot to fame in the BBC's Normal People in 2020. He went on to star in acclaimed films Aftersun, for which he was Oscar-nominated, and All of Us Strangers,  and he played the lead in the Gladiator sequel. As well as portraying Sir Paul McCartney, the Irish star is about to be seen as another British creative genius, William Shakespeare, in the film adaptation of award-winning novel Hamnet.\nHarris Dickinson has become a star thanks to Maleficent, The King's Man, Triangle of Sadness and Where the Crawdads Sing, before playing Kidman's love interest in Babygirl. The 28-year-old Brit also received a Bafta TV Award nomination for A Murder at the End of the World, and is among the bookmakers' favourites to be the next James Bond.\nBarry Keoghan bears perhaps the closest resemblance to his Beatle - drummer Ringo. The Irish actor is the oldest of the acting quartet at 32, and is one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, having been nominated for an Oscar for The Banshees of Inisherin before leading the cast of cult hit Saltburn.\nJoseph Quinn played Eddie Munson in the fourth season of Netflix's Stranger Things, was in A Quiet Place: Day One, and appeared alongside Mescal in Gladiator II. Before appearing as guitarist Harrison, the 31-year-old Londoner will be seen as Johnny Storm/Human Torch in The Fantastic Four: First Steps and two Avengers films.\nAlthough several previous movies like Backbeat, Nowhere Boy and I Wanna Hold Your Hand have depicted The Beatles, this is the first time that all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.\nSir Sam called the films the \"first bingeable theatrical experience\", adding: \"Frankly, we need big cinematic events to get people out of the house.\"\nOn stage, Dickinson, Mescal, Keoghan and Quinn recited from the band's song Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: \"It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill, you're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us.\"\nThey then gave a Beatles-style synchronised bow.\nFormed in 1960, the original band transformed youth culture and changed the course of musical history.\nRestlessly imaginative and experimental, they had an uncanny ability to communicate sophisticated musical ideas to a mass audience, on albums including Revolver, Sgt Pepper's and The White Album. \nDespite splitting in 1970, the quartet remain the biggest-selling band of all time.\nOnly two members survive. John Lennon was murdered in 1980, while Harrison died of cancer in 2001.\nIn 2023, the surviving members released what was described as the Beatles' \"final\" song, Now And Then.\nBased on one of Lennon's old demo tapes, and featuring an archive recording of Harrison's guitar work, it went to number one and was nominated for awards at the Brits and the Grammys.\nThis is by no means the first film project to explore the lives of The Beatles - Iain Softley's Backbeat, released in 1994, dramatised their early career in Hamburg's clubs, where they cut their musical teeth.\nSam Taylor-Johnson's Nowhere Boy in 2009 starred her future husband Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Lennon and Thomas Brodie-Sangster as McCartney. It delved into Lennon's early years and family relationships, and documented him meeting McCartney and Harrison and the band's origins.\nMartin Scorsese made a factual film in 2011 called George Harrison: Living in the Material World, which included contributions from the surviving band members plus archive material.\nIn 2021, Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson restored more than 50 hours of outtakes from 1970 Beatles documentary Let It Be for Get Back, a three-part film. The epic Disney+ movie, which was nearly seven hours long, shed new light on the relationship between McCartney and Lennon before the band split in 1970.",

        "article_text": "Warning: This article contains details and images that some readers may find distressing\nDriving into Mandalay, the massive scale of the destruction from last Friday's earthquake revealed itself bit by bit.\nIn nearly every street we turned into, especially in the northern and central parts of the city, at least one building had completely collapsed, reduced to a pile of rubble. Some streets had multiple structures which had come down.\nAlmost every building we saw had cracks running through at least one of its walls, unsafe to step into. At the main city hospital they're having to treat patients outdoors.\nMyanmar's military government has said it's not allowing foreign journalists into the country after the quake, so we went in undercover. We had to operate carefully, because the country is riddled with informers and secret police who spy on their own people for the ruling military junta.\nWhat we witnessed was a people who had very little help coming their way in the face of this massive disaster.\n\"I have hope that he's alive, even if it's a small chance,\" said Nan Sin Hein, 41, who's been waiting on the street opposite a collapsed five-storey building, day and night for five days. \nHer 21 year-old-son Sai Han Pha was a construction worker, renovating the interiors of the building, which used to be a hotel and was being turned into an office space.\n\"If they can rescue him today, there's a chance he'll survive,\" she says.\nWhen the 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck, the bottom of the building sank into the ground, its top lurching at an angle over the street, looking like it could tip over at any minute.\nSai Han Pha and four other workers were trapped inside.\nWhen we visited, rescue efforts had not even begun at the building and there was no sign they would start soon. There just isn't enough help available on the ground - and the reason for that is the political situation in the country.\nEven before the earthquake Myanmar was in turmoil - locked in a civil war that has displaced an estimated 3.5 million people. Its military has continued operations against armed insurgent groups despite the disaster.\nThis means that security forces are too stretched to put their full might behind relief and rescue operations. Except in some key locations, we didn't see them in large numbers in Mandalay.\nThe military junta has put out a rare appeal for international aid, but its uneasy relations with many foreign countries, including the UK and the US, has meant that while these countries have pledged aid, help in the form of manpower on the ground is currently only from countries like India, China and Russia, among a few others.\nAnd so far those rescue efforts appear to be focused on structures where masses of people are feared trapped \u2013 the high-rise Sky Villa condominium complex which was home to hundreds of people, and U Hla Thein Buddhist academy where scores of monks were taking an examination when the earthquake struck.\nNeeraj Singh, who is leading the Indian disaster response team working at the Buddhist academy, said the structure had collapsed like a \"pancake\" - one layer on top of another.\n\"It's the most difficult collapse pattern and the chances of finding survivors are very low. But we are still hopeful and trying our best,\" he told the BBC.\nWorking under the sweltering sun, in nearly 40C, rescuers use metal drills and cutters to break the concrete slabs into smaller pieces. It's slow and extremely demanding work. When a crane lifts up the concrete pieces, the stench of decaying bodies, already quite strong, becomes overwhelming.\nThe rescuers spot four to five bodies, but it still takes a couple of hours to pull the first one out.\nSitting on mats under a makeshift tent in the compound of the academy are families of the students. Their faces are weary and despondent. As soon as they hear a body has been recovered, they crowd around the ambulance it is placed in.\nOthers gather around a rescuer who shows them a photo of the body on his mobile phone.\nAgonising moments pass as the families try to see if the dead man is a loved one.\nBut the body is so disfigured, the task is impossible. It is sent to a morgue where forensic tests will have to be conducted to confirm the identity.\nAmong the families is the father of 29-year-old U Thuzana. He has no hope that his son survived. \"Knowing my son ended up like this, I'm inconsolable, I'm filled with grief,\" U Hla Aung said, his face crumpling into a sob.\nMany of Mandalay's historical sites have also suffered significant damage, including the Mandalay Palace and the Maha Muni Pagoda, but we could not get in to see the extent of the damage.\nAccess to everything - collapse sites, victims and their families - was not easy because of the oppressive environment created by the military junta, with people often fearful of speaking to journalists.\nClose to the pagoda, we saw Buddhist funeral rituals being held on the street outside a destroyed house. It was the home of U Hla Aung Khaing and his wife Daw Mamarhtay, both in their sixties.\n\"I lived with them but was out when the earthquake struck. That's why I survived. Both my parents are gone in a single moment,\" their son told us.\nTheir bodies were extricated not by trained rescuers, but by locals who used rudimentary equipment. It took two days to pull out the couple, who were found with their arms around each other.\nMyanmar's military government says 2,886 people have died so far, but so many collapse sites have still not even been reached by the authorities, that that count is unlikely to be accurate. We may never find out what the real death toll of the earthquake was.\nParks and open spaces in Mandalay have turned into makeshift camps, as have the banks of the moat that runs around the palace. All over the city we saw people laying out mats and mattresses outside their homes as evening approached, preferring to sleep outdoors.\nMandalay is a city living in terror, and with good reason. Nearly every night since Friday there have been big aftershocks. We woke up to an aftershock of magnitude 5 in the middle of the night.\nBut tens of thousands are sleeping outdoors because they have no home to return to.\n\"I don't know what to think anymore. My heart still trembles when I think of that moment when the earthquake struck,\" said Daw Khin Saw Myint, 72, who we met while she was waiting in a queue for water, with her little granddaughter by her side. \"We ran out, but my house is gone. I'm living under a tree. Come and see.\"\nShe works as a washerwoman and says her son suffers from a disability which doesn't allow him to work.\n\"Where will I live now? I am in so much trouble. I'm living next to a rubbish dump. Some people have given me rice and a few clothes. We ran out in these clothes we are wearing.\n\"We don't have anyone to rescue us. Please help us,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.\nAnother elderly woman chimes in, eyes tearing up, \"No one has distributed food yet today. So we haven't eaten.\"\nMost of the vehicles we saw pulling up to distribute supplies were small vans with limited stocks - donations from individuals or small local organisations. It's nowhere near enough for the number of people in need, leading to a scramble to grab whatever relief is available.\nParts of Mandalay's main hospital are also damaged, and so in an already difficult situation, rows and rows of beds are laid out in the hospital compound for patients.\nShwe Gy Thun Phyo, 14, has suffered from a brain injury, and has bloodshot eyes. She's conscious but unresponsive. Her father tries to make her as comfortable as possible.\nThere were very few doctors and nurses around to cope with the demand for treatment, which means families are stepping in to do what medical staff should.\nZar Zar has a distended belly because of a serious abdominal injury. Her daughter sits behind her, holding her up, and fans her, to give her some relief from the heat.\nWe couldn't spend a lot of time at the hospital for fear of being apprehended by the police or military.\nAs the window to find survivors of the earthquake narrows, increasingly those being brought into the hospital are the dead.\nNan Sin Hein, who is waiting outside the collapsed building where her son was trapped, was initially stoical, but she now looks like she is preparing to face what seems like the most likely outcome.\n\"I'm heartbroken. My son loved me and his little sisters. He struggled to support us,\" she says.\n\"I am just hoping to see my son's face, even if he is dead. I want to see his body. I want them to do everything they can to find his body.\"",

Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nWe are only two races into the 2025 Formula 1 season and there has already been a major driver change with Red Bull promoting Yuki Tsunoda to replace Liam Lawson.\nTsunoda competes at his home grand prix in Japan this weekend as team-mate to world champion Max Verstappen for the first time, with New Zealander Lawson demoted to Racing Bulls. \nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions on the Red Bull situation and more before the race in Suzuka.\nWhat would be a good season for Yuki Tsunoda after the recent driver switch? - David\nRed Bull's decision to demote Liam Lawson after just two races and put Yuki Tsunoda in the second Red Bull alongside Max Verstappen is nothing less than a career lifeline for Tsunoda.\nThe 24-year-old Japanese was staring at the likely end of his career this season.\nThat's because he owed his seat at the second Red Bull team to Honda, and it is moving to Aston Martin for 2026, where there is no seat available to Tsunoda and no realistic prospect of one.\nWithout Honda, the chances of Racing Bulls keeping Tsunoda for 2026 were slim, when there are other Red Bull juniors coming along the conveyor belt.\nSo a seat alongside Verstappen this year gives him the opportunity to show once and for all that he deserves a long-time place in F1.\nBut what level of performance would do that?\nThe fact remains that Red Bull have a minimum level of expectation for their second driver - and that's to be within about 0.3 seconds a lap of Verstappen on a consistent basis.\nThat's what Tsunoda needs to do to convince Red Bull that he deserves to be considered as a contender for a seat in 2026.\nAnd realistically if he does not do that, he is unlikely to convince anyone else that he is worth investing in either.\nThis video can not be played\nRed Bull's second seat dilemma - F1 Breakdown\nIf Max Verstappen leaves Red Bull are they in even greater trouble than just losing their star driver? It seems like they'd be losing the only person who can drive their car, a situation that's seemingly self-inflicted. Are they likely to be making their 2026 car more driveable to mitigate this risk? - Tom\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Lawson-Tsunoda driver swap is that it gives another perspective on the state Red Bull are in with their car.\nVerstappen believes it is the fourth quickest car in F1 at the moment - so behind the McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari. Although on average qualifying pace in the three sessions so far, it is actually second fastest behind the McLaren.\nBut it may be that it is only both of those things with Verstappen in it.\nThe issue for Red Bull is that they have one genius-level driver and one average one, in F1 terms - and that remains the case with Tsunoda in the second seat, or at least that's what most would believe right now.\nSo it's almost a case of split the difference between the drivers to judge the level of the car.\nThe bottom line seems to be that the new Red Bull is simply not that good a car, and certainly one which is unpredictable and does not generate confidence in a driver. Even Verstappen finds it difficult to drive - but he is so good that he is able to coax a good lap time out of it.\nVerstappen is regarded by most as the best driver in F1 at the moment - so if that's true, it stands to reason that the car would be worse with pretty much anyone else in it.\nIt seems Red Bull have chased peak aerodynamic performance at the expense of drivability - which is ironic, because that is exactly the opposite of the philosophy that Adrian Newey has championed throughout his career.\nLegendary designer Newey, who stopped working on Red Bull in F1 last April, and has just come to the end of his first month with Aston Martin, has always believed that it was better to have slightly less downforce that the driver can use all of, than more theoretical downforce that can't be accessed because the car is too \"peaky\". Or, as Lawson put it, the \"window\" is too narrow.\nLike all teams, Red Bull designed the best car they could for the new season. The question that hangs over them now is, do they know how to fix it?\nAfter another very dry sprint race in China I wonder again why F1 doesn't give the teams tyres that enables the drivers to race through a sprint. Surely the point of the sprint is it is fast, exciting and full of action? - Richard\nThis is a question about tyre management. The fact is that - with a few very limited exceptions - drivers have never been able to race flat out since Pirelli entered F1 as the tyre supplier in 2011.\nThat's not how their tyres work. Pirelli tyres have to be managed to stay within a temperature window.\nDrive them flat out and they overheat. And if they overheat, they rarely come back to optimum grip level. Sometimes this is even the case over a single qualifying lap.\nPirelli has been asked before to provide tyres that can be driven flat out, but so far it has not done so.\nThis video can not be played\nSwapped seats & shaky starts: What to know before Japanese Grand Prix\nIs this season a write-off for Aston Martin? - Carlos\nIt's not looking good so far, is it?\nOn average, the Aston Martin is the seventh fastest car over a single lap over the first three races of the season, including the China sprint. Only the Alpine, Sauber and Haas have been slower.\nIt's fair to say that Fernando Alonso has not had his best start to a season, and mistakes in qualifying at both races so far have hurt the team's ultimate potential.\nSo, it's not completely clear yet what the car's ceiling is.\nAston Martin came into this season with two main aims - to produce a more drivable car, and to prove that they could solve the correlation issues they have had between simulation and the real world and design upgrades that perform as expected.\nThe drivers say that it is more drivable than last year - it's just not that quick.\nIf they can prove their upgrades work, then the season will be at least a qualified success, regardless of the performance of the car to some extent.\nSo it is probably fair to wait for at least the first upgrade package - which would typically be expected around May some time - before forming any firm conclusions.\nHow to follow Japanese Grand Prix on the BBC\nWhat's the future for F1 engines and why is it up for debate?\nIs there a circuit(s) you'd really want on the calendar that currently isn't on there? And at the expense of which current circuit(s)? I love Fuji and I'm not a fan of street circuits \u2013 RAP\nThe F1 calendar has a pretty good selection of circuits at the moment.\nThere are some obvious candidates in the United States - Road America and Laguna Seca are both great circuits. But then so is Austin, and both Miami and Las Vegas work for the sport on a financial level.\nBathurst in Australia is awesome - but not suitable for F1, sadly.\nAs for Fuji, great backdrop, when the clouds are not covering Mount Fuji, but as a circuit it is not a patch on Suzuka.\nThe one big miss in terms of the calendar is France. Somehow, it seems wrong not to have a grand prix in the country that gave birth to motorsport and hosted the first race with that title, even if Monaco is regarded as a sort of proxy French race.\nThe problem is that France's only circuits with licences for F1 are Paul Ricard and Magny-Cours. Uninspiring both.\nBut if the Sarthe circuit at Le Mans could be brought up to F1 standard and host a grand prix, that would be quite something.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

        "article_text": "\"Incredible.\" That was the single word uttered under her breath by Marine Le Pen as she stormed out of a Paris courtroom on Monday morning.\nShe left the court early \u2013 just before hearing that she was barred from running for office for five years after being found guilty of embezzlement of EU funds \u2013 almost certainly ruling her out from standing in the 2027 French presidential election.\nWithout even waiting for the judge to pronounce the full details of the sentence, the head of the National Rally knew that her political goose was cooked.\nThere would be no reprieve pending appeal. The bar on running for office was real and immediate.\nA four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended, will be on hold pending appeal.\nBut her political plans are dead.\nLe Pen's incredulity can be better excused, perhaps, in the context of the moment.\nA consensus had almost established itself across France's political world that this ultimate sanction by the court could not, would not \u2013 in the end \u2013 take place.\nIt was not just Le Pen's followers who said it. Her enemies agreed, from Jean-Luc Melenchon on the far left to Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou in the centre and Justice Minister G\u00e9rard Darmanin on the right.\nBut they were all wrong.  The judge said that the law was the law.\nThe law had in fact recently been toughened \u2013 by the very politicians who were now complaining about its application \u2013 to make the penalty for misuse of public funds very severe indeed.  Well, said the judge in so many words, now let politicians suck up their own medicine.\nMaybe Marine Le Pen was naive in not predicting this outcome. It certainly appears as if her National Rally party was singularly unprepared for it.\nSo as they met in an emergency session after the verdict, party leaders were in a dilemma.\nDo they continue as if there is still a chance Marine Le Pen will run in 2027?\nIn theory there is still a (small) possibility.  She has launched an appeal. The appeal could be accelerated and take place at the end of this year or early 2026. A verdict would follow in the spring.\nA different decision at the appeal hearing could lessen the period of ineligibility, or remove it altogether \u2013 in which case she could still run.  But the chances must be regarded as slim.\nOr, should they proceed with plan B \u2013 that is to say, with naming party president Jordan Bardella as de facto the man who will run in Marine Le Pen's place?\nThat might be a more realistic assessment of what lies ahead. But to turn to Bardella too quickly would be unseemly.  And anyway, not everyone in the party is a fan.\nBy the evening the choice had been made: in a TV appearance Marine Le Pen came out fighting, saying she had no plans to retreat from the political scene.\nDenouncing what she called a \"political\" decision by the judge and a \"violation of the state of law\", she called for a swift appeal trial, so that her name could be cleared \u2013 or at least the ineligibility lifted \u2013 in time for the 2027 vote.\n\"There are millions of French people who believe in me. For 30 years I have been fighting against injustice. It is what I shall continue to do right to the end,\" she said.\nFighting words \u2013 but in reality the future looks very unclear. And there are many unanswered questions.\nWhat, for example, will the effect of the court decision be on the RN vote?\nIn the short term we can expect an outcry, and a boost to the party's support.  Why? Because what has happened fits so neatly into the RN narrative that the populist right is a victim of the \"system\".\nNo-one likely to vote for the RN seriously holds it against Marine Le Pen for illegally financing her party using EU parliament funds.  They all know that practically every French political party has resorted to similar underhand methods in the past.\nBy the same token,  her \"draconian\" punishment \u2013 being banned from standing for the presidency \u2013 will be interpreted as a badge of honour: proof that she alone is standing up to the powers-that-be.\nLonger term, though, the boost may not be so powerful.  The truth is that Marine Le Pen is a huge asset to the RN.  This battle-hardened, sentimental, cat-loving,  tough-talking,  long-suffering woman is held in affection by her supporters, who feel they know her personally.\nJordan Bardella is a popular figure too, but at just 29 it is hard to see him filling her shoes. If Marine Le Pen is indeed unable to run in 2027, the RN loses much of its appeal.\nWhat is certain is that many would-be candidates on the non-RN right \u2013 Laurent Wauquiez, Bruno Retailleau for example \u2013 would see in a Bardella candidacy a big opportunity for themselves.\nThe other unknown is vengeance.\nMarine Le Pen remains a member of the National Assembly, where she leads a bloc of 125 \u2013 the parliament's biggest.  Till now she had been benign towards the beleaguered prime minister Francois Bayrou, who struggles on despite having no majority.\nThose days may be over.   \nWhy should we do anyone any favours now, they will be saying at RN HQ. Why not bring the house down?",

I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 \u2013 given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80. \n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.",

        "article_text": "The bacteria and fungi living on your skin play a surprising role in keeping us healthy. Is it possible to give them a boost?\nScratch the surface of the skin, and you'll find a bustling community of bacteria living there. This is a good thing, as research increasingly shows that having the \"right kind\" of microbes can help keep our skin young, supple, and smooth for longer. Simply by being there, \"good bacteria\" protect us from infection from pathogenic, harmful microbes. They also help to repair wounds and may even counteract some of the harmful effects of UV rays.\u00a0\nAll-the-more reason to look after our skin microbiome. But how do we do this? One method that has become increasingly popular is the use of topical skin probiotics \u2013 which technically means applying live microorganisms to the skin to improve its health.\nAs far back as 1912, scientists were rubbing bacteria into people's faces in an attempt to improve conditions such as acne and seborrhea \u2013 a common form of dermatitis that causes a red, itchy rash and white or yellow scales.\nToday there are dozens of skincare companies selling what they describe as probiotic products, from serums to cleansers and moisturisers. In each case, the balms offer to rebalance the delicate skin microbiome, leaving it \"renewed\" and \"refreshed\".\u00a0\nBut while skincare products often claim to be \"probiotic\", very few, if any, actually contain live bacteria.\nWhat's more, as probiotic skin treatments are classed as \"cosmetics\" and not medicines, their manufacturers don't have to share the results of any trials that have been conducted on their products, so it's difficult to know how effective they are.\u00a0\n\"The rules around skin care products are very different to the rules around drugs, so claims can be made with less rigorous testing than would be made for a pharmaceutical agent,\" says Richard Gallo, a dermatologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine.\nMost \"probiotic\" skincare products contain either prebiotics \u2013 nutrients that feed and encourage the growth of good bacteria on the skin, or postbiotics \u2013 proteins or other products made by beneficial bacteria.\n\"What we are seeing more and more are approaches that try to influence the microbiome,\" says Bernhard Paetzold, co-founder and chief scientific officer of\u00a0S-Biomedic, a company that aims to treat conditions by restoring the skin's microbiome through bacterial \"transplants\".\nAccording to Paetzold, the main reason for this is that live bacteria are extremely difficult to keep alive throughout the manufacturing, storing and distribution process. Once on the skin there's no guarantee that they'll even take hold, as they must fight to compete with the millions of other microbes already living there.\nThe idea of promoting a healthy skin microbiome is rooted in the theory that bacteria and fungi living on the outside of our body help to protect us from those that might do us harm.\nYet the science behind how certain \"bad\" bacteria can contribute to skin diseases isn't yet fully understood. What we do know is that people with eczema, rosacea, acne and psoriasis all have different types or levels of certain bacteria living on their skin.\n\"What exists at the moment is a lot of papers showing that nearly every skin disease imaginable is associated with a shift in the skin microbiome,\" says Paetzold. \"But this observation just shows an association. It doesn't say that the shift in the microbiome causes that disease. It could also be that the disease changes the skin environment, and that's why the bacterial population changes.\"\nTo prove that a particular strain of bacteria is causing a disease, you would need to either give a healthy person that skin disease by slathering the \"bad bacteria\" on their face, or cure their disease by applying \"good\" bacteria. While the first option is likely to encounter ethical barriers, there are a few researchers attempting the latter.\nThe limited clinical trials that have been published, however, do show promising results. Most focus on using live bacteria to treat eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis. They are based on the findings that the skin of people with eczema is dominated by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that can often be pathogenic.\n\"One of the big problems in the skin for diseases like eczema, is that certain pathogenic bacteria like S. aureus live on the surface of the skin and cause rashes, cause disease, and cause infection,\" says Gallo, whose own research group has been searching for ways of harnessing the skin microbiome to fight off the harmful bacteria found thriving on eczema patients. \"We mined the bacteria types that usually live on healthy skin looking for bacteria that could produce things that would fight off those bad bacteria\".\nGallo's are focusing on Staphylococcus hominis, a naturally occurring skin bacterium which is present in 21% of healthy people, but only 1% of atopic dermatitis patients.\n\"Our skin provides commensal bacteria like S. hominis with a safe place to live, so some of them have evolved a way of protecting their environment from these bad bacteria that are trying to invade,\" says Gallo.\nIn the case of S. hominis, the bacterium produces anti-microbial peptides \u2013 small fragments of protein \u2013 which directly kill S. aureus. They also produce chemicals called \"autoinducing peptides\", which stop bacterial cells from communicating with one another. Some bacteria like S. aureus signal to one another when their population density reaches a certain level \u2013 a mechanism known as quorum sensing \u2013 triggering the secretion of toxins that can cause skin inflammation. Disrupting that communication can prevent the toxins from being released.\nIn 2021, Gallo's team conducted a phase one randomised controlled trial with 54 adults with atopic dermatitis by applying a cream containing live S. hominis over the course of one week. The results showed that treatment with S. hominis dramatically reduced S. aureus\u00a0colonisation, and even decreased the redness and itch associated with atopic dermatitis in a subgroup of patients compared to a control group given a placebo cream.\nThe findings suggest that using special formulations of living bacteria could well help to make the skin's microbiome healthier. But more work needs to be done to prove its effectiveness before it can be used as a treatment. The team are now recruiting for a phase two randomised trial which will assess the efficacy of the treatment over a longer 14 week timescale.\u00a0\nElsewhere, other researchers have also had success treating eczema with probiotics. In one 2003 clinical trial, 11 patients with atopic dermatitis were given a cream containing the bacterium\u00a0Streptococcus thermophiles, which they applied for two weeks. The results showed\u00a0that the cream enhanced the skin's production of ceramides \u2013 lipids that help to keep the skin hydrated and maintain it as a healthy barrier.\u00a0\nMore recently, in 2018 10 adults and five children with atopic dermatitis were given a \"microbiome transplant\", where live Roseomonas mucosa bacteria collected from the skin of healthy volunteers was then applied to the skin of the patients twice a week. After 16 weeks, the treatment improved their symptoms by more than 50%.\nAlthough clinical trials focusing on other skin conditions are somewhat rarer, they also show promising results. Acne, for example, is linked to colonisation by the bacterium Cutibacterium acnes. Some researchers are therefore looking for bacteria that produce antimicrobial peptides to inhibit or kill this bacterium. In one clinical trial, a lotion containing\u00a0the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis\u00a0was given to patients suffering from severe acne. The lotion significantly reduced pustules compared to a placebo lotion.\nPaetzold and his company S-Biomedic, meanwhile, published a clinical trial in 2019 where they gave patients with acne a cream containing specific strains of Cutibacterium acnes. The results showedsome reduction in acne.\u00a0\nGallo is also researching whether a strain of Staphylococcus capitis bacteria could be an effective acne treatment, with studies in animals showing promising results.\u00a0\n\"The basic mechanism of action is very straightforward. It just inhibits the C. acnes growth, much in the same way that topical antibiotics or oral antibiotics are used to treat acne,\" says Gallo.\u00a0\nUnlike topical antibiotics, however, the treatment specifically targets C. acnes, so the wider skin microbiome is left unharmed, he says.\nGallo's team has even found a specific strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria that produce molecules that may inhibit the development of sun induced skin cancer.\n\"It generates a small molecule that inhibits DNA synthesis in transformed or mutagenic skin cells,\" says Gallo. \"We've found in \nanimal models\n that if these bacteria are present on the surface of mice that undergo UV radiation damage, they get far fewer skin tumours than mice that have the same species of bacteria, but not the genes [in the bacteria] that make this anti-metabolite.\"\nOf course, such a treatment will have to go through much more testing and clinical trials before it can be shown to have a similar effect in humans.\nWhile most studies have looked at treating specific diseases with probiotics, there are also a few that have examined whether pre- or postbiotics could improve skin health generally.\u00a0 For example, some researchers are looking at whether inulin \u2013 a dietary fibre frequently found in cosmetics and personal care products \u2013 could serve as a prebiotic when taken as an oral supplement or applied topically to the skin. Preliminary results suggest that inulin makes the skin more smooth and supple, providing a more favourable environment for beneficial bacteria to thrive. Other studies have shown that slapping on sphingomyelinase, an\u00a0enzyme produced by bacteria such as Staphylococcus thermophilus \u2013 which are commonly found in fermented milk products and yogurt \u2013 can boost production of ceramides, which are needed to keep the skin healthy.\nHowever in all cases, large randomised double blind clinical trials \u2013 the gold standard of medical research \u2013 are needed to confirm whether any of these creams are effective.\u00a0\nFor example a recent review study examined all of the data from clinical trials conducted to date and concluded that while \"oral and topical probiotics appear to be effective for the treatment of certain inflammatory skin diseases and demonstrate a promising role in wound healing and skin cancer, more studies are needed to confirm these results\".\u00a0\nGallo agrees that more work is needed but is hopeful about the future of the field.\n\"It's moving in the right direction,\" he says. \"We've come to realise as a field that we need to understand what exactly they're doing, and there's a lot of efforts being put into that, as well as other ways to design microbes to help benefit us. So I'm very optimistic about where we'll be in a few years with probiotics.\"\nHowever for people who don't have a skin disease, but who might want to increase the smoothness of their skin, prevent wrinkles, or boost hydration levels, there is little evidence that probiotic creams readily available in shops will have any benefit.\n\"I think many of the probiotics on the market now don't have very strong evidence behind them, so I wouldn't recommend those necessarily,\" says Gallo. \"You can try them \u2013 but it might not be the best use of your money.\"\nWhile your skin microbiome changes as you age and encounter different environments, there are a few things you can do to help your skin's natural microbiome flourish.\n\"It's a two-way street, because the types of things that we're already doing to moisturise our skin or protect the skin from UV damage are creating an environment that's more hospitable for these beneficial organisms to live in,\" says Gallo.\n\"So normal skin care, appropriate moisturising and cleansing \u2013 all of those things will promote skin health.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "For many years, well-off Nigerians have sent their children to prestigious British boarding schools - but now some of those institutions are setting up campuses in Africa's most populous nation.\nLast year, Charterhouse launched a primary school in the city of Lagos and will open a secondary school this September.\nRugby School will also begin offering secondary education in September. Other well-known institutions, such as Millfield, Wellington College and Harrow, are also exploring opportunities in Nigeria.\nThis obviously all comes with a price tag for Nigerian parents - but the country's well-heeled elite have historically sent their children to the UK for secondary education, drawn to the British curriculum's rigour, prestige and global opportunities.\n\"I'm actually excited about it,\" says Karima Oyede, a British-Nigerian management consultant, whose son is currently in year 10 at Rugby in the UK but will be moving to its Lagos school in September.\nHer family has been meaning to relocate to Nigeria for a while but has not done so earlier because of the children's education.\n\"Having the opportunity to experience the British system in his country of origin is the best of both worlds,\" she says.\nNigeria already has a proliferation of private schools but high-quality, internationally recognised education within the country will appeal to many parents, particularly those who wish to preserve their children's cultural identity.\n\"African parents love the fact that they are giving their children international standing so they can compete with their counterparts in any other part of the world, but they don't want their children to lose their African-ness,\" says Ijay Uwakwe-Okoronkwo, the founder of Nkuzhi Learning Foundation in Nigeria's capital, Abuja.\nThe educational consultant, who advises parents and schools on international boarding options, explains the more relaxed, less respectful attitude children return with after going to school abroad is not always appreciated.\nThis cultural dilemma extends to the growing conversation around LGBTQ issues. Same-sex relationships and public displays of affection are illegal in Nigeria and homosexuality is not openly discussed or promoted.\nIt is something that the new crop of British schools has taken on board. For example, while Charterhouse UK displays a rainbow flag, the Nigeria school does not.\n\"We're a British independent school but sitting firmly within Nigerian cultural needs,\" says John Todd, head of Charterhouse Nigeria.\n\"There's this huge concern about Western cultural views.\n\"For parents here, we know it's a really big issue. It's a reason parents are worried about the UK schools.\n\"I'm not making a judgement - it's just the way it is.\"\nBritish institutions in Nigeria have no choice but to \"follow the law of the land\", he acknowledges, adding: \"We are 100% compliant.\"\nRecognising Nigeria's deeply religious society, Charterhouse also permits parents to take their children home from the boarding house for Sunday church services, with the expectation that they return by Monday morning.\nThere are several reasons behind the growing interest of prestigious British schools in opening campuses in Nigeria.\nWhile regions like the Middle East and China are already saturated with international schools, Africa is relatively virgin territory.\n\"Nigeria is the gateway to Africa, and Africa is kind of the last continent for British schools to establish in,\" says Mark Brooks, an export champion for the UK's Department for Business and Trade.\nHe organises annual events in Nigeria where about 20 British schools meet prospective students and parents.\n\"Nigeria has an incredible reputation for producing driven, high-achieving students,\" says Mr Brooks.\n\"There is no school I work with that hasn't recently had a Nigerian student serve as head boy or deputy head boy. A student may join the sixth form and end up being the head boy within a year.\n\"I've brought hundreds of head teachers to Nigeria over the years, and the word is out in the UK that we need to take Nigeria seriously.\"\nTiming has also proved key, as the cost of sending children to the UK has soared. Just three years ago, the exchange rate of the local currency was 500 naira to \u00a31; now it stands at 2,200 naira.\nOn top of that, the Labour government in the UK recently imposed 20% VAT on private school fees.\nBeyond tuition, families face additional expenses like flights for both students and visiting parents.\nEstablishing these schools in Nigeria allows families to maintain the same standard of education while significantly reducing the financial strain.\nThe annual fees at Charterhouse UK, for example, are around \u00a360,000 ($78,000), whereas the fees at its Lagos campus are equivalent to approximately \u00a315,000.\n\"Our main classroom teachers are expatriates, but 90% of the staff are local,\" says Mr Todd.\nBy employing local people in roles such as assistant teachers, administration, finance, human resources, marketing, facilities, security, gardeners, drivers, PAs and secretaries, the school can significantly reduce costs compared to the UK, where labour is much more expensive.\nA vast education gap already exists in Nigeria, with many parents opting for private education of varying quality. Many struggle to pay the higher fees rather than sending their children to government schools, which are often free but plagued by poorly trained teachers and frequent strikes.\nAs a result, the arrival of British schools may not drastically change Nigeria's education system.\nHowever, they could pose a threat to established elite schools like the British International School in Lagos and The Regent School in Abuja, which opened in the early 2000s.\nSuch schools have long been top choices for those able to pay the annual tuition fees that often reach tens of thousands of dollars.\n\"Rugby School Nigeria is coming also to support, develop and learn from the schools currently in Nigeria,\" says Mr Brooks, who is in charge of the school's marketing.\n\"We are coming to help with partnerships as well, teacher training, and a whole range of initiatives.\"\nMr Todd believes the Nigerian market is large enough to accommodate all the new schools without threatening existing ones. About 40% of the 200 million population is under 14.\nHe expects the greatest impact to be felt in the UK.\nWhile Charterhouse UK typically has a long waiting list and should not be affected, less sought-after boarding schools may experience a decline in enrolment owing to the new competition in Nigeria.\n\"Interest in our secondary school is very strong,\" says Mr Todd. \"We already have Nigerian parents in the UK sending their children to the Charterhouse in Nigeria for September.\"\nIn fact, reaching out to Nigerians in the UK has been one of their key marketing strategies.\n\"You get this premier brand at a lower price, and every Nigerian has an aunt or uncle in Lagos\" who can be a guardian, he adds.\nIt could be that this trend extends to British universities. Nigeria's tertiary education system faces even greater challenges than its secondary sector, with many students opting to study abroad.\nIn 2023, Nigeria ranked among the top 10 countries for UK student visas, according to UK government data.\nBut with foreign exchange difficulties and stricter visa regulations, studying abroad is becoming increasingly challenging - and universities that rely on higher international tuition fees appear to be suffering.\nEarlier this month, British MP Helen Hayes, chair of the parliamentary Education Committee, acknowledged the UK's higher education sector was in trouble.\n\"Dozens of universities are making redundancies and cuts to courses, trying to stay afloat amid uncertainty over where their money is coming from,\" she said when announcing a session to consider the sector's future.\nIf enough Nigerian students can no longer go to the UK to study, British universities may find it profitable to come to them, as they have elsewhere in the world.\nIn fact, Nigeria's premier university, the University of Ibadan, was established in 1948 as a campus of the University of London, with degrees awarded carrying the same value and prestige.\nMs Uwakwe-Okoronkwo believes many Nigerian parents would appreciate this opportunity, as it would allow their children to stay in Nigeria long enough to mature before potentially moving abroad, if they choose to do so.\n\"Many parents are worried about sending their children out of the nest too early,\" she says.\nFor Ms Oyede, whose daughter will also be starting at Rugby School in Lagos come September, the timing of all this could not be better.\nShe says the British school opening has already been an \"incentive to return home\". \nThe prospect of university opportunities would be a welcome bonus.\nAdaobi Tricia Nwaubani is a freelance Nigerian journalist and novelist based in Abuja and London.\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica",

        "article_text": "Living with some of the world's most remote tribal communities has changed filmmaker and indigenous right activist Bruce Parry.\n\"I started out as an adventurer,\" he says. \"It was all ego \u2013 I wanted to climb the biggest mountain, go and find the tribe that no one's visited to show the world how tough I was.\"\nAcross three series of the BAFTA-winning Tribe, viewers have seen Parry taking the psychedelic drug ayahuasca, having his nose pierced with a thorn and taking part in numerous rituals. Now, the series is returning to screens for the first time since 2007.\nHe was in his mid-30s in the first series of Tribe - and he has just turned 56. \n\"Initially on the show, my whole remit was to not say anything and to experience,\" he says.\n\"Now, I am much more knowledgeable, and that made it harder to be that wide-eyed character. \n\"I'm not the same guy any more.\"\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of animal cruelty some readers may find distressing.\nWhile trying to understand the communities he visits, Parry sometimes encounters difficult situations. \nAmong Angola's Mucubal community, for example, custom demands that as a guest, he must sacrifice a goat in a way expected within the group \u2013 that is, by suffocating it.\n\"They do it because they see it as respectful,\" says Parry. In the episode, he says this is the \"most gruesome thing\" he has ever been a part of.\n\"I knew how that was going to feel to some members of the audience,\" he says, adding that some might see it as \"barbaric\".\nDespite finding it upsetting, he says he was able to get through it by thinking on a global scale.\n\"If you take these people as a whole, they are not a problem on this planet,\" he says, arguing, in his view, that by doing things like eating meat \"you are contributing to so much more that is potentially negative and impactful on the planet\".\nIn his new three-part BBC series, he lives among three remote communities. He conducts a sacred ritual with Colombia's Waimaha people, lives among Angola's Mucubal community and visits Indonesia's Marapu.\nBehind the scenes, Parry's team works hard to make sure their visits are not just what he calls \"coming to take away their images [by filming them] and take them home\".\nInstead, he refers to his time with the remote communities as an \"exchange\", with his team often trading gifts with the people he visits.\nIn the past, he has given equipment, from boats to a machine used to grind sorghum - a staple grain in Africa and Asia. And in the show, we see him receive items in return in the form of livestock or other items culturally important to each community.\n\"Sometimes they just want guns,\" Parry says, \"but as the BBC, we can't quite do that.\"\nHe adds: \"We haven't ever really approached anyone that isn't really excited for us to come. I've never really had a sense that people didn't want me there.\"\nThere may, however, be some wariness based on negative experience with outsiders. \nThe Waimaha, whose culture was nearly decimated by rubber tappers and missionaries, for example, make Parry sleep away from them until he has gained their trust.\nEach episode reveals some of the other outside factors facing each community. \nThe region of Angola that Parry visits was inaccessible for decades because of landmines left during that country's civil war. And the Mucubal group feel the effects of climate change as the desert they live in gets hotter and drier.\nParry says he brings these issues to our attention after identifying what he saw as a problem with the original series.\n\"You could be forgiven for watching those first episodes and thinking that these people were living in pristine environments in the middle of nowhere, untouched by the outside world,\" he says.\n\"We used to get people saying it was questionable to go to these places and change them by our presence.\n\"To some degree, we are doing that, but our impact on those people was a drop in the ocean compared to all the other forces of change, the globalisation, the miners, the loggers and the missionaries.\"\nWhile travelling, Parry says he often finds unexpected similarities in how people live their lives.\nThe Mucubal, for example, knock out some of their bottom teeth and file down their front two. In the show, Parry says: \"The things we do for beauty\" - hinting at dental and cosmetic procedures common around the world. \nOther communities have very different practices - but Parry thinks we can learn from them. The Marapu live among the graves of their dead ancestors, giving them a unique bond.\n\"I'm not here to put any group on a pedestal,\" he says, \"we're all human, but there is definitely always something that we can learn from each other. \n\"And actually, the more different you are, probably the more there is for us to learn.\"\nNow, he says his guiding principle is \"the more you can try and see the world through another person's eyes, the more you can reflect on your own life and your own culture. \n\"And that's where wisdom comes.\"",

        "article_text": "In Jordan, a 50km pilgrimage trail follows the path of a 4th-Century nun who journeyed through the Holy Land \u2013 centuries before Spain's famed Camino de Santiago.\nThe hike begins early in the morning at Mount Nebo, a sacred mountain 610m above sea level in Jordan. On a clear day, panoramic views of the Dead Sea, Bethlehem and Jerusalem stretch across the horizon. According to the Bible, it is the last place Moses gazed upon before his death. Today, it's the first sight walkers see as they set out on their journey along the Camino de Egeria, a pilgrim route first taken by a 4th-Century nun.\u00a0\nThe view is \"magical\", says Silvano Mezzenzana, who recently undertook the three-day hike. He recalls standing atop that peak on the Moab plateau, a dry Sun fanning out over the ridges and farmland beneath, noting that it is fascinating both in the morning when the Sun lights up the Palestinian bank and the city of Jericho, and in the afternoon when the sunset draws the silhouettes of the hills of Judah up to Jerusalem. Up there, \"you do not realise that you are on a mountain\", he adds.\u00a0\nBeginning on the eastern edge of the Great Rift Valley, the 50km route winds through farmland and rugged hills \u2013 a voyage that is far greener than its European equivalent, the 800km Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail undertaken by around 500,000 people each year. Following the January announcement from Jordan and Spain of a merger twinning the Camino de Egeria with the Camino de Santiago to boost their respective cultural heritage, locals hope that the newly-renovated Middle Eastern trail can become a similar phenomenon. The goal is to highlight the significance of the eponymous Egeria, the Spanish nun believed to have travelled by donkey from Jordan through Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Asia Minor to visit the holy places recounted in the Bible. She is thought to be the first woman to make the journey, which pre-dates the famed Camino de Santiago by five centuries.\u00a0\nThe hike is typically split up into three days (though can be done as quickly as in two, or a leisurely five). The terrain is not particularly challenging, but the distance \u2013 of around 17km per day \u2013 makes the hike unsuitable for total novices.\u00a0Last year, wide paths were fixed between the rocky valleys and hills along much of the route, ushering in what the Ministry of Tourism hopes will mark a new era for international interest in the country.\u00a0\nThe effort is already seeing results. \"Although I have lived in Jordan all my life, walking this trail has shown me parts of the country I've never experienced before,\" says Nadeen Dabbas. She recalls the flow of the water at the Moses Springs and the Jordan Valley, where she was surrounded by fields of bananas and corn, as moments that \"made me feel alive\".\nThe Best of 2025\nJordan was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good.\u00a0See the full list here.\nThe first major landmark on day one features a small monastery built by Egyptian monks in Moses' memory, built in the latter half of the 4th Century, enlarged a century later and rebuilt in the 6th Century to a mosaic-filled basilica that still stands today. The trail then passes through the ancient city of Livias, before reaching its showpiece on day two: Al-Maghatas, or Bethany beyond the Jordan. A Unesco World Heritage site, this is believed to be the location where Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist. Pilgrims can explore Byzantine and Roman remains of chapels, churches and monasteries, along with the cave of John the Baptist, and even \"spend the second night there in one of the pilgrim houses of Bethany, just next to the Jordan River\", explains Oscar Koshebye, a guide who helped formalise the current tourist trail. The route finishes here, or at the King Hussein Bridge at the Jordan-Israel border.\nWhile the hike offers striking natural beauty, the real draw may prove to be the woman who likely inspired it. \"Egeria's account is significant because it is one of the oldest written accounts of pilgrimage to the Holy Land that has survived \u2013 and the first incontrovertibly penned by a woman,\" says Anne McGowan, associate professor of liturgy at the Catholic Theological Union and co-author of Pilgrimage of Egeria. Egeria's work was little-known until the 1880s, McGowan adds, originally written in the form of letters to her \"sisters\" (likely holy women similar to herself). An incomplete manuscript dating to the 11th Century is currently the oldest known record of her route.\nEgeria travelled during the 4th Century, when many Christians took long-distance pilgrimages \u2013 something that fell out of favour from the 7th Century until around the mid-19th (aside from a \"blip\" in the wake of the Crusades, in the 12th-13th Centuries), McGowan explains. At that point, \"travel to the Holy Land became easier once again. Going on pilgrimage aligned well with the Romantic Era's renewed enthusiasm for the personal and the subjective on the one hand and an idealised past on the other; and Protestants as a group became more intrigued by pilgrimage possibilities connected to places associated with the life and death of Jesus in a way they hadn't been previously.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBut now, with religious appetite dwindling (a study published\u00a0last year\u00a0found that atheists now outnumber theists in the UK), Koshebye is hoping that a new generation can be drawn in. \"We can consider it now, after centuries of abandonment, a route for tolerance between faiths, a way to improve intercultural exchange,\" he says.\u00a0\nPlan your trip\nThe Egeria Way branch office is at the Kawon bookshop in Madaba. From here, registered visitors will be taken to trail's start point, 15km away in Mount Nebo. Packages from different tour operators will soon be offered by the Egeria Way Association. Travel within Jordan is safe, though the UK Foreign Office advises against travel within 3km of the border with Syria.\nThe Spanish national and keen hiker began mulling a walking route to Jerusalem five years ago. Having already walked the Spanish Camino, he mentioned his plans to his father, who likened his son's idea to the devout Egeria \u2013 who he had never heard of. Koshebye began reading about the nun and scouring old maps in search of her original route. He later made a YouTube video about his plans, was contacted by the Jordanian tourist board, and then got in touch with the Spanish embassy in Jordan \u2013 a series of collaborative efforts that led to the merger being born.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Wadi Rum Trail: Jordan's new long-distance hike\n\u2022 A new love for medieval-style travel\n\u2022 The pilgrimage sites of Iraq's timeless and holy cities\nKoshebye hopes that the partnership leads to a surge of interest in this three-day version of the hike and wants it to be extended a further 30km to Jerusalem, another stop on Egeria's route. Plans for signage along the Jordanian route and more guesthouses where walkers can rest in between are already afoot.\nWhile steeped in religious significance, ancient routes of this kind aren't just for those intent on retracing paths drawn by scripture, McGowan says. \"Taking a very long walk still has the capacity to pull one into an inner journey. Younger people are still spiritual seekers, even if their search is typically less closely tied to traditional religious beliefs and practices,\" she believes. \"Their pilgrimages might be more oriented toward the experience of journeying itself, as it seems Egeria's was as well; she does not so much set out on a round trip to visit one particular place, for example, as to experience as many places as possible.\"\nWith time \u2013 and a few more signposts \u2013 those involved in the project hope that Jordan's historic trail can achieve the same cultural significance as its Spanish counterpart. Mezzenzano, for one, has no doubt. \"I would not only recommend\" the trail, he enthuses, \"but I plan to repeat it\". \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "More than 20 legal claims of historical abuse at Celtic Boys Club have been settled for a seven-figure sum.\nAbout 30 former players had launched a class action against Celtic for damages.\nThompsons Solicitors said that 70% of those cases had now been settled and that further settlements are expected in the coming weeks.\nCeltic said it was \"very sorry that these events took place at Celtic Boys Club\" and that it took the abuse \"extremely seriously because of the historic contacts between the two organisations\".\nSeveral former coaches and officials at the boys club have been convicted in recent years of sexual offences against teenage players spanning decades.\nIn 2023, a judge gave the go-ahead for a class action group litigation - where people sue on behalf of a much larger group - to proceed against Celtic for alleged abuses at Celtic Boys Club.\nLaura Connor, from Thompsons Solicitors, said the firm's clients had wanted their voices to be heard.\n\"This litigation has been made far more complex and lengthy by the defender, while our clients have acted with resolute dignity throughout,\" she said.\n\"At long last they have achieved success and can take this compensation as confirmation that Celtic Boys Club was indeed inextricably linked to Celtic Football Club.\"\nShe said those involved in the case had been \"very angry\" at how long it had taken to reach a conclusion, but that there was now a sense of relief.\nShe added that Celtic had not made any formal admission of liability or any apology.\nThompsons said settlements had been agreed in 22 of the 28 cases involved in the group proceedings.\nA further eight cases are still outstanding. These involved abuse by former coach Jim McCafferty, who died in prison in 2022.\nIn a statement, Celtic confirmed that a number of legal claims against the club had been resolved.\nIt said it hoped that settlements could soon be reached with the remaining group members.\n\"The club acknowledges the strength of the survivors of abuse who have come forward, and hope that this resolution may help to bring them some closure,\" it said.\n\"Celtic Football Club is appalled by any form of historic abuse and has great sympathy for those who suffered abuse and for their families.\n\"The club is very sorry that these events took place at Celtic Boys' Club. The club takes this abuse extremely seriously because of the historic contacts between the two organisations.\"\nFor the victims of the predatory coaches at Celtic Boys Club, this has been a long time coming.\nThe litigation relates to historical claims of sexual assault by convicted paedophiles Jim Torbett - the founder of the boys club - and Frank Cairney, a former coach.\nIn 2017, the BBC Scotland Disclosure team first revealed a series of fresh allegations against Torbett, who had previously been jailed for abusing three players in the 1970s.\nThe team tracked him down to California and he was soon arrested and jailed.\nCairney, another former coach, was also jailed as more and more victims came forward demanding justice.\nThe boys club, which was established in 1966, was perhaps the most successful feeder club of its generation in Scotland.\nIt had close ties to the senior club, sharing players, officials and premises.

        "article_text": "Liverpool are out of the Champions League and lost the Carabao Cup final, but how will they respond as they resume their Premier League title bid?\nThe leaders, who host neighbours Everton on Wednesday, are 12 points clear with nine games to go.\n\"I can see this being another explosive Merseyside derby, like the last one was,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"But after the international break Liverpool will be absolutely bursting to get out there and put things right.\"\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.\nFor week 30, he takes on Liam Hincks from Liverpool DJ & producer duo Tigerblind, who is a lifelong Everton fan.\nTigerblind have teamed up with world-renowned dance label Ministry of Sound for their latest single, Battery Operated.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nTiesto, Medusa and Danny Howard have played Tigerblind's latest track, Battery Operated, in their live sets. When Tiesto featured it in his set in Tulum, Mexico, it sparked thousands of TikTok creations across multiple sounds\nLiam enjoyed the end of the last Merseyside derby to be played at Goodison Park, when James Tarkowski's 98th-minute goal earned Everton a dramatic point in February, but he is not relishing Wednesday's meeting at Anfield.\n\"I am dreading it, to be honest, for a couple reasons,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"Firstly, because of the way Liverpool are at the moment - they are absolutely flying in the league - and also because of just how bad our record is there.\"\nEverton won at Anfield in 2021, but that is their only victory there in their past 28 visits in all competitions since 1999.\nThe Toffees do go into this game in decent form, however. They are on a nine-game unbeaten run in the league under David Moyes, who replaced Sean Dyche in January.\n\"I got to know Sean quite well, and he is a lovely guy,\" Liam added. \"He came to see us play at Pacha in Ibiza last summer and he was a really good laugh.\n\"From getting the other side of things from him, I did feel for him when he left. I guess that is football, though, and sometimes things don't work out.\n\"Moyes has come back and he obviously has a connection with the club and a lot of history. He has started to get more of a tune out of some of the players a bit more than Dyche did, especially Beto up front.\n\"I think the biggest thing Moyes has done is to give him confidence. It will be interesting once Dominic Calvert-Lewin comes back from injury to see how he responds to Moyes too, because he hasn't played much under him.\n\"Fair play to Beto, though. There was a lot of pressure on his shoulders with a new manager coming in, and the team not scoring, but the run he has gone on [five goals in nine league games under Moyes] is just fantastic - at any other club he'd be a \u00a360m striker!\"\nChris Sutton and Liam Hincks were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nEmirates Stadium, 19:45 BST\nArsenal's title hopes may only be faint but they have still got to try to exert a bit of pressure on Liverpool.\nWin this, and they are nine points behind the leaders before Arne Slot's side play again. I want to see Liverpool pushed, and no other result will do.\nIt won't be easy for Arsenal, though - I was at the reverse fixture at Craven Cottage in December, which finished 1-1, and that was a typical Fulham performance in that they were dangerous on the counter-attack.\nThey showed that day what a capable side they are, and they have several former Arsenal players in their squad who will want to prove a point again too.\nMarco Silva's side had a disappointing defeat at home to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup on Saturday, but they actually played really well in the first half of that game.\nIt's hard to know where some teams are at form wise, coming out of the international break, and if Arsenal are not at the races then Fulham are going to to cause them more problems this time.\nI actually think the Gunners will find a way to win this one, though. \nBukayo Saka's return after more than three months out will lift Emirates Stadium even if he starts the game on the bench and, if they need it, he will supply a spark whenever he gets on the pitch.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nLiam's prediction: Arsenal will get this done. 2-0\nMolineux, 19:45 BST\nWolves have got a nine-point cushion above the bottom three but they still have a bit of work to do to make sure they are completely safe. \nTheir best player Matheus Cunha is still suspended, and he is such a big miss. His recent comments about wanting to leave to win trophies are hardly much help to them either.\nWest Ham are only one place above Wolves, but are another eight points clear.\nTheir results have not been spectacular under Graham Potter but when I look at them, I do think they are improving - they came very close to beating Everton last time out, and actually deserved the three points there.\nI'd like to pick a winner but I am not sure that will get me anywhere - this game smells of a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nLiam's prediction: I wasn't sure about this one, but I think Wolves might edge it with them being at home. 2-1\nCity Ground, 20:00 BST\nI am concerned how Nottingham Forest will cope without Chris Wood up front if he is out injured. At the moment it is not clear how serious his problem is.\nForest made quite a few changes against Brighton in the FA Cup over the weekend, and still got through without 'the Wood-chopper', but they really need him back as soon as possible.\nSpeaking as a Forest fan, it's especially annoying that he has picked up this injury while on international duty. \nNew Zealand have got an excellent cricket and rugby union team and I wish them every success at football, but do they really need Wood to get through their World Cup qualification campaign against the likes of Fiji and New Caledonia?\nI'd argue they don't need him, and that Wood is better than that. If I was from New Zealand, I'd probably have won about 700 caps, and there are greater priorities for Wood, which are to win the FA Cup and get Forest into next season's Champions League.\nIt will be harder for Forest without him, but I still think they can repeat their win at Old Trafford in December.\nSaturday's FA Cup win over Brighton was not exactly a thriller, but as we have seen plenty of times from Forest already this season, they are not here to entertain - they are here to get the job done.\nAs for Manchester United, it is a big end to the season for their boss Ruben Amorim.\nBruno Fernandes has carried them a bit recently in the league, and he is their best hope of getting a positive result here. \nI am not sure either side will be too bothered about having the ball, but Forest fans are happy for them to sit deep and play on the counter, even when they are at home, and they are really good at it.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nLiam's prediction: There are going to be goals in this one, because United always seem to get a goal from somewhere. I am going to go with Forest to win whether Wood is fit or not. 3-1\nVitality Stadium, 19:45 BST\nBournemouth have lost a bit of form of late, going out of the FA Cup and taking only one point from their past four league games.\nThey really need a positive result to get back on track, so who better to face than an Ipswich team who are struggling badly?\nI thought Bournemouth played well in the first half against Manchester City on Sunday and carried a goal threat - but the mindset of the Ipswich players is likely to be a bigger factor in what happens in this game.\nThe bottom three are doing so badly that we maybe should have relegated them over the international break - it feels like all three of them need a miracle if they are going to survive from here.\nAs I've said many times, I actually like the Ipswich model and how they play, and I am a fan of Kieran McKenna as a manager.\nI have felt for them this season and, out of the bottom three sides, they have given it the best go at staying up, but it is quite a damning statistic that they are the only side in the top five tiers of English football yet to win a league game in 2025.\nMaybe the international break will have done them good but this feels like an open goal for Bournemouth, who are still right in the race for Champions League football next season.\nThe Cherries needed two late goals to win at Portman Road before Christmas but I am not sure McKenna's side will put up the same fight this time. \nIt is starting to feel like they are resigned to their fate, and they might have to think about how they will bounce back next season - if they can keep their squad together then I'd be confident that will happen.\nThere will be suitors for Liam Delap, of course, but if he wanted to move somewhere nice he could just come and live in Norwich - it is quite a long drive to Ipswich though.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nLiam's prediction: Bournemouth will be too strong. 2-0\nAmex Stadium, 19:45 BST\nWhat a season Aston Villa are having, with a Champions League quarter-final and FA Cup semi-final to look forward to.\nTheir recruitment in January has been key - a lot has been made of how well Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio are playing after joining on loan, and rightly so.\nWhether Villa can turn them into permanent signings in the summer might depend on whether they get in next season's Champions League, however.\nWhile this is exactly the scenario they want, finishing in the top five is going to be tough on top of everything else and it is games like this where everything might catch up with them. \nBrighton drew a blank against Forest in the FA Cup on Saturday but Villa are a bit more expansive, and I feel like the Seagulls will have plenty of chances here.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nLiam's prediction: Villa are very strong but Brighton are decent at home. 1-1\nEtihad Stadium, 19:45 BST\nWhat a gimme this game is for Manchester City.\nIt is exactly the fixture they would want after their FA Cup win at Bournemouth, when Pep Guardiola was speaking about his players showing heart and soul, and the desire and passion that they need.\nThe way he was talking shows how much winning the FA Cup means to him, but does it mean they are back on track? I am not sure, and I don't think this game will tell us much either because they should blow Leicester away even if they are nowhere near their best.\nLeicester have not scored a league goal since the end of January, and I don't see that changing at Etihad Stadium. They are at the stage where their fans cheer a corner, let alone a shot at goal - that's desperate, and that's where Leicester are at.\nFrom what Pep was saying, he knows how important this game is for their run-in, as Manchester City look to secure Champions League football next season. I don't think there is any chance they will slip up.\nSutton's prediction: 5-0\nLiam's prediction: Manchester City to win this all the way. I am not sure Ruud van Nistelrooy was the right appointment for Leicester - I've seen a lot of stuff on social media with people saying 'Ruud out, Dyche in'. I'm not sure if that will happen but I think he would do a good job there. 3-0\nSt James' Park, 19:45 BST\nHave Newcastle stopped celebrating yet? They have been on the lash for a long time after winning the Carabao Cup, culminating - for some of their fans anyway - with their trophy parade on Saturday. I am sure the players have sunk a few too.\nIt showed how much the club's success means to the city, but now they have to focus on the rest of the season, because getting back into the Champions League would be massive for what comes next for Eddie Howe's side, and how they are viewed across Europe.\nThere will be a fantastic atmosphere at this game too, but the danger with that is we know Brentford are capable of spoiling anyone's party with their attacking threat.\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe has tried to address that, by speaking about the need to finish the campaign strongly, and this is a great example of where his side cannot afford to take their eye off the ball.\nI suspect they will come out of the traps very quickly against Brentford, lifted by the crowd, and go a couple of goals up before the weekend starts to take its toll on them and the fans too.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nLiam's prediction: Brentford are a dangerous team but I just feel like Newcastle will still be on that high off the back of winning the Carabao Cup. 2-1\nSt Mary's Stadium, 19:45 BST\nI've been speaking about some teams like Aston Villa and Newcastle who have got a lot to play for this season, but none of that applies to Southampton.\nSaints' sole aim now is to pick up three more points and avoid going down with the lowest points tally in Premier League history.\nWhat a depressing place to be for Southampton fans - only possibly saving some face by beating Derby County's pathetic points total of 11 points from 2007-08, when Robbie Savage was captain.\nSouthampton took the lead when they played Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in December, although they still lost.\nI don't see the Eagles having any problems this time, though. Eberechi Eze is on fire for club and country and Ismaila Sarr found the target again in Saturday's FA Cup win over Fulham.\nSarr has gone under the radar a bit but he is one of many Palace players to have hit form, and I don't see Southampton keeping them out.\nSutton's prediction: 0-2\nLiam's prediction: I am going with Palace here, they have got all the momentum. 0-1\nAnfield, 19:45 BST\nLiverpool have had a break since going out of the Champions League and losing the Carabao Cup final, and I don't think we will see them wobble here. Quite the opposite in fact, now their focus is just on the Premier League.\nThe Reds also felt wronged by Everton's late equaliser at Goodison Park in February so there will be all of that bubbling under, and Arne Slot's side will feel they have a point to prove.\nThey are going to put Everton under all sorts of pressure, but the Toffees will be well organised defensively and have an eye on a counter-attack too.\nEverton boss David Moyes has transformed a team that was lacking belief, and he would love nothing more than to go to Anfield and get something.\nI am expecting a typical derby, in that I would not be surprised if this is another emotional game as well as an explosive one, with maybe a couple of players losing their heads.\nThere will be plenty of drama along the way, but I am pretty sure Liverpool will be back to their best form and end up taking the three points.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nLiam's prediction: There might be a bit of tension from the Liverpool fans off the back of their two massive defeats and with the rumours about Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk both leaving. I think Arne Slot has still got everything under control in terms of them winning the Premier League, but if there is any kind of hangover from losing at Wembley and going out of Europe, it will help us. \nSo, obviously being the optimistic Everton fan that I am, I am going to go for the same result we got at Goodison. The form we have been in lately, I think Moyes will have us right up for it and believing we can get something. \nWhat was hilarious about our 2-2 draw in February is that I was one of many fans who had left the ground during stoppage time. I was walking down Goodison Road and next minute it was like there was an eruption. There were people running down the street to see what had happened - we all ran down to the Royal Oak pub which is on the corner, and looked through the windows to find out Tarkowski had scored. It was incredible! 1-1\nThis video can not be played\nThe best ground in the Premier League - Everton fans react to new stadium\nLiam on Everton's stadium move: I have not actually been to the new ground yet, purposely, because I want to see it in full flow, at our first home game of next season - I can't wait.\nI will miss Goodison Park, of course, because of the amount of history there - it even smells of football - but unfortunately football is a business and the club needs to evolve and make more money. \nSo, this move is needed, but it is exciting too - it's a new era for us and, from what I've seen and been told, I think it is going to be quite an intimidating stadium for away teams, because of the steepness of the stands - the gradient is twice as steep as the Kop at Anfield - but it is probably going to take time for us to settle in and get the atmosphere going.\nStamford Bridge, 20:00 BST\nThis is a great game to finish the week off. It ended up 4-3 to Chelsea earlier in the season, and there are likely to be a few more goals this time too.\nChelsea have people like Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson and Noni Madueke back from injury to bolster their attack, but Spurs have got some key players like Micky van de Ven fit again too.\nTottenham's league campaign has been disappointing - it is winning the Europa League or bust for them - while Chelsea are still chasing the Champions League places.\nSpurs looked tired to me before the international break, so it will be interesting to see what they are like here. We know how exciting they can be on their day, it is just those days have been few and far between this season.\nChelsea have been a bit flat as well, but maybe this is the game where both teams come to life and serve up a thriller - that is what I am hoping for anyway.\nSutton's prediction: 3-2\nLiam's prediction: I am tempted to say this will be high-scoring but I am going to be conservative. 2-1\nChris was right about two of the four FA Cup quarter-final ties - he did not think his boyhood side Nottingham Forest would beat Brighton and was wrong about Fulham beating Crystal Palace too.\nYou lot did even worse, and wrongly thought Bournemouth would get past Manchester City, meaning the only prediction you got right was for Aston Villa to beat Preston.\nThe winner was Chris's guest, DJ Nathan Dawe. He was right about his team, Villa, and correctly backed City and Palace too.\nThere were eight Premier League games played in week 29, the last set of fixtures before the international break.\nSo far, Chris and his guest, Divorce singer Felix, have both got four correct results, with one exact score, giving them both 70 points.\nFor now, it goes down as a win for the BBC readers - using the most popular scoreline from your predictions for each game, you got five correct results, with one exact scores, leaving them on 80 points.\nThe remaining two games were rearranged because of the Carabao Cup final. \nNo-one picked up any points from Liverpool's draw with Aston Villa, which was moved forward to 19 February, so the weekly winner will be decided when Newcastle host Crystal Palace on 16 April - Felix has gone for a 2-1 Palace win.",

        "article_text": "England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson will again caddie for Lottie Woad at the Augusta National Women's Amateur tournament\nIt was while standing on the 12th tee at Augusta National that Lottie Woad had one of those 'pinch me' moments.\nThe English amateur, from Farnham in Surrey, was seven holes away from securing a career highlight win that would kick-start a stellar 2024.\nIt was a year that started with her becoming the first European to claim the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA) title at the home of the Masters - a title she will try to become the first to defend this week when the three-day competition starts on Wednesday.\nIt was a year in which the England Golf women's squad member played in her first majors, finished as top Briton at the Women's Open, helped win the Curtis Cup, and ended it as the world's number-one-ranked amateur.\n\"It was definitely a breakthrough year,\" the 21-year-old tells BBC Sport. \"Winning at Augusta was the highlight and that kicked off the whole year.\"\n\"I have respect for everyone playing the 12th hole because it looks bigger than it actually is, but there is not much room. It's probably like 20 feet deep max.\"\nAnd it was on the back nine at Augusta - where so many Masters dreams have flourished and floundered - that Woad managed to keep her nerve.\nThe 12th was among the pivotal holes and she had to steady herself to tackle one of the most daunting par-threes in golf.\nDozens of rounds have been ruined on this most picturesque of holes. Tiger Woods hit three balls in Rae's Creek, the water that protects the front of the green, on his way to a 10 in 2020, the year after he won his fifth Green Jacket.\n\"You're standing on the tee and you're just like, 'I'm on hole 12',\" she says.\n\"You're nervous but then you're also going 'I'm playing the 12th at Augusta', so it's not too bad.\"\nWoad, who went into the final round of the 54-hole event - of which the first 36 are played at the nearby Champions Retreat Golf Club - with a two-shot lead, marked a three on her card to stay at six under. \nBut up ahead American Bailey Shoemaker was putting the finishing touches to the first bogey-free round at Augusta in the five-year history of the ANWA. A sensational 66 set a target of seven under.\nA bogey on the par-five 13th meant Woad dropped two behind, but she produced a magical finish with three birdies in her final four holes to snatch victory on the final green.\nThe putt on the 18th was an 18-footer, downhill.\n\"It didn't have much break but it was pretty quick,\" she says.\n\"Then it went in and I've won at Augusta and everyone kind of went crazy.\"\nWoad's season was about to get a little more crazy. The victory opened the door to play the majors, the Chevron Championship two weeks later being the first.\nShe spent a hectic week catching up with friends and college work at Florida State University, where she is in the penultimate year of a sports management degree, before heading to Texas.\n\"My parents and coaches were at Augusta and they wanted to go home, so I was left on my own at my first major,\" she says.\n\"I had to get a local caddie, but I had a lot of confidence from Augusta, made the cut and was in contention.\" \nWoad finished joint 23rd, alongside England's Georgia Hall and Charley Hull, two of her \"favourite players\" that she had \"looked up to\" since concentrating on the sport from about the age of 13.\nShe had taken her first lessons, aged seven, with Farnham pro Luke Bone, who remains her coach.\nProgression to the England Girls followed by the age of 15 and, while perhaps not seen as the most naturally gifted golfer, Woad's work ethic impressed as she took advantage of resources not previously available to her.\n\"I had a putting coach, a strength and conditioning coach and a psychologist,\" she says.\n\"I was always pretty good at the long game, but I had to work a lot harder on my short game and I learned how to practise more effectively.\"\nShe went on to win the prestigious Girls Amateur Championship at Carnoustie in 2022, a decade after Hall triumphed in the event.\nWoad was back in Scotland for last year's Women's Open, which was held over the Old Course in St Andrews.\nShe had missed the cut at the US Women's Open and Evian Championship but arrived in Fife in buoyant mood for her fourth major.\nWoad would be in contention all week and finish joint 10th to win the Smyth Salver as the highest-placed amateur, with another highlight being a 60-yard chip-in eagle two on the par-four last in round three.\n\"That got me back into the top 10 going into final day. It was a really cool moment with the grandstand full of cheering people,\" she says.\n\"Then at the prize-giving I get to stand next to the winner, Lydia Ko. To see her lift that trophy motivates you.\n\"It was a perfect week. Home of golf, first Open - I couldn't have dreamed it better.\"\nThere was little time for celebration, though. The Curtis Cup, which pits Great Britain and Ireland's top female amateurs against their American counterparts, was the following week.\nThe Americans were favourites to win a fourth successive title after domineering victories in the previous three editions of the biennial event.\nBut GB&I were boosted by having Europe's victorious Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew as their leader.\nAnd Woad, who grew up 40 minutes from the Sunningdale Old Course that hosted the event, contributed 2\u00bd points in a nerve-shredding 10\u00bd-9\u00bd triumph.\nBy that point, Woad had ascended to top of the amateur rankings, which earned her the Mark H McCormack medal. Ko won the prize three successive times from its inception in 2011, while Ireland's Leona Maguire and rising US star Rose Zhang are also three-time recipients.\nSo what does 2025 hold for Woad?\nThe 'P' word is unavoidable, even if Woad will \"only be making that decision when I get to it\".\nTurning professional would appear to be the next logical step and Woad is on an LPGA pathway that could help accelerate that process.\n\"You can get an LPGA card when you reach 20 points and I'm currently on 16,\" she says. \"I'm trying to get 20 points this year and then we'll have a decision to make.\n\"If you make a cut in a major you get a point. If you get a top-25 finish you get a point. If you win Augusta or NCAAs (National Collegiate Athletic Associations), you get two points.\n\"I'm trying to not think too much about it. But if I play well I'm going to get those points.\"\nThe NCAAs are the pinnacle of collegiate golf in the US, pitting teams and individuals against each other. Woad finished runner-up in the individual competition last year, while her university team were joint 11th.\nThis season, Woad has posted an impressive eight consecutive top-three finishes since September. But her Florida State team-mate, 19-year-old Malaysian Mirabel Ting, has eclipsed that, winning six events since last year's AWNA to lead the NCAA individual rankings.\nJasmine Koo is also in a field which boasts 49 of the top 50 in the world. Over the past 12 months the number two ranked player has had four wins and seven top-five finishes.\nAnd 16-year-old Asterisk Talley is tipped to feature again. She finished joint eighth last year and went on to beat Woad in the singles at the Curtis Cup as she also enjoyed a superb 2024.\nHowever, Woad goes into the week knowing that she has conquered Augusta National before and she will again have England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson on the bag.\n\"That's going to be nice, to have that familiarity,\" she says. \"I'm just really excited. It's going to be a fun week, and hopefully I can be the first to defend the title.\"",

She finished joint eighth last year and went on to beat Woad in the singles at the Curtis Cup as she also enjoyed a superb 2024.However, Woad goes into the week knowing that she has conquered Augusta National before and she will again have England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson on the bag. \"I'm trying to get 20 points this year and then we'll have a decision to make.

It's just the most phenomenal dream come true.\"\nSouth Africa is the continent's second-most successful nation at the summer Olympics with 28 gold medals but, given its warm climate, it is yet to make a real impact at the Winter Games.\nThe country did not send anyone to the Sochi 2014 or Beijing 2022 Games, and Smith is set to be just the 16th South African to represent his country at the event.\n\"I just love putting South Africa on the map in a winter sport,\" he said.\n\"I'm not the first. I definitely won't be the last.\n\"We have heart, courage and determination as a nation. All these South African athletes who precede me have been champions.\"\nSmith has amassed more than 10,000 followers on Instagram by giving updates on his journey in cross-country skiing\nShortly after his move to the Norwegian capital Oslo, Smith's passion for the outdoors piqued an interest in skiing.\n\"I loved to run, cycle, swim outside, and then I moved to Norway as the snow was falling and the winter was coming,\" he explained.\n\"I thought to myself, I have two options here: either I lean into this or I hibernate.\"\nSmith chose to embrace the conditions in Scandinavia and, as fate would have it, his new hobby led to him meeting Allan Corona, a Mexican cross-country skier.\nThe two men have since formed a close bond, becoming training partners and also competing alongside one another on the international circuit.\n\"I just decided to take the bull by the horns,\" Smith said.\n\"If Allan can represent Mexico, why can't I represent South Africa?\"\nThen came bigger questions and an ambitious target.\n\"When's the next Olympics?\" Smith continued. \"Do we have anyone representing us? No.\n\"Is it humanly possible to qualify in two years' time and represent your country in three? I proved that it is.\"\nSmith secured South Africa a spot at Milan-Cortina at the Nordic World Ski Championships in Trondheim at the end of February.\nA 38th-placed finish in a 7.5km race - some 10 seconds behind Corona - earned him enough ranking points from the world governing body to achieve a dream which appeared unlikely when he took up the sport.\nSmith first took part in a competition sanctioned by the sport's world governing body in March 2023\nWith cross-country skiing dominated by traditional and well-resourced powerhouses such as Norway and Sweden, Smith has found support from fellow non-traditional winter sports nations.\nA sense of community has been fostered between athletes from those countries, especially via a WhatApp group called 'Team Avalanche' set up by Trinidad and Tobago's Nick Lau.\n\"It is 54 athletes from [the likes of] Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and we share resources,\" Smith said.\n\"We share beds, sofas, wax, skis.\n\"It's become a large community of nations that support each other. I'd argue that we have a stronger support community than the big nations.\n\"It's nice to see some flavour, some variety, in the sport. It might be a Nordic sport, but the global south is rising and it is becoming very much a global sport.\"\nWith his fiancee expecting to give birth to the couple's first child this year, Smith will have to manage his time wisely as he prepares for the Winter Olympics, which will take place in February next year.\n\"I've got the points I need to qualify. The comfort that I have now is I can go into the summer without stress,\" he said.\n\"I will hopefully have a month or two off where my son is born over summer, which is usually a quieter period.\n\"I will try to maintain my training - what my son will allow - to get away for an hour or two here and there. I might have to do a lot of training on the bike at home.\n\"The plan is to enjoy summer, become a father and whatever that throws me.\"\nThe prospect of being South Africa's flagbearer at the Winter Olympics is something that excites Smith, though he is hopeful that others from the country could join him in Italy.\n\"There are currently five active South African athletes in five different disciplines,\" he said.\n\"I very much hope we all qualify, because it would be the largest team we will have ever sent to a [Winter] Games.\n\"I would love to carry the flag but I think the greatest honour is being there and achieving a childhood dream of representing my country in a sport.\n\"It was the Springboks. I'll take the Snowbok.\"",

        "article_text": "The prime minister has told the makers of hit Netflix drama Adolescence that it was \"really hard to watch\" with his teenage children, as he hosted a Downing Street meeting to discuss the influence of toxic material online.\nSir Keir Starmer said the show, about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl from his class, served as \"a torch that shines intensely brightly on a combination of issues that many people don't know how to respond to\".\nBut he warned there was not a \"silver bullet response\" or \"some policy lever that can be pulled\".\nSir Keir also welcomed a move by Netflix to make the series available to screen for free in secondary schools.\nThe programme has sparked a national conversation about the impact of social media and \"manosphere\" influencers.\nJack Thorne, who wrote the show with actor Stephen Graham, recently said the prime minister should \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.\nThorne and producer Jo Johnson gave their views to Sir Keir at Monday's meeting, along with charities including the NSPCC and Children's Society, and young people. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy was also there.\nThe prime minister told them the show was \"at times harrowing\" but had \"lit a touch paper\" under the debate about the issues.\n\"We've been watching with our children - my boy is 16, my girl is 14 - and I have to say, I found it really hard,\" he told BBC political editor Chris Mason.\nIt was so arresting, he said, because \"in a sense, what happens in the drama could really happen anywhere, and almost happen to any child\".\nIt shone a light \"on misogyny, on online content, and this sense of children, particularly boys, getting drawn in to this world\", he said.\nBut unlike some things the government deals with, \"there isn't an obvious policy response which will answer all of these questions\", he added.\n\"It's much broader than that. It's a cultural issue, and therefore we're going to have to look more broadly, work as a society on this, and discuss it, which is why I'm really pleased that Adolescence is now going to be shown in schools free because I do think young people should be watching it.\"\nNetflix announced that the drama would be available to all UK secondary schools through the Into Film+ schools streaming service.\nAsked about banning phones in schools, which has also been proposed by the Conservative opposition, he said 97% of schools were already doing that - so it was \"not, to my mind, the central issue\".\n\"If we're going to get to grips with this, I personally would much rather we focus on what I think is the real issue, which is, whether you're at school or elsewhere, what are you actually accessing? Because that, for me, is the critical issue,\" he said.\n\"And whether it's at school or elsewhere, there's material that clearly shouldn't be accessed.\"\nThe government has pointed to measures including the Online Safety Act, which says social media companies will have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.\nPlatforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.\nSir Keir said it was \"an important piece of legislation\", but that \"we should go back and revisit whether there's further work that we need to do to protect young people\".\nThe PM also denied a suggestion that showing the programme in schools would demonise boys who spend a lot of time online but haven't ended up like Jamie in Adolescence.\n\"I think it's probably wrong to think that there's just a group of boys that are drawn to this [material],\" he told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat.\n\"Certainly, there's a group that are drawn to the extreme edges of this, and we see that in the drama, of course, but I think many boys would be somewhere, possibly, on a continuum here.\"\nThe government is also updating its guidance on how schools should teach children about relationships, sex and health education (RSHE).\nThe Times recently reported that it would include \"lessons to counter misogyny and the growing appeal of influencers such as Andrew Tate\", in the wake of the discussions about Adolescence.\nSpeaking afterwards, Thorne said it was a \"brilliant\" meeting.\n\"The brilliant thing was that it wasn't about us,\" he said. \"It was about facilitating conversations with charities and youth groups who really understand what's going on, and I hope a solution can be found to this problem.\"\nThe success of Adolescence has helped those charities and groups get \"the opportunity to have conversations that they haven't had before and that they should have had, and that might lead to a policy change and things being made better for our young people\", he added.\nBy Pria Rai and Riyah Collins, BBC Newsbeat\nFor 22-year-old Harry Foster, being radicalised as a teenager was \"very easy\".\n\"When you're a child, it's very easy when there's a lack of any sort of direction or positive role models to get swept along with something,\" he said.\nHe said extremist groups exploited his vulnerability with addiction issues as a teenager, manipulating him into sharing racist and misogynistic views.\n\"I thought I was finding some sense of belonging,\" he told Newsbeat. \"What I was actually being given was a very harmful and very radical set of political views, which is almost like the trade-off for belonging to these people.\"\nHe got help through The Warren youth group in Hull and now works with them to help other boys and young men in similar situations.\nHarry welcomed Sir Keir's plans to work with Netflix to show Adolescence in secondary schools, but said more work must be done.\n\"I don't think there's ever been a time where young people as a whole feel more disconnected from politicians,\" he said.\n\"It's one thing to make young men aware of the problems around these kind of ideologies, but it's equally important we're offering an alternative to young boys and men who are so desperately looking for something to identify with.\n\"I don't think it's as simple as showing a TV show. There needs to be a positive alternative for young people.\"",

He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.\nThe Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March air raids.\nIn the wake of the controversy, Waltz said he took full responsibility for the group chat. \"I built the group,\" he told Fox News on Tuesday, adding it was \"embarrassing\".\nWaltz was unable to explain in his Fox News interview how Goldberg came to be on the chat but said another, unnamed contact of his was supposed to be there in Goldberg's place.\n\"I can tell you for 100% I don't know this guy,\" Waltz said.\nOn Sunday, Goldberg said on NBC's Meet the Press that Waltz is \"telling everyone that he's never met me or spoken to me - that's simply not true\".\nPresident Trump called the incident a \"glitch\" and said that it had \"no impact at all\" operationally, adding that the military strike against the Houthis was a success.\nBut former national security officials have raised concerns that allowing this to slide could pose major risks and encourage American adversaries.\nSue Gordon, a former Trump administration deputy director of national intelligence, told BBC's US partner CBS News that she was \"glad the operation was successful. Now we need to deal with the fact that this should not have happened\".\n\"I don't think we should rest on the fact that nothing bad happened this time,\" she said. \"We don't know whether that communications path has been penetrated. So we don't know whether the state actors that have lots of resources are just sitting and working now.\"\nThose concerns have led many Democrats to call for greater accountability, with Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asserting that if a military officer or CIA agent treated classified information in a similar manner they \"would be fired - end of story\".\n\"I believe Secretary Hegseth should resign or be fired. I think Mike Waltz should resign or be fired,\" Warner told CBS News on Sunday. \"If no action is taken, what message does that send to the workforce?\" \nStill, in an interview with NBC News on Saturday, Trump said he would not fire anyone involved in the group chat, and that he still had confidence in Waltz.\n\"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" he said.\nAlong with Waltz and Hegseth, the chat also included Vice-President JD Vance, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other senior leaders.

They were between the ages of 18 and 30 when they say the abuse occurred.\nThe Fladgate law firm, which represents the estate, has been contacted for comment.\nLeigh Day, the law firm representing the alleged victims, say the women were subjected to \"serious sexual abuse, harassment and mistreatment\". \nSome allege they were threatened when they tried to raise concerns or report the abuse.\nPrevious claims have been brought against Harrods, the department store owned by Al Fayed until 2010. \nRichard Meeran, one of the partners working on the women's case, told the BBC: \"It is important that his estate is also made legally accountable for the widespread abuse he perpetrated against those who may never have had dealings with the famous store.\"\nThe women are pursuing compensation under a personal injury claim.

A spokesperson for Mr Fayed, who lives in the US, said previously that he unequivocally denied any and all the allegations of wrongdoing, adding that \"the incidents simply never took place\".\nHarrods' new owners have previously said they are \"appalled\" by the allegations of sexual abuse and have been investigating since 2023 whether any current members of staff were involved.\nIn November, the Met said it was investigating at least five people it believes may have assisted or enabled Al Fayed's alleged sexual offences.\nIf you have information about this story that you would like to share please get in touch. \nEmail MAFinvestigation@bbc.co.uk.

        "article_text": "Jon Hamm excels in Apple TV+'s \"emotionally real but absurdist\" drama about a desperate corporate man who resorts to stealing from his neighbours.\nJon Hamm has his best role since Mad Men and brings all his sharp comic timing and dramatic nuance to it as Andrew Cooper, known as Coop, a hedge-fund manager who loses his job and manoeuvres to maintain his elaborate lifestyle and sense of himself. If you took Don Draper and dropped him into 2025 he might be Coop, a corporate man with a broken marriage and two teenaged children, a decent guy and a charmer with all-around bad judgement. Your Friends and Neighbors is emotionally real and affecting but also absurdist and funny, a rare combination.\nThe show begins with Coop waking up in a pool of blood next to a man's dead body in the foyer of a neighbour's mansion. He cleans up the blood \u2013 a bad move \u2013 and in one of the many mordant voiceovers that run through the series, looks back four months to reflect on \"the swirling hot mess of my life\". His worst choice is replacing his lost income by stealing loot from friends so rich they'll never miss it. The robberies are the comic vein in the story, but also a Trojan horse for its drama. Coop is hurt and distraught over the loss of his marriage, but that theme exists next to the caper-like thefts. The series is edgier and smarter than its entertaining surface suggests, as it deftly takes on issues of family, class privilege, vapid materialism and toxic masculinity.\nLike most series, this could start a bit faster, as it sets up the life Coop is accustomed to in a suburban New York community of huge houses and country clubs, where $200,000 cars and $60,000 donations to charity are ordinary. That was his life until he found his wife Mel (Amanda Peet) in bed with his so-called friend, Nick (Mark Tallman), a former basketball star still in great shape. The divorce has sent Coop out of his expansive home into a smaller rental house nearby.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 11 of the best TV shows to watch this April\n\u2022 A new Hollywood take-down is a must-see\n\u2022 Why on-screen male nudity is still taboo\nBut soon enough the first episode gets to its boldest turn as we see why Coop lost his job. A woman who works at his firm, whom he has never met and who doesn't report to him, comes on to him in a bar. Months later, that consensual hookup leads to his being fired for violating the company's HR rules. Pop culture has at times gingerly dipped a toe into the theme of sexual harassment. On The Morning Show, Steve Carell's character, a toxic predator, was sent off a cliff to die. But there has been nothing as complicated as this. The show doesn't deny Coop's bad judgement but also makes it clear through the woman herself and Coop's ruthless boss that the HR rule was a convenient excuse to get rid of him while keeping his clients. The show doesn't go far beyond that in exploring the issue, but it sets up the series' complex realism about social standards.\u00a0\nA non-compete clause makes Coop unhireable, but he insists on keeping up appearances. His burglaries are treated like adventures, punctuated by mock ads as he describes the luxury items he's lifting, with voiceovers that slyly echo Hamm's in all those Mercedes-Benz commercials. \"The Patek Phillippe Nautilus: sealed 18-carat white gold...\" Coop says, talking about an item no one really needs.\nThe series' real strength, though, is in his relationships, most of them driven by his wounded pride, and the way his identity has been tied to his role as a successful man of the world. Hamm smoothly navigates the shifts in tone, never allowing the humour to flag while letting us see the emotional pain Coop won't reveal to anyone around him. There is a lot of residual affection between Coop and his cheating ex-wife, whom Peet manages to make sympathetic. When Mel worries and asks him what's wrong, he displays a classic alpha-male inability to share feelings. \"I'm fine,\" he tells her when clearly he is not. Olivia Munn has less to do as Sam, a divorced neighbour and Coop's occasional fling. And Lena Hall is brilliant as Coop's sister, Ali. Briefly off her meds, she stalks her ex-fianc\u00e9, sitting on his lawn with her guitar and singing. Hall, who won a Tony for her role in the Broadway revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch in 2014, sings occasionally through the series \u2013 an asset, not an intrusion. She makes Ali empathetic, funny and warm, and the bond between the brother and sister is touching. After she is back on her meds, her romantic subplot suggests that theirs really is a family full of bad choices.\nA second season of the show has already been ordered, so the question of whether Coop will pay for his crimes will linger. That plot is an effective hook, but his resonant feelings and increasing self-knowledge set the show apart. At a party of male friends hosted by Nick \u2013 why is Coop even there? more bad choices \u2013 he looks around at the men who still have their jobs and money, and sees the person he might have become. \"Their future was already written, and so the quest to stave off the emptiness began,\" he says in voiceover, observing their devotion to \"Scotch and cigars\", to \"custom golf clubs and high-end escorts\". He recognises that there are \"entire industries built to cash in on the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men\".

        "article_text": "In Jordan, a 50km pilgrimage trail follows the path of a 4th-Century nun who journeyed through the Holy Land \u2013 centuries before Spain's famed Camino de Santiago.\nThe hike begins early in the morning at Mount Nebo, a sacred mountain 610m above sea level in Jordan. On a clear day, panoramic views of the Dead Sea, Bethlehem and Jerusalem stretch across the horizon. According to the Bible, it is the last place Moses gazed upon before his death. Today, it's the first sight walkers see as they set out on their journey along the Camino de Egeria, a pilgrim route first taken by a 4th-Century nun.\u00a0\nThe view is \"magical\", says Silvano Mezzenzana, who recently undertook the three-day hike. He recalls standing atop that peak on the Moab plateau, a dry Sun fanning out over the ridges and farmland beneath, noting that it is fascinating both in the morning when the Sun lights up the Palestinian bank and the city of Jericho, and in the afternoon when the sunset draws the silhouettes of the hills of Judah up to Jerusalem. Up there, \"you do not realise that you are on a mountain\", he adds.\u00a0\nBeginning on the eastern edge of the Great Rift Valley, the 50km route winds through farmland and rugged hills \u2013 a voyage that is far greener than its European equivalent, the 800km Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail undertaken by around 500,000 people each year. Following the January announcement from Jordan and Spain of a merger twinning the Camino de Egeria with the Camino de Santiago to boost their respective cultural heritage, locals hope that the newly-renovated Middle Eastern trail can become a similar phenomenon. The goal is to highlight the significance of the eponymous Egeria, the Spanish nun believed to have travelled by donkey from Jordan through Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Asia Minor to visit the holy places recounted in the Bible. She is thought to be the first woman to make the journey, which pre-dates the famed Camino de Santiago by five centuries.\u00a0\nThe hike is typically split up into three days (though can be done as quickly as in two, or a leisurely five). The terrain is not particularly challenging, but the distance \u2013 of around 17km per day \u2013 makes the hike unsuitable for total novices.\u00a0Last year, wide paths were fixed between the rocky valleys and hills along much of the route, ushering in what the Ministry of Tourism hopes will mark a new era for international interest in the country.\u00a0\nThe effort is already seeing results. \"Although I have lived in Jordan all my life, walking this trail has shown me parts of the country I've never experienced before,\" says Nadeen Dabbas. She recalls the flow of the water at the Moses Springs and the Jordan Valley, where she was surrounded by fields of bananas and corn, as moments that \"made me feel alive\".\nThe Best of 2025\nJordan was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good.\u00a0See the full list here.\nThe first major landmark on day one features a small monastery built by Egyptian monks in Moses' memory, built in the latter half of the 4th Century, enlarged a century later and rebuilt in the 6th Century to a mosaic-filled basilica that still stands today. The trail then passes through the ancient city of Livias, before reaching its showpiece on day two: Al-Maghatas, or Bethany beyond the Jordan. A Unesco World Heritage site, this is believed to be the location where Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist. Pilgrims can explore Byzantine and Roman remains of chapels, churches and monasteries, along with the cave of John the Baptist, and even \"spend the second night there in one of the pilgrim houses of Bethany, just next to the Jordan River\", explains Oscar Koshebye, a guide who helped formalise the current tourist trail. The route finishes here, or at the King Hussein Bridge at the Jordan-Israel border.\nWhile the hike offers striking natural beauty, the real draw may prove to be the woman who likely inspired it. \"Egeria's account is significant because it is one of the oldest written accounts of pilgrimage to the Holy Land that has survived \u2013 and the first incontrovertibly penned by a woman,\" says Anne McGowan, associate professor of liturgy at the Catholic Theological Union and co-author of Pilgrimage of Egeria. Egeria's work was little-known until the 1880s, McGowan adds, originally written in the form of letters to her \"sisters\" (likely holy women similar to herself). An incomplete manuscript dating to the 11th Century is currently the oldest known record of her route.\nEgeria travelled during the 4th Century, when many Christians took long-distance pilgrimages \u2013 something that fell out of favour from the 7th Century until around the mid-19th (aside from a \"blip\" in the wake of the Crusades, in the 12th-13th Centuries), McGowan explains. At that point, \"travel to the Holy Land became easier once again. Going on pilgrimage aligned well with the Romantic Era's renewed enthusiasm for the personal and the subjective on the one hand and an idealised past on the other; and Protestants as a group became more intrigued by pilgrimage possibilities connected to places associated with the life and death of Jesus in a way they hadn't been previously.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBut now, with religious appetite dwindling (a study published\u00a0last year\u00a0found that atheists now outnumber theists in the UK), Koshebye is hoping that a new generation can be drawn in. \"We can consider it now, after centuries of abandonment, a route for tolerance between faiths, a way to improve intercultural exchange,\" he says.\u00a0\nPlan your trip\nThe Egeria Way branch office is at the Kawon bookshop in Madaba. From here, registered visitors will be taken to trail's start point, 15km away in Mount Nebo. Packages from different tour operators will soon be offered by the Egeria Way Association. Travel within Jordan is safe, though the UK Foreign Office advises against travel within 3km of the border with Syria.\nThe Spanish national and keen hiker began mulling a walking route to Jerusalem five years ago. Having already walked the Spanish Camino, he mentioned his plans to his father, who likened his son's idea to the devout Egeria \u2013 who he had never heard of. Koshebye began reading about the nun and scouring old maps in search of her original route. He later made a YouTube video about his plans, was contacted by the Jordanian tourist board, and then got in touch with the Spanish embassy in Jordan \u2013 a series of collaborative efforts that led to the merger being born.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Wadi Rum Trail: Jordan's new long-distance hike\n\u2022 A new love for medieval-style travel\n\u2022 The pilgrimage sites of Iraq's timeless and holy cities\nKoshebye hopes that the partnership leads to a surge of interest in this three-day version of the hike and wants it to be extended a further 30km to Jerusalem, another stop on Egeria's route. Plans for signage along the Jordanian route and more guesthouses where walkers can rest in between are already afoot.\nWhile steeped in religious significance, ancient routes of this kind aren't just for those intent on retracing paths drawn by scripture, McGowan says. \"Taking a very long walk still has the capacity to pull one into an inner journey. Younger people are still spiritual seekers, even if their search is typically less closely tied to traditional religious beliefs and practices,\" she believes. \"Their pilgrimages might be more oriented toward the experience of journeying itself, as it seems Egeria's was as well; she does not so much set out on a round trip to visit one particular place, for example, as to experience as many places as possible.\"\nWith time \u2013 and a few more signposts \u2013 those involved in the project hope that Jordan's historic trail can achieve the same cultural significance as its Spanish counterpart. Mezzenzano, for one, has no doubt. \"I would not only recommend\" the trail, he enthuses, \"but I plan to repeat it\". \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "The US has been unable to meaningfully respond to the Myanmar earthquake due to the Trump administration's decision to slash foreign aid, according to three former senior US officials.\nOne former US Agency for International Development (USAID) mission director for Myanmar told the BBC that \"America has been on the sidelines\" after the disaster.\n\"The US basically was not there for the rescue-window period,\" said another official. All three suggested the deep cuts to aid probably cost lives.\nA 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, leaving at least 2,700 people dead, more than 4,500 injured and hundreds still missing, according to the country's military. Those figures are expected to rise.\nThe former USAID officials said the agency mobilised Disaster Assistance Response Teams (Darts) from the US after previous major earthquakes. Comprised of highly trained rescuers, sniffer dogs and specialist equipment, the teams are immediately made ready then dispatched when the affected country requests them.\nA typical deployment, like that sent to the Turkey-Syria earthquake in 2023, could comprise some 200 people - the majority of them rescue workers. US teams are often the biggest of all foreign assistance groups on the ground.\nThe US Department of State said on Monday a US team based in the region was on its way to Myanmar. It is believed to comprise three people who are advisers, not rescuers. \nThe state department also said it was donating $2m (\u00a31.6m) to humanitarian assistance organisations to support earthquake-affected communities. This figure is significantly smaller than previous US government donations during disasters, according to the former officials.\nPresident Donald Trump's adviser Elon Musk is finalising the shutdown of USAID after weeks spent dismantling the agency and placing staff on administrative leave. Trump targeted foreign assistance on his first day in office, calling it an \"industry\" that was in many cases \"antithetical to American values\".\nOn Friday, after the earthquake struck, the White House attempted to mobilise a Dart team, according to Andrew Natsios, who served as USAID administrator in George W Bush's administration. But, he said, it couldn't because key officials were on administrative leave.\n\"The problem is they fired most of the 500 people that make up the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, so obviously there are no people [from the bureau] to be on the Dart team to be sent - and the people have to be trained and be familiar with disaster relief operations,\" he said.\nStaff at the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance received letters of termination the day the earthquake struck, said Chris Milligan, who served as USAID Mission Director in Myanmar from 2012 to 2016.\n\"The employees\u2026 were told to go home by one o'clock. Everyone was told. All employees in that building were told to go home at one o'clock, and then they were told later to come back,\" said Mr Milligan.\n\"It shows the lack of management and the confusion that there was an earthquake earlier, and they didn't have the foresight to say 'Okay, let's retain these people'.\"\nTwo of the former USAID officials said the administration couldn't deploy US search and rescue teams, sniffer dogs and specialist equipment to Myanmar because logistics contracts to transport them from Virginia and California had been cancelled as part of the cuts, led by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).\n\"It is the first time that I can think of that the US has simply not responded meaningfully to a major disaster,\" said Jeremy Konyndyk, who ran the USAID Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) from 2013 to 2016.\nHe said for the last few decades, with every disaster on this scale, the US would be the largest and most capable team on the ground.\n\"You've got 75 to 100 people, the dogs and it's a pretty substantial lift [which] you've got to get there, operating and excavating piles, within the first really four days.\"\n\"The US basically was not there for the rescue window, period. And it's too late,\" said Mr Konyndyk.\nIt's unlikely the agency could reactivate logistics contracts in time for a Dart team to Myanmar in time to save lives, he said. \"If you wanted to issue new ones, the people who could issue new contracts and do the tenders for that, they've all been fired,\" explained Mr Konyndak.\nThe US state department rejects the notion that the cuts have impacted disaster relief in Myanmar.\nThe department had partners it worked with \"that may not require us to be physically present\", spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said on Monday.\n\"With the reform that the government is going through with the lead of President Trump\u2026 certain things won't necessarily look the same.  But the success in the work and our impact will still be there,\" she said.\nHowever, Mr Konyndyk described the claim as \"fantasy land\".\n\"You can't pull people out of a building virtually, you can't excavate, you can't do live rescues from a collapsed building without boots on the ground,\" he said.\nChris Milligan, the former USAID mission director for Myanmar, said the rescue capacity available in the United States would double the capacity already on the ground in Myanmar.\n\"This is the new normal. This is what it looks like when the United States sits on the international sidelines, when the United States is a weaker international player, when it cedes the space to other global players like China,\" said Mr Milligan.\nThe state department told the BBC it did not intend to deploy a Dart team to Myanmar, adding it was continuing many existing lifesaving programs and strategic investments that \"strengthen our partners and our own country\".\nA state department spokesperson said: \"USAID has contracts in place with Urban Search and Rescue Teams to assist in responding to disasters.\"\n\"[A] USAID team of humanitarian experts based in the region are traveling to Burma to assess additional needs,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\"A Dart is essentially a coordination mechanism. We are able to coordinate with our partners for this specific response without a Dart. Every response is different,\" added the spokesperson.\nAdditional reporting by Alex Lederman",

        "article_text": "Why won't India buy even a single bushel of American corn?\nThat's the question US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick raised recently while criticising India's trade policies, taking a swipe at its market restrictions.\nIn another interview, Lutnick accused India of blocking US farmers and urged it to open its agricultural market - suggesting quotas or limits as a possible approach.\nAgriculture is a key battleground in US President Donald Trump's escalating trade war, with tit-for-tat or reciprocal tariffs set to kick in on 2 April. \nTariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.\nFor years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.\nTo be sure, India's transformation from a food-deficient nation to a food-surplus powerhouse is one of its biggest success stories.\nIn the 1950s and '60s, the country relied on food aid to feed its population, but a series of agricultural breakthroughs changed that. India became self-sufficient in staples, and became the world's largest milk producer. Rapid growth in  horticulture, poultry and aquaculture expanded its food basket.\nToday, India is not just feeding its 1.4 billion people but, as the world's eighth-largest agri-produce exporter, also shipping grains, fruits and dairy worldwide.\nYet, despite such major gains, Indian agriculture still lags in productivity, infrastructure and market access. Global price volatility and climate change add to the challenge. Crop yields lag far behind the global best. Small landholdings worsen the problem - Indian farmers work with less than a hectare on average, while their American counterparts had over 46 hectares in 2020.\nNo surprise then that productivity remains low, even though farming remains India's backbone, supporting over 700 million people, nearly half the country's population. Agriculture employs nearly half of India's workforce but accounts for just 15% of GDP. In comparison, less than 2% of the US population depends on farming. With limited manufacturing jobs, more people are stuck in low-paying farm work, an unusual trend for a developing country.\nThis structural imbalance also shapes India's trade policies. Despite its farm surplus, India keeps tariffs high to shield its farmers from cheap imports. It maintains moderate to high tariffs - ranging from zero to 150% - on farm imports.\nThe weighted average tariff - the average duty rate per imported product - in India on US farm products is 37.7%, compared to 5.3% on Indian agricultural goods in the US, according to the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).  \nBilateral farm trade between India and the US is modest, at just $8bn (\u00a36.2bn).\nIndia mainly exports rice, shrimp, honey, vegetable extracts, castor oil and black pepper, while the US sends almonds, walnuts, pistachios, apples and lentils. \nBut as the two countries work on a trade deal, experts say Washington now wants to push \"big-ticket\" farm exports - wheat, cotton, corn and maize - to narrow its $45bn trade deficit with India.\n\"They're not looking to export berries and stuff this time. The game is much bigger,\" says Biswajit Dhar, a trade expert from the Delhi-based Council for Social Development think tank. \nPushing India to lower farm tariffs, cut price support and open up to genetically modified (GM) crops and dairy ignores the fundamental asymmetry in global agriculture, experts argue. \nThe US, for instance, heavily subsidises its agriculture and protects farmers through crop insurance. \n\"In some cases,\" says Ajay Srivastava of GTRI, \"US subsidies exceed 100% of production costs, creating an uneven playing field that could devastate India's smallholder farmers.\"\nAbhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, says \"the key thing to remember is that agriculture in the two countries is entirely different\".\n\"The US has commercial agriculture, while India relies on intensive, subsistence farming. It's a question of the livelihoods of millions of Indians versus the interests of US agribusiness.\"\nBut India's agricultural challenges aren't just external. Mr Dhar says much of the sector's struggles are \"its own doing\". Smallholder farmers, owning over 85% of holdings, lack investment capacity, while the private sector shows little interest. Farming receives less than 6% of India's total government and private infrastructure investment, leaving irrigation and storage facilities underfunded.\nTo protect millions of livelihoods, the government shields key crops like wheat, rice and dairy with import duties and price support. \"But even that doesn't inspire confidence,\" he says.\nFour years ago, tens of thousands of farmers held protests demanding better prices and legal guarantees of minimum government support-price for staples, mainly wheat and rice. \n\"Even relatively well-off farmers selling surpluses don't see a turnaround anytime soon. And if they feel that way, imagine the plight of subsistence farmers,\" says Mr Dhar.\nBeyond domestic discontent, trade negotiations add another layer of complexity. \nMr Das says the real challenge for India will be how \"to have an agreement with the US that takes into account US export interest in agriculture while balancing India's interests in the farm sector\".\nSo what's the way forward?\n\"India must not yield to US pressure to open its agriculture sector,\" says Mr Srivastava. He warns that doing so would disrupt millions of livelihoods, threaten food security and flood local markets with cheap imports. \n\"India must prioritise its national interest and protect its rural economy. Trade cooperation should not come at the cost of our farmers, food sovereignty or policy autonomy.\" \nIn the long run, experts say India must modernise its agriculture, making farming more remunerative, and become more competitive to boost exports. Unupom Kausik of agri-business Olam estimates that with top global yields, India could generate a surplus of 200 million metric tonnes of paddy - enough to supply global trade and combat hunger.\n\"In a way, Trump is holding up a mirror to us. We've done little to invest in agriculture's productive capacity,\" says Mr Dhar. \"For now, buying time is the best strategy - maybe offering the US cheaper imports of industrial goods as a trade-off.\"\nBut for the best outcome, he says, India will have to \"play hardball. Basically, tell the US - we're open to negotiations on other fronts, but don't destabilise our agriculture\".\nClearly India's challenge is to negotiate from a position of strength - offering just enough to keep Washington at the table while safeguarding its rural backbone. After all, in global trade as in farming, timing and patience often yield the best harvest. The jury is out on whether Trump is willing to wait.",

        "article_text": "Bukayo Saka celebrates his goal on his return from injury\nMikel Arteta will not believe his bad luck.\nIn the same game as key player Bukayo Saka scored on his long-awaited return from injury, the Arsenal manager lost another in centre-back Gabriel before their Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid next week.\nThe Brazilian defender limped off in the first half of Arsenal's 2-1 win against Fulham with a hamstring injury - an issue that has plagued the Gunners squad this season, with forward Kai Havertz's season ended by a similar problem and Saka sidelined for 101 days.\nTo add to Arteta's defensive worries, Netherlands international Jurrien Timber also had to be withdrawn against Fulham with a knee injury, while Ben White and Riccardo Calafiori were ruled out of the game with knee trouble.\nWhen could Liverpool seal Premier League title?\nForest boost chances as Champions League race intensifies\nWhile Arteta will sweat on their fitness for Real Madrid's first-leg visit next Tuesday, Saka helped take his manager's mind off injuries just seven minutes into his return as his goal sealed three points for an Arsenal side that has missed his quality. \nThe joy of seeing the 23-year-old back, and on the scoresheet, was clear among their supporters and the England international ran to celebrate with the club's lead physical performance coach Sam Wilson, who had helped him in his comeback.\n\"Yes, I think a beautiful moment to see how much our people love, respect and admire Bukayo.\" Arteta said of the celebrations following Saka's 73rd-minute goal.\n\"He's not a surprise to any of us and I think the best example is his reaction. \n\"Immediately after scoring a goal, what does he do? He goes and says thank you for all the hard work that all the sports science guys, physios and everybody involved in the recovery have done for him to be able to be in the condition that he is.\n\"I think he lifted the stadium, the energy and great to have him back.\"\nArsenal have struggled to break teams down in Saka's absence and that has been made worse with season-ending injuries to Havertz and Brazil forward Gabriel Jesus that derailed their Premier League title bid.\nThe pattern of them having lots of possession and not creating goalscoring opportunities is one supporters have seen a lot this season, and was shown again in the first half before makeshift striker Mikel Merino scored the 37th-minute opener.\nCheered by fans when his name was read out, Saka received a standing ovation when he warmed up for the first time and again when he returned to the pitch for the first time since December.\nArsenal supporters, and the club, know how important he is, and with the Champions League the only trophy left available to them this season, they need him to have any chance of getting past European champions Real Madrid in the last eight.\nThe stats back up the impact Saka has when he is in the side too. \nIn the 16 Premier League games when he was available before his injury, the Gunners scored 34 goals at a rate of 2.1 per game.\nIn the 13 he subsequently missed, they scored 19 at a rate of 1.5 per match.\nTheir points per game dropped from 2.1 to 1.9 in the time he was sidelined, while the expected goals also dropped from 1.9 to 1.2 per match and big chances per game also falling from 3.4 to 2.4 without him.\n\"It's clear to see Arsenal's fall away in the Premier League [since his injury]. There is a huge reliance on Saka and, while he has been out, they have hugely missed him.\" former Brighton striker Glenn Murray told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"He is back now and just in time for Real Madrid next week. It's a huge game and he will have that firmly in his sights.\n\"I think the return of Saka not only lifts the players but the whole place. Arsenal have needed a lift in all honesty.\"\nThe win over Fulham moved them to within nine points of league leaders Liverpool but the Gunners have played a game more and Murray admitted Saka's absence has been a huge reason for that.\n\"They have seen the Premier League title drifting away from them in recent weeks, they've not had a number nine and have been without their 'starboy' Saka,\" he added.\n\"There feels like there's been a lift in belief around the Emirates. Even if he is not at full tilt immediately he will bring so much to those around him.\n\"Saka is the difference maker. He just knows where to be, what to do. This time he arrives right on time at the back post to nudge the ball into an empty net.\"\nSaka scores seven minutes into return as Arsenal beat Fulham\nIt seems unlikely centre-back Gabriel is going to recover from a suspected hamstring injury in six days to play in a European quarter-final.\nHe is a key player for Arteta at both ends of the pitch and it will be a huge blow to Arsenal if ruled out of the Real Madrid tie.\nThe 27-year-old has scored three goals and has three assists in 28 Premier League games this season and no defender has scored more goals than the Brazilian's 17 since his debut against Fulham in September 2020.\nGabriel's injury will be assessed as Arteta confirmed: \"Gabi felt something in his hamstring.\n\"We don't know how big that is and with Jurrien as well. He was already struggling very early in the game. He managed to continue, at some point he couldn't, so that's the downside to it.\"\nArsenal's win percentage suffers when Gabriel is out of the team. The team's win percentage is 63.50% from the 159 games he has played since his Premier League debut compared to 40.90% in the 22 games he has missed in the league during that time.\nGabriel has been one of Arsenal's best performers in a challenging season and team-mate Declan Rice acknowledged his value to their Champions League chances.\n\"I don't know what's happened, I hope he's OK because he's been arguably our best player this season and we need him for big matches and big occasions.\" added Rice.\nDespite the setbacks and not being able to name a settled line-up for the majority of this campaign, Arteta said he was looking forward to future challenges. \n\"The good thing is that it's been like this the whole season.\" he added. \n\"You see [Gabriel] Martinelli today, you say we missed him three months. You see Bukayo four months, Kai four months, Gabi Jesus, almost the whole season. \n\"How we have managed to be where we are with all those injuries, Ben White hasn't participated at all this season.\n\"It's what it is.

The team's win percentage is 63.50% from the 159 games he has played since his Premier League debut compared to 40.90% in the 22 games he has missed in the league during that time.Gabriel has been one of Arsenal's best performers in a challenging season and team-mate Declan Rice acknowledged his value to their Champions League chances. \"It's clear to see Arsenal's fall away in the Premier League [since his injury].",

        "article_text": "Tyler Dibling has starred for Southampton despite their Premier League struggles\n\"Tyler has uniqueness. In a world and industry which is becoming more commercialised, over sanitised, robotic, structured and predictable, Tyler's greatest strength is the opposite to all of that.\"\nThat's quite the sell for Southampton's 19-year-old midfield star Tyler Dibling, especially given his basic Premier League career numbers amount to 25 appearances, 1540 minutes played, two goals and zero assists.\nBut that gushing description from one senior source at the club, speaking to BBC Sport anonymously, hints at an emerging talent interesting a host of top clubs and why there are some unsubstantiated reports of a \u00a3100m price tag on his head.\nWith the Saints facing an immediate relegation back to the Championship, Dibling's future is likely to be one of the summer's more interesting sagas, with Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Bayern Munich all reportedly chasing his signature.\nAnother source close to the club suggested Southampton turned down previously unreported bids of \u00a335m from Tottenham and \u00a330m from RB Leipzig in January, with the club valuing Dibling at \u00a355m at the start of the winter window. \nSouthampton have not commented on those rumours, but what is known is that Dibling is one of the lowest paid players in Southampton's squad and has a deal that expires in 2027, after Southampton triggered a 12-month extension option.\nHe signed his last contract in December 2023, when he had played just five minutes of senior football. \nThe England Under-21 international has so far resisted the club's offers of a new deal in what has been a breakthrough season for him, despite a wretched campaign which could still see Southampton relegated with the Premier League's lowest ever points total. \nDig a little deeper into Dibling's stats, and his ball-carrying distance per game (207.3m), his total dribbles attempted (83), and his total dribbles completed (40) put him in the top 20 Premier League players.\nHis dribbles completed per game (2.34) and fouls won per game (2.57) place him in the top 10.\n\"He's the most fearless player I've ever worked with,\" former Saints Under-21 head coach Adam Asghar tells BBC Sport. \n\"He's totally unique to anything I've seen before. He's got raw physicality, pace and power, is an unbelievable ball-carrier and is always impacting games.\n\"In a generation of football where it's very much about limited touches and moving the ball quickly Tyler can move it as quickly by carrying the ball rather than passing it and that's what makes him such a special talent. \n\"Every game (with the Under-21s) he would always have four or five moments that would almost take your breath away.\n\"He is really sure of his ability. He wouldn't be fazed by the opponent or situation, he played with fearlessness.\"\nTyler Dibling has scored three goals in 30 games for Southampton this season\nAt 15, Dibling played for Southampton Under\u201121s and at 16 scored a hat\u2011trick of almost identical goals against Newcastle, the video of the strikes going viral. , external\nEngland honours followed, progressing from the Under-16s through to the Under-21s, when he was given his debut against Spain in November. \nSeveral coaches who have worked with him have described to BBC Sport a mercurial forward who can be \"introverted\" - a quiet, unassuming young man off the pitch who transforms into the main attraction on it.\nRyan Garry managed him for England Under-17s, in a group which included Arsenal duo Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly.\n\"He gets on with all his team-mates, he isn't the main voice in the room but he wouldn't exclude himself,\" said Garry, now assistant at Belgium side Lommel, one of the clubs under the City Football Group umbrella. \n\"There is a completely different characteristic when he is on the pitch compared to how he is off, but it's good - there's nothing wrong with that. He is a lovely kid and I really enjoyed working with him.\n\"He showed he had X-Factor. My personal challenge was to try to get him to show that in every session. Sometimes you've got boys who are on camp together, it takes them a little while to adjust to the group, the schedule and they're away from home.\n\"In terms of his potential - it's huge.\"\nAsghar, who worked with Dibling during the 2023-24 season after joining from Sunderland said he was \"always outgoing in the right circumstances\".\n\"Your job as a coach is to try and influence his behaviour and that's what the talented ones will make you do,\" he added. \n\"When you spoke to him it was clear what he wants. It could be quite blunt in terms of the training content he likes, how he wants to play the game. That's why you can see him handle the transition to the big stage really well. \n\"He knows what he wants, he knows what he can bring and some things that can be maybe portrayed as aloof. \n\"The guys who have worked with him definitely know that's not the case. He's a good boy, he wants to listen, he'll take things in.\" \nIn 2022, Dibling - who had been with Southampton since he was eight - moved to Chelsea. But he only stayed at Stamford Bridge for six weeks.\nChelsea had watched Dibling for years before being able to sign him at 16, yet he encountered problems immediately.\nHe was unable to play and train with his new team-mates as Chelsea abided by the Premier League's five-step review process, an investigation used during transfers for academy players before they can be registered to ensure everything is above board with the move.\nWhile his new team-mates went to win a pre-season tournament in Germany in the summer of 2022, strengthening their bond, Dibling was training alone with a coach.\nThat isolation was a large reason for him struggling to settle and the clubs were still in negotiations over a fee when Dibling made his desire to return to Southampton clear after just six weeks.\nHomesick, he was desperate to go back to Saints.\nHe confided in academy coach Jeremy Newton about how he was feeling following a game against Southampton Under-18s.\nWhile Chelsea wanted to keep a player they believed would become exceptional, they had a duty of care to a teenager and reluctantly let him go, having not even paid a fee.\n\"It's a real credit to all the [Southampton] staff who created the environment that Tyler realised what he was missing. Bear in mind he was a Chelsea fan and living out his boyhood dream,\" said a Southampton source.\n\"When he didn't have that any more, he realised the importance of it.\"\nDibling then signed his first professional deal in February 2023 and six months later made his senior debut in a 3-1 Carabao Cup defeat at Gillingham.\nIt led to four more appearances for the first team as they won promotion back to the Premier League, beating Leeds in the play-off final.\nAsghar - now under-18s head coach at Celtic - watched his transition and believes the slow adjustment period has aided his development this term.\nHe said: \"If Tyler was to reflect on it, he'd probably say it was a bit of a frustrating year. He had to be training with the first team, which was 100% right for his development, and be part of the squads and then try to get his minutes for the under-21s on a Friday.\n\"Learning how to be a professional, learning how to act and behave in that environment was really important.\n\"In Tyler's head he was ready, so that was where the frustration came from.\n\"Sometimes we had to take him off after 45 minutes or 60 minutes of the under-21s because he was required for the first-team game on Saturday, and he would have an emotional reaction.\n\"He's used all his experience from last year, used that as motivation, and he's probably reflected on it and come back for pre-season knowing what he had to do.\"\nThere is a belief among some of the coaches BBC Sport spoke to that Dibling will eventually become an established number 10, despite impressing out wide for Southampton.\nOn his first Premier League start in September he won a penalty against Manchester United, and on his second he scored against Ipswich.\nDespite surprisingly recording no assists in the Premier League this season, Dibling averages 8.5 progressive carries each game and creates more than one chance a game too. However, his successful passes per game (22.7) and passing accuracy (83.1%) are only 11th best among his team-mates.\nJack Grealish has been criticised for losing his 'personality' on the pitch and failing to justify the \u00a3100m spent on him following his move to Manchester City from Aston Villa in 2021.\nThose who know Dibling remain confident he will not suffer the same fate because the strong-willed teenager knows the environment he needs to thrive and - should he move - to choose the best option.\nPaul MacDonald, of FootballTransfers.com says their Estimated Transfer Value (ETV) algorithm puts Dibling at \u00a326.5m, given his contract situation and one season of experience.\nMacDonald said: \"However, the ETV algorithm rates his future potential highly. Of course, quotes of \u00a3100m are completely silly, but we've got him valued as the 15th most valuable under-20 player in the world.\", external\n\"As long as there is a big green rectangle, 22 players and a ball then Tyler will flourish. He just wants to play football,\" a well-placed source told BBC Sport.\n\"Tyler knows the right fit for him. He knows what the conditions have to look like. He knows what type of manager he can work best with. I have no doubt whatever his next step looks like he will choose the right option.\n\"He is unique, unpredictable, exciting and, undeniably, he is himself.\" ",

A further charge was later added to the case.\nIn addition to his two Olympic titles, Jakob Ingebrigtsen is a two-time 5,000m world champion, two-time outdoor world 1500m silver medallist, and 16-time European champion.\nHe recently won two world indoor titles, taking gold in the 3,000m and 1500m in Nanjing, China.",

He said he had tried to shield all seven of his children, two more of whom also became successful athletes.

        "article_text": "Ask a group of film fans which role they will most remember actor Val Kilmer for, and each person will probably give you a different answer. \nHis performances in films like The Doors, Heat and Batman Forever are all likely to come up, while Willow and True Romance have their own dedicated fans. \nOne of his biggest films, Top Gun, is not only beloved by people old enough to have seen it when it was released in 1986, but also a much younger generation who are familiar with the much-memed scene of Kilmer's Iceman playing volleyball. \nHere are some of his most memorable roles from his wide-ranging stage and screen career. \nKilmer's first screen role was opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in an ABC Afterschool Special. He played her character's boyfriend, who drives drunk with devastating results.\nAnother of his earliest film roles was in 1985 comedy film Real Genius, in which he starred opposite Gabriel Jarret.\nKilmer's real career breakthrough came the following year, when he appeared in Top Gun, one of the biggest box office hits of the 1980s.\nKilmer played Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky, the arrogant rival to Tom Cruise's Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell.\nTwo years later, Kilmer starred as a mercenary swordsman in Willow, the fantasy adventure directed by Ron Howard.\nKilmer and Joanne Whalley starred together in films including Willow and Twixt, and in 1989 they played a couple who rob a pair of Las Vegas mobsters in Kill Me Again. They got married in 1988.\nKilmer channelled the spirit of singer Jim Morrison in director Oliver Stone's 1991 biopic of US rock band The Doors.\nIn 1993's True Romance, Kilmer played a version of Elvis Presley who is a figment of Christian Slater's imagination. The film was written by Quentin Tarantino and saw Kilmer reunited with Top Gun director Tony Scott.\nIn 1995, Kilmer delivered a memorable and chilling performance in Michael Mann's Heat, as the right-hand man of a criminal played by Robert De Niro.\nIn the same year, Kilner played one of his most defining roles as Bruce Wayne, the titular superhero in Batman Forever, opposite Nicole Kidman.\nIn 1997, Kilmer appeared in The Saint as a high-tech thief and master of disguise who uses the moniker of various saints.\nNot all of Kilmer's films were box office hits, however. The Island Of Dr Moreau, released in 1996, was a critical and comercial flop.\nRed Planet, which was set on Mars, earned $33m on a budget of $80m in 2000.\nIn 2004, Kilmer played King Philip in Alexander, which co-starred Colin Farrell as Alexander the Great.\nKilmer's stage roles included a 2005 stint in London's West End in The Postman Always Rings Twice at the Playhouse Theatre.\nLater that year, he appeared with Robert Downey Jr (right) and Michelle Monoghan (centre) in the crime comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\nIn 2006, he appeared  in CBS mini-series Comanche Moon, pictured with Troy Baker as Pea Eye Parker (left) and Keith Robinson as Joshua Deets (right).\nKilmer again reunited with Top Gun director Tony Scott for hit 2006 action sci-fi film Deja Vu, also starring Denzel Washington (left) and Adam Goldberg (right).\nKilmer starred in two films opposite rapper 50 Cent - 2009's Streets of Blood and 2010's Gun, both of which were released directly to video and DVD.\nKilmer was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for best spoken word album, for voicing Zorro in an audio drama adaptation of The Mark of Zorro.\nKilmer played writer Mark Twain in a one-man stage show called Citizen Twain in California in 2012.\nLater that year, Kilmer filmed scenes for Terrence Malick's film Song To Song at a Texas music festival. The film was released five years later, in 2017.\nIn 2013, Kilmer appeared as himself in Life's Too Short, the comedy series created by Warwick Davis, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Kilmer and Davis had previously appeared together in Willow.\nKilmer was pictured with Al Pacino at a live reading of Shakespeare's Live Read of The Merchant Of Venice in 2019, more than two decades after starring together in Heat.\nOff screen, Kilmer dated a number of high-profile women over the years, including Cher, Angelina Jolie, Daryl Hannah and Cindy Crawford.\nKilmer launched his movie Twixt at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2011.",

        "article_text": "Richard Chamberlain, who has died today at the age of 90, shot to fame as TV heartthrob Dr Kildare in the 1960s.\nHis dashing good looks won him legions of female fans, and guaranteed him work in a plethora of rather forgettable television movies.\nBut, in middle age, his career spiked again.\nChamberlain became king of the 1980's TV mini-series: playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.\nHe denied being gay when confronted by a French magazine in 1989, and did not speak publicly about his homosexuality until he turned 70.\nIn interviews promoting his 2003 memoir, he advised other handsome leading actors to keep their sexuality to themselves.\n\"There's still a tremendous amount of homophobia in our culture,\" he said. \"Please, don't pretend that we're suddenly all wonderfully, blissfully accepted.\"\nGeorge Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.\nHis salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".\nHe admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics. \nAt Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.\nParamount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.\nOn his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.\nNot everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.\nHe was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".\nBut, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama. \n\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"\nThe series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.\nIt broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.\nThere was a huge reaction from female fans.\nChamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name. \nThe studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.\nFans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems. \nAnd Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.\nHe won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.\nNow an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind. \nIn 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.\nAudiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage. \nHe got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.\nThe production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.' \nIn 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.\nAnd, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.\nThis time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark. \nBut Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson. \nThe critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.\nChamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.\nHe also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building. \nIn 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.\nIt sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.\nHe beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.\nThe series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.  \nHaving won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing afor the actress, Rachel Ward.\nIt was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.\nIn the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.\nThere were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.\nThese included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.\nIn 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.\nDespite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.\n\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"\nChamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.\nIn later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace. \nHe continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.\nBut he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.\n\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"\nHe will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.\nDespite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.\nFor, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience.",

Charges on businesses importing vehicles are expected on 3 April, and taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.\nWhen asked about what his message was to car bosses, he said: \"The message is congratulations. If you make your car in the United States, you're going to make a lot of money.\"\nHe continued: \"If you don't, you're going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"\nRecent polling by BBC's US partner CBS News suggests that consumers are worried the tariffs will raise prices, with 72% indicating that they believe costs will increase in the short-term. More than half of respondents said the Trump administration is not focusing enough on lowering costs for Americans.\nAsked about this sentiment on Sunday, Trump's senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro asked people to put their trust in the US president.\n\"Trust in Trump,\" Navarro told Fox News, adding that previous tariffs on China by the US have led to \"prosperity and price stability\". \n\"The reason why we will not see inflation is because foreigners are going to eat most of it, they have to,\" he said, adding that the US \"is the biggest market in the world.\" \nShawn Fain, the leader of union United Auto Workers, criticised Trump for his labour and immigration policies on CBS Face the Nation - but he said tariffs were a necessary \"tool in the toolbox\" to return manufacturing to the US.\n\"There is plenty of opportunity. And I've had companies tell us, point blank, that they're going to have to bring product back here if those tariffs are implemented.\"\nThe 25% import tax on carmakers from Canada and Mexico was briefly implemented but then paused at the beginning of March, following pleas from major North American manufacturers like Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.\nBut Trump told NBC that he did not plan to delay the tariffs on cars any longer, saying he would consider negotiating \"only if people are willing to give us something of great value - because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there's no room for negotiation\".\nIn another interview with NBC News on Sunday, he threatened to impose secondary tariffs of 25-50% on Russian oil if he feels Vladimir Putin is stalling progress on Ukraine peace talks.\n\"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault - which it might not be - but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\" he told the outlet.\n\"There will be a 25% tariff on oil and other products sold in the United States, secondary tariffs,\" Trump said, adding that tariffs on Russia would come within a month without a ceasefire deal.\nTrump said Putin knows he is angry, but that he has \"a very good relationship\" with the Russian president.\nHe went on to say that \"the anger dissipates quickly\" but only if Putin \"he does the right thing\".\nTrump said he will speak to Putin again this week.\nAnalysts say the upcoming tariffs that Trump has planned could further strain relations with some of the US's main trading partners.\nTrump's comments come as Downing Street sources said the UK would not hesitate to retaliate against US tariffs if needed.\nThe UK is in last-minute negotiations with the White House and is trying to get an exemption, arguing that - unlike other countries - the UK has a relatively equal trading relationship with the US.

        "article_text": "In Jordan, a 50km pilgrimage trail follows the path of a 4th-Century nun who journeyed through the Holy Land \u2013 centuries before Spain's famed Camino de Santiago.\nThe hike begins early in the morning at Mount Nebo, a sacred mountain 610m above sea level in Jordan. On a clear day, panoramic views of the Dead Sea, Bethlehem and Jerusalem stretch across the horizon. According to the Bible, it is the last place Moses gazed upon before his death. Today, it's the first sight walkers see as they set out on their journey along the Camino de Egeria, a pilgrim route first taken by a 4th-Century nun.\u00a0\nThe view is \"magical\", says Silvano Mezzenzana, who recently undertook the three-day hike. He recalls standing atop that peak on the Moab plateau, a dry Sun fanning out over the ridges and farmland beneath, noting that it is fascinating both in the morning when the Sun lights up the Palestinian bank and the city of Jericho, and in the afternoon when the sunset draws the silhouettes of the hills of Judah up to Jerusalem. Up there, \"you do not realise that you are on a mountain\", he adds.\u00a0\nBeginning on the eastern edge of the Great Rift Valley, the 50km route winds through farmland and rugged hills \u2013 a voyage that is far greener than its European equivalent, the 800km Camino de Santiago pilgrim trail undertaken by around 500,000 people each year. Following the January announcement from Jordan and Spain of a merger twinning the Camino de Egeria with the Camino de Santiago to boost their respective cultural heritage, locals hope that the newly-renovated Middle Eastern trail can become a similar phenomenon. The goal is to highlight the significance of the eponymous Egeria, the Spanish nun believed to have travelled by donkey from Jordan through Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Asia Minor to visit the holy places recounted in the Bible. She is thought to be the first woman to make the journey, which pre-dates the famed Camino de Santiago by five centuries.\u00a0\nThe hike is typically split up into three days (though can be done as quickly as in two, or a leisurely five). The terrain is not particularly challenging, but the distance \u2013 of around 17km per day \u2013 makes the hike unsuitable for total novices.\u00a0Last year, wide paths were fixed between the rocky valleys and hills along much of the route, ushering in what the Ministry of Tourism hopes will mark a new era for international interest in the country.\u00a0\nThe effort is already seeing results. \"Although I have lived in Jordan all my life, walking this trail has shown me parts of the country I've never experienced before,\" says Nadeen Dabbas. She recalls the flow of the water at the Moses Springs and the Jordan Valley, where she was surrounded by fields of bananas and corn, as moments that \"made me feel alive\".\nThe Best of 2025\nJordan was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good.\u00a0See the full list here.\nThe first major landmark on day one features a small monastery built by Egyptian monks in Moses' memory, built in the latter half of the 4th Century, enlarged a century later and rebuilt in the 6th Century to a mosaic-filled basilica that still stands today. The trail then passes through the ancient city of Livias, before reaching its showpiece on day two: Al-Maghatas, or Bethany beyond the Jordan. A Unesco World Heritage site, this is believed to be the location where Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist. Pilgrims can explore Byzantine and Roman remains of chapels, churches and monasteries, along with the cave of John the Baptist, and even \"spend the second night there in one of the pilgrim houses of Bethany, just next to the Jordan River\", explains Oscar Koshebye, a guide who helped formalise the current tourist trail. The route finishes here, or at the King Hussein Bridge at the Jordan-Israel border.\nWhile the hike offers striking natural beauty, the real draw may prove to be the woman who likely inspired it. \"Egeria's account is significant because it is one of the oldest written accounts of pilgrimage to the Holy Land that has survived \u2013 and the first incontrovertibly penned by a woman,\" says Anne McGowan, associate professor of liturgy at the Catholic Theological Union and co-author of Pilgrimage of Egeria. Egeria's work was little-known until the 1880s, McGowan adds, originally written in the form of letters to her \"sisters\" (likely holy women similar to herself). An incomplete manuscript dating to the 11th Century is currently the oldest known record of her route.\nEgeria travelled during the 4th Century, when many Christians took long-distance pilgrimages \u2013 something that fell out of favour from the 7th Century until around the mid-19th (aside from a \"blip\" in the wake of the Crusades, in the 12th-13th Centuries), McGowan explains. At that point, \"travel to the Holy Land became easier once again. Going on pilgrimage aligned well with the Romantic Era's renewed enthusiasm for the personal and the subjective on the one hand and an idealised past on the other; and Protestants as a group became more intrigued by pilgrimage possibilities connected to places associated with the life and death of Jesus in a way they hadn't been previously.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nBut now, with religious appetite dwindling (a study published\u00a0last year\u00a0found that atheists now outnumber theists in the UK), Koshebye is hoping that a new generation can be drawn in. \"We can consider it now, after centuries of abandonment, a route for tolerance between faiths, a way to improve intercultural exchange,\" he says.\u00a0\nPlan your trip\nThe Egeria Way branch office is at the Kawon bookshop in Madaba. From here, registered visitors will be taken to trail's start point, 15km away in Mount Nebo. Packages from different tour operators will soon be offered by the Egeria Way Association. Travel within Jordan is safe, though the UK Foreign Office advises against travel within 3km of the border with Syria.\nThe Spanish national and keen hiker began mulling a walking route to Jerusalem five years ago. Having already walked the Spanish Camino, he mentioned his plans to his father, who likened his son's idea to the devout Egeria \u2013 who he had never heard of. Koshebye began reading about the nun and scouring old maps in search of her original route. He later made a YouTube video about his plans, was contacted by the Jordanian tourist board, and then got in touch with the Spanish embassy in Jordan \u2013 a series of collaborative efforts that led to the merger being born.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The Wadi Rum Trail: Jordan's new long-distance hike\n\u2022 A new love for medieval-style travel\n\u2022 The pilgrimage sites of Iraq's timeless and holy cities\nKoshebye hopes that the partnership leads to a surge of interest in this three-day version of the hike and wants it to be extended a further 30km to Jerusalem, another stop on Egeria's route. Plans for signage along the Jordanian route and more guesthouses where walkers can rest in between are already afoot.\nWhile steeped in religious significance, ancient routes of this kind aren't just for those intent on retracing paths drawn by scripture, McGowan says. \"Taking a very long walk still has the capacity to pull one into an inner journey. Younger people are still spiritual seekers, even if their search is typically less closely tied to traditional religious beliefs and practices,\" she believes. \"Their pilgrimages might be more oriented toward the experience of journeying itself, as it seems Egeria's was as well; she does not so much set out on a round trip to visit one particular place, for example, as to experience as many places as possible.\"\nWith time \u2013 and a few more signposts \u2013 those involved in the project hope that Jordan's historic trail can achieve the same cultural significance as its Spanish counterpart. Mezzenzano, for one, has no doubt. \"I would not only recommend\" the trail, he enthuses, \"but I plan to repeat it\". \n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Today, it's the first sight walkers see as they set out on their journey along the Camino de Egeria, a pilgrim route first taken by a 4th-Century nun. Following the January announcement from Jordan and Spain of a merger twinning the Camino de Egeria with the Camino de Santiago to boost their respective cultural heritage, locals hope that the newly-renovated Middle Eastern trail can become a similar phenomenon. \"Egeria's account is significant because it is one of the oldest written accounts of pilgrimage to the Holy Land that has survived \u2013 and the first incontrovertibly penned by a woman,\" says Anne McGowan, associate professor of liturgy at the Catholic Theological Union and co-author of Pilgrimage of Egeria.

        "article_text": "Warning: This article contains details and images that some readers may find distressing\nDriving into Mandalay, the massive scale of the destruction from last Friday's earthquake revealed itself bit by bit.\nIn nearly every street we turned into, especially in the northern and central parts of the city, at least one building had completely collapsed, reduced to a pile of rubble. Some streets had multiple structures which had come down.\nAlmost every building we saw had cracks running through at least one of its walls, unsafe to step into. At the main city hospital they're having to treat patients outdoors.\nMyanmar's military government has said it's not allowing foreign journalists into the country after the quake, so we went in undercover. We had to operate carefully, because the country is riddled with informers and secret police who spy on their own people for the ruling military junta.\nWhat we witnessed was a people who had very little help coming their way in the face of this massive disaster.\n\"I have hope that he's alive, even if it's a small chance,\" said Nan Sin Hein, 41, who's been waiting on the street opposite a collapsed five-storey building, day and night for five days. \nHer 21 year-old-son Sai Han Pha was a construction worker, renovating the interiors of the building, which used to be a hotel and was being turned into an office space.\n\"If they can rescue him today, there's a chance he'll survive,\" she says.\nWhen the 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck, the bottom of the building sank into the ground, its top lurching at an angle over the street, looking like it could tip over at any minute.\nSai Han Pha and four other workers were trapped inside.\nWhen we visited, rescue efforts had not even begun at the building and there was no sign they would start soon. There just isn't enough help available on the ground - and the reason for that is the political situation in the country.\nEven before the earthquake Myanmar was in turmoil - locked in a civil war that has displaced an estimated 3.5 million people. Its military has continued operations against armed insurgent groups despite the disaster.\nThis means that security forces are too stretched to put their full might behind relief and rescue operations. Except in some key locations, we didn't see them in large numbers in Mandalay.\nThe military junta has put out a rare appeal for international aid, but its uneasy relations with many foreign countries, including the UK and the US, has meant that while these countries have pledged aid, help in the form of manpower on the ground is currently only from countries like India, China and Russia, among a few others.\nAnd so far those rescue efforts appear to be focused on structures where masses of people are feared trapped \u2013 the high-rise Sky Villa condominium complex which was home to hundreds of people, and U Hla Thein Buddhist academy where scores of monks were taking an examination when the earthquake struck.\nNeeraj Singh, who is leading the Indian disaster response team working at the Buddhist academy, said the structure had collapsed like a \"pancake\" - one layer on top of another.\n\"It's the most difficult collapse pattern and the chances of finding survivors are very low. But we are still hopeful and trying our best,\" he told the BBC.\nWorking under the sweltering sun, in nearly 40C, rescuers use metal drills and cutters to break the concrete slabs into smaller pieces. It's slow and extremely demanding work. When a crane lifts up the concrete pieces, the stench of decaying bodies, already quite strong, becomes overwhelming.\nThe rescuers spot four to five bodies, but it still takes a couple of hours to pull the first one out.\nSitting on mats under a makeshift tent in the compound of the academy are families of the students. Their faces are weary and despondent. As soon as they hear a body has been recovered, they crowd around the ambulance it is placed in.\nOthers gather around a rescuer who shows them a photo of the body on his mobile phone.\nAgonising moments pass as the families try to see if the dead man is a loved one.\nBut the body is so disfigured, the task is impossible. It is sent to a morgue where forensic tests will have to be conducted to confirm the identity.\nAmong the families is the father of 29-year-old U Thuzana. He has no hope that his son survived. \"Knowing my son ended up like this, I'm inconsolable, I'm filled with grief,\" U Hla Aung said, his face crumpling into a sob.\nMany of Mandalay's historical sites have also suffered significant damage, including the Mandalay Palace and the Maha Muni Pagoda, but we could not get in to see the extent of the damage.\nAccess to everything - collapse sites, victims and their families - was not easy because of the oppressive environment created by the military junta, with people often fearful of speaking to journalists.\nClose to the pagoda, we saw Buddhist funeral rituals being held on the street outside a destroyed house. It was the home of U Hla Aung Khaing and his wife Daw Mamarhtay, both in their sixties.\n\"I lived with them but was out when the earthquake struck. That's why I survived. Both my parents are gone in a single moment,\" their son told us.\nTheir bodies were extricated not by trained rescuers, but by locals who used rudimentary equipment. It took two days to pull out the couple, who were found with their arms around each other.\nMyanmar's military government says 2,886 people have died so far, but so many collapse sites have still not even been reached by the authorities, that that count is unlikely to be accurate. We may never find out what the real death toll of the earthquake was.\nParks and open spaces in Mandalay have turned into makeshift camps, as have the banks of the moat that runs around the palace. All over the city we saw people laying out mats and mattresses outside their homes as evening approached, preferring to sleep outdoors.\nMandalay is a city living in terror, and with good reason. Nearly every night since Friday there have been big aftershocks. We woke up to an aftershock of magnitude 5 in the middle of the night.\nBut tens of thousands are sleeping outdoors because they have no home to return to.\n\"I don't know what to think anymore. My heart still trembles when I think of that moment when the earthquake struck,\" said Daw Khin Saw Myint, 72, who we met while she was waiting in a queue for water, with her little granddaughter by her side. \"We ran out, but my house is gone. I'm living under a tree. Come and see.\"\nShe works as a washerwoman and says her son suffers from a disability which doesn't allow him to work.\n\"Where will I live now? I am in so much trouble. I'm living next to a rubbish dump. Some people have given me rice and a few clothes. We ran out in these clothes we are wearing.\n\"We don't have anyone to rescue us. Please help us,\" she said, tears rolling down her cheeks.\nAnother elderly woman chimes in, eyes tearing up, \"No one has distributed food yet today. So we haven't eaten.\"\nMost of the vehicles we saw pulling up to distribute supplies were small vans with limited stocks - donations from individuals or small local organisations. It's nowhere near enough for the number of people in need, leading to a scramble to grab whatever relief is available.\nParts of Mandalay's main hospital are also damaged, and so in an already difficult situation, rows and rows of beds are laid out in the hospital compound for patients.\nShwe Gy Thun Phyo, 14, has suffered from a brain injury, and has bloodshot eyes. She's conscious but unresponsive. Her father tries to make her as comfortable as possible.\nThere were very few doctors and nurses around to cope with the demand for treatment, which means families are stepping in to do what medical staff should.\nZar Zar has a distended belly because of a serious abdominal injury. Her daughter sits behind her, holding her up, and fans her, to give her some relief from the heat.\nWe couldn't spend a lot of time at the hospital for fear of being apprehended by the police or military.\nAs the window to find survivors of the earthquake narrows, increasingly those being brought into the hospital are the dead.\nNan Sin Hein, who is waiting outside the collapsed building where her son was trapped, was initially stoical, but she now looks like she is preparing to face what seems like the most likely outcome.\n\"I'm heartbroken. My son loved me and his little sisters. He struggled to support us,\" she says.\n\"I am just hoping to see my son's face, even if he is dead. I want to see his body. I want them to do everything they can to find his body.\"",

He died one day before his 91st birthday.\nHis salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".\nHe admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics. \nAt Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.\nParamount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.\nOn his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.\nNot everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.\nHe was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".\nBut, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama. \n\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"\nThe series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.\nIt broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.\nThere was a huge reaction from female fans.\nChamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name. \nThe studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.\nFans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems. \nAnd Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.\nHe won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.\nNow an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind. \nIn 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.\nAudiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage. \nHe got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.\nThe production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.' \nIn 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.\nAnd, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.\nThis time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark. \nBut Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson. \nThe critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.\nChamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.\nHe also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building. \nIn 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.\nIt sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.\nHe beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.\nThe series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.  \nHaving won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing for the actress, Rachel Ward.\nIt was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.\nIn the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.\nThere were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.\nThese included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.\nIn 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.\nDespite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.\n\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"\nChamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.\nIn later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace. \nHe continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.\nBut he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.\n\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"\nHe will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.\nDespite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.\nFor, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience.",

At Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.Paramount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.On his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.Getty ImagesRichard Chamberlain won a Golden Globe as Dr James Kildare Not everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.He was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".But, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama.",

She posed for a picture with him after attending one of his workshops and later left a glowing video testimonial.\nIt was unremarkable, Mr Burton says. \"Just one of the thousands of people I must have met over the years.\"\nTwo years later, she started attacking him online.\nIn hundreds of posts, Wall described him as manipulative, a psychopath and a sociopathic abuser. Day after day, she accused him of making death threats, breaking her windows and killing her cat - all false allegations.\n\"She put it on social media across all platforms. She was painting a picture that, somewhere along the way, I had done all these things and I was trying to cover it up,\" Mr Burton tells BBC Panorama.\n\"How do you prove a negative? That I had not poisoned the cat? Social media and the way it works, it's guilty until proven innocent.\"\nWall, 55, a social media consultant, pleaded guilty to charges of stalking and sending false messages at Manchester Magistrates' Court last November.\nHer sentencing was delayed for a second time last week, but the judge told her to expect a prison sentence.\nWall's legal team said a psychiatric report shows she has a chronic delusional mental health illness.\nHer conviction was in relation to two victims - Mr Burton and businesswoman Naomi Timperley - who were targeted with abusive messages over the past four years.\n\"It's just been hideous, really hideous, and I don't know why it happened,\" Mrs Timperley tells us. \"I'm still really anxious, sometimes I get really sad.\"\nBBC Panorama has spoken to other victims who say they were stalked by Wall over a period of more than 10 years.\nSome had never met Wall, while others only knew her as a passing acquaintance.\nAt the time Wall targeted Mr Burton, he was running a network supporting hundreds of small businesses across the UK.\nMany of her abusive posts were detailed - one was 20,000 words long. Some were shared on LinkedIn, where she had 30,000 followers - the very platform Mr Burton relied on to promote his work.\nWhile the pandemic hit him hard, he says she helped to sink his business.\nWall also falsely claimed that Mr Burton had in fact been harassing her for 10 years - and that he had been arrested and jailed.\nMr Burton posted pictures of himself online to prove he was not in prison. Wall responded by claiming his psychopathic twin was taking the photos and appearing at events to cover up the fact he had been locked up.\nHis friend Alan Price knew Wall was lying about the 10-year claim, because he had introduced them at the workshop two years earlier.\n\"She's telling everybody that Brad Burton is in jail, but I was actually out in Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset having a curry with him,\" he says.\nIn an attempt to stop her, Mr Burton went to a solicitor who advised him to send a cease and desist letter. Wall then responded by publishing the letter online and saying he could sue her - but she had no money.\nMrs Timperley had only met Wall in passing - she followed her on Twitter and they were connected on LinkedIn. She was also targeted with hundreds of messages - accused of criminal damage, destroying Wall's business and of joining up with others to carry out so-called gang stalking. \nWall also falsely claimed Mrs Timperley had been arrested for harassment.\n\"I've been personally attacked on Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook and accused of really vile things,\" she tells us.\nWall continued her online attacks even after she had been charged with stalking.\nManchester-based entrepreneur Justine Wright was targeted over a decade. She had employed Wall for a couple of months and, when Wall left, the online stalking began.\nMs Wright is a marketing consultant and Wall repeatedly targeted her clients - major companies - with false claims. Justine had never met Brad, but Wall accused her of conspiring with him to poison her cat.\nPeople might be surprised by the number of victims and that Wall did not disguise her identity, says Rory Innes, chief executive of the Cyber Helpline, a charity that helps victims of online crime. \nBut he says this is common.\n\"It's a horrendous case and she will be causing harm to lots of people and changing their lives. But this is happening to hundreds of thousands of people every year.\"\nPanorama has spoken to other victims who do not want to be identified. One says he was stalked for more than a decade, during which time Wall sent thousands of texts, plus 10,000-word emails to his friends and business contacts.\nWall would also turn up at his work pretending to be his wife, he says, and accusing him of domestic abuse.\nAll of the victims complained to the social media companies about Wall's posts, but they have not been taken down.\nSocial media lawyer Paul Tweed tells Panorama he was not surprised the companies had failed to help.\n\"They decide what should be taken down, they decide when it should be taken down and how it should be taken down. And they will say, when you ask them, that they comply with the law,\" he says.\nLinkedIn says it can't comment on individual users, but it does not allow bullying or harassment and it will take action against anything that violates its policies. Instagram, Facebook and X did not respond to Panorama's request for comment.\nNone of the companies have taken down Wall's abusive messages, even though Panorama told them about Wall's conviction two months ago.\nLast week, she posted another abusive message about Mr Burton.\nThe charity Cyber Helpline has estimated that 600,000 people report online stalking to the police every year. Another charity, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, says fewer than 2% of stalking and harassment complaints end with a conviction.\nA major review by policing bodies last year found a lack of understanding of online stalking and evidence of the police failing to take it seriously.\nThe advice to victims of online stalking is basic - don't engage, keep records and report it to the police. But the people Panorama spoke to did that, and the abuse continued.\nMr Burton and and Mrs Timperley were unhappy with the response they got from Greater Manchester Police (GMP).\nOutcomes for victims are really poor, Roy Innes from the Cyber Helpline says.\n\"So few of these cases actually end up with an investigation,\" he says. \"And when an investigation does happen, the technology element can mean it takes years to get to the point where the evidence is being looked at.\"\nA spokesperson for GMP says delays in the wider criminal justice system affected Wall's case and the force achieved positive outcomes for more than 3,000 victims of this type of crime last year.\nWe approached Wall for comment, but she did not respond.\nMeanwhile, Mr Burton says he forgives her. \"I hope she gets the help that she needs and she finds peace in her own life,\" he says.",

He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us.\"\nRabbett added: \"Love never dies. And our love is under his wings, lifting him to his next great adventure.\"\nChamberlain's big break came in 1961, when he became a household name as Dr James Kildare in Dr Kildare. \nThe show, based on a popular 1930s and 40s film series, attracted millions of viewers, turning Chamberlain into a beloved leading man and a teen idol.\nThe popularity Dr Kildare earnt Chamberlain meant that, for three consecutive years between 1963 and 1965, he was named the most popular male star by Photoplay magazine.\nHe went on to become the king of the 1980s TV mini-series, playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.\nThe latter won 60% of the US television audience and earned 16 Emmy nominations.\nThough widely recognised as a romantic leading man, Chamberlain's private life remained largely a mystery until later in his life.\nHe did not publicly address his sexuality until the release of his memoir, Shattered Love, in 2003, where he revealed that he was gay.\nThroughout his 30-year relationship with actor-director Rabbett, they had kept their private life secret.\nIn his memoir, he recalled escorting glamorous actresses to premieres, explaining that he had been \"desperately afraid\" his sexuality would derail his career.\n\"I used to get chased by hot teenage girls,\" he once told TV Guide. \"I got 12,000 fan letters a week. And I felt somewhat besieged.\"\nRabbett and Chamberlain separated in 2010 but remained close. \nBorn on 31 March 1934 in Beverly Hills, California, Chamberlain grew up on what he called \"the wrong side of Wilshire Boulevard\" - far from the wealth of Hollywood's star-studded district.\nThe younger of two boys, his father, Charles, was a salesman who struggled with alcoholism and became a prominent figure in Alcoholics Anonymous, travelling the world to speak at conventions. His mother, Elsa, was a homemaker.\nHe initially studied painting at Pomona College, but a student theatre performance inspired him to pursue acting.\nInterest from a Hollywood scout was put on hold as he was drafted into the US Army, where he rose to the rank of sergeant while stationed in South Korea.\nUpon returning to California, Chamberlain took acting classes, landing several small TV roles before his breakout role as Dr Kildare.\nYears later, Chamberlain recounted the psychological abuse he endured during his childhood. \nHe described how his father's \"lethal sneer\" and emotionally abusive behaviour made him feel as if he were being \"slashed with a machete\". \nChamberlain also spoke about the relief he experienced in finally not having to hide his sexuality later in life.",

        "article_text": "Inside a soundstage once used by silent film stars Charlie Chaplin and Mabel Normand, Hollywood executives, actors and filmmakers sipped cocktails as they marvelled at what some say is the biggest breakthrough since the talkies: AI-generated video.\nBut whether AI will be the future, or the end, of cinema is still up for debate.\nIt was only two years ago that actors and writers shut down Hollywood with strikes demanding protections from AI. Now the technology is controversially creeping into TV, movies and video games. Two films honoured at the Oscars even used the technology. \nAs a DJ played '90s hip hop, computer developers rubbed shoulders actors and executives, in a sign of the changing power players in the industry.\nAI in Hollywood is \"inevitable\", says Bryn Mooser, the party's host and the co-founder of Moonvalley, which created the AI generator tool \"Marey\" by paying for footage from filmmakers with their consent. Mr Mooser says that while AI may still be a dirty word, their product is \"clean\" because it pays for its content.\nAI may be a dirty word in Hollywood, but Mr Mooser says their version of the technology is \"clean.\"\n\"Artists should be at the table,\" he says, adding that it's better to build the tool for filmmakers rather than get \"rolled over by big tech companies\".\nArtificial Intelligence has long been depicted as a villain in Hollywood. In \"The Terminator,\" AI used by the US military decides it must destroy everyone on Earth.\nBut it's AI's creators, and not the technology itself, that has received the brunt of real-life criticism. Companies use publicly available data to build their AI models - which includes copyrighted material shared online - and creators say they're being ripped off.\nOpenAI, Google and other tech companies are facing multiple lawsuits from writers, actors and news organizations, alleging their work was stolen to train AI without their consent. Studios like Paramount, Disney and Universal who own the copyright on movies and TV shows have been urged by writers to do the same, though none have taken legal action.\n\"We've all fought very hard for copyright laws, and nobody wants to see their work stolen to have somebody else profit from it,\" Mr Mooser says. \nHollywood has begun toying with the new technology. The Oscar-nominated films Emilia Perez and The Brutalist used AI to alter voices. Adrian Brody won the Academy Award for best actor, even with the help of AI to fine tune his accent when he spoke Hungarian in his starring role in The Brutalist. AI has even been used to de-age actors like Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford.\nThe technology is seemingly everywhere. OpenAI hosted an AI film festival in Los Angeles earlier this month. Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo told the Wall Street Journal they plan to invest $400 million to craft AI tools for filmmakers.\nBut the impacts on how it will alter the future of the entertainment industry remain unclear. Generative AI, for instance, allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human \u2013 albeit much faster. And many worry about the technology replacing their jobs as AI is used to generate scripts, animation, locations, voices and human actors.\nIf you ask OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, which Hollywood jobs are most easily replaced by AI, background actors are top of the list as \"most vulnerable\" with \"A-List actors & directors\" considered safest because \"star power and brand recognition keep top talent irreplaceable\".\nAt the Moonvalley party, everyone was talking about new AI technology though few wanted to speak with a reporter on record about it. But dozens of powerful people made the trek east to the hip Silver Lake neighbourhood from West Los Angeles even though it was raining. In LA, that's remarkable.\n\"We're here to learn,\" said one executive who spent an hour in traffic getting to the party. \"We're not signing anything or buying anything, but we're interested.\"\nMooser and his co-founder Naeem Talukdar speak passionately about how AI will transform Hollywood and allow filmmakers to create blockbuster style epics on much lower budgets. It could lead to many bad films - but it could also help discover the next Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese, even if they don't have the backing of a big studio.\n\"This technology is utterly meaningless without the artist at the centre of it; the technology needs to ultimately be subservient to the artist,\" says Mr Talukdar.\nHollywood's foray into using AI comes as the Trump administration prepares a new AI plan for the United States. \nTech companies say they can't compete with China under existing US copyright laws and that they need unfettered access to art - from Mickey Mouse to Moana to The Matrix - to train their AI models as a matter of national security.\nGoogle and OpenAI want the US government to designate copyrighted art, movies and TV shows as \"fair use\" for them to train AI, arguing that without the exceptions, they will lose the race for dominance to China.\nHollywood filmmakers say tech companies are attempting to undermine the entertainment industry, which they point out supports more than 2.3 million US jobs.\n\"We firmly believe that America's global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries,\" a group of more than 400 Hollywood A-listers - led by actress/writer Natasha Lyonne who helped develop Moonvalley - wrote in an open letter to the Trump administration, which has been soliciting public comment for its AI Action Plan.\nThe letter's signatories included A-List stars like Ben Stiller, Paul McCartney, Cate Blanchett and Lilly Wachowski, who co-created \"The Matrix,\" which depicts a dystopian simulated reality where humans are enslaved by intelligent machines.\nMany in Hollywood remain terrified of what AI means for their futures.\nOutside a Disney Character Voices office earlier this month, dozens of actors picketed against video game companies for refusing to come to an agreement on using AI in video games.\n\"Using actual actors is the key to a lot of the drama and enjoyment that people get from video games,\" actor DW McCann said. \"People have lived experiences that AI just can't understand.\"\nThe actors want a contract that guarantees their voices and likeness will not be used without their consent to train AI models that replace them in the future. \nMr Mooser says AI will allow filmmakers to create amazing art \u2013 if it's done right.  With humans calling the shots, he says, AI could help them create sets and worlds they couldn't easily access or invent \u2013 and to do so much faster than what they could traditionally do with computer graphics and visual effects.\n\"We're trying to say look, technology is going to be in everything. Let's make sure that we try to fight as hard as we can to make sure that it's done in the right way, and that artists aren't run over by big companies.\"",

        "article_text": "As Ukrainian cities are bombed almost nightly by Russia, the idea of holding elections here might seem fanciful.\nBut in the streets and offices of the capital, Kyiv, the prospect of the country going to the polls is once again being discussed.\nElection rumours have come and gone in the three long years of Russia's full-scale war.\nEach time they have been dismissed by government, opposition and public alike, arguing unity of effort against the Russian invader must come first.\nA presidential election due in 2024 was suspended in line with martial law, which was introduced in Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion two years earlier.\nBut that hasn't stopped the Kremlin from claiming President Volodymyr Zelensky is an illegitimate leader and demanding new elections as a condition of a ceasefire deal \u2013 a talking point which has been repeated by President Trump.\nNow there has been a fresh flurry of speculation that Zelensky might just be thinking again as ceasefire talks proceed, and some sources speaking to the BBC suggest there are reasons to think elections could go ahead later this year.\nThe president's potential closest rival, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, former commander in chief of Ukraine's army, has felt the need to deny rumours about his intentions.\n\"My answer to this has not changed,\" he told the RBC-Ukraine news agency. \"While the war continues, we all need to work to save the country, not think about elections. I don't comment on any rumours.\"\nThat the publicity-shy Zaluzhnyi, currently Ukraine's ambassador in London, felt the need to issue a statement was striking in itself.\nThe head of Ukraine's Central Election Commission, Oleh Didenko, also chose to speak publicly about the speculation.\nHe told the Ukrainska Pravda news website the law would have to be changed before any elections could take place. He said current rules stated that parliamentary elections must be held 60 days after the lifting of martial law, and 90 days for presidential elections. \nBut more time would be needed because of the war and that would require legal changes.\nThe Economist newspaper claimed Zelensky held a meeting last week to discuss an election and instructed staff to prepare for a vote once the United States had forced Russia into accepting a ceasefire, potentially as early as Easter.\nThis report was denied by several government sources. \n\"There is fake information there,\" one presidential source told BBC News Ukrainian. \"There was no such meeting and there was no such instruction.\"\nThe government source said the main focus was achieving peace and there was little hope of the war ending by Easter.\nSo in the face of so many public denials, why do some still think an election might be in the offing?\nFirst, some sources note Zelensky's support in the polls has picked up since he was harangued by Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in the White House. \nA poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) in March suggested the number of Ukrainians who trusted Zelensky was up a couple of points on the previous month at 69%. \nDiplomats say the president might think now was his best chance of winning a second term rather than wait until political divisions emerge after the war.\nSecond, by winning a second term, Zelensky would call Russia's bluff and strengthen his hand in any long-term peace negotiations. Only last week President Vladimir Putin said the United Nations should take over Ukraine and organise a \"democratic presidential election\". His assumption \u2013 perhaps mistaken - is that Zelensky would be replaced.\nThird, martial law must be renewed by parliamentary vote in early May. Zelensky could use that timetable to announce martial law would be allowed to lapse with elections held later in the summer.\nFourth, the Americans are convinced elections are coming. Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, told the Tucker Carlson podcast on March 21: \"They've agreed to it. There will be elections in Ukraine.\" \nZelensky could use this pressure from the US \u2013 echoing Russian narratives \u2013 as a pretext, telling voters he had no choice but to hold elections.\nFifth, some Ukrainian sources believe logistical obstacles to elections can be overcome. \nMillions of citizens are displaced overseas, on the front line and in occupied territories. The answer to that, some say, is to allow people to vote using a smart phone app called Diia. This contains people's core documents such as passport, identity card and drivers' licence. \nUsing Diia, some argue, would allow people to vote quickly, cheaply and safely without having to travel to a polling booth overseas or in the trenches. They point out Ukrainians have used it successfully to vote in the Eurovision Song Contest. They also note President Zelensky gave every Ukrainian almost \u00a320 as a winter allowance last December, with many registering for it using Diia.\nBut there remain many arguments against elections. \nUsing Diia would require new legislation that might struggle to get through parliament. Diia could be vulnerable to cyber-attack and technical failure. Western governments may not consider it trustworthy; Russia certainly would not. \nEven if Diia were used, identifying who could vote would still take time with incomplete and out-of-date registers. \nLifting martial law during a temporary ceasefire could create unexpected consequences \u2013 including the flight of hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the front line \u2013 just as Russia prepared a counterattack. Russia could strike queues of voters at polling stations. \nAny elections, however quickly held, would allow war-time unity to be replaced by political rows. An election would allow Russia to deploy digital and other propaganda to try to shape the result. \nHolding an election may also be seen as accepting Russian arguments that Volodymyr Zelensky's leadership is illegitimate because of the suspended elections last year. \nPerhaps the strongest argument against elections is that Ukrainians themselves do not want them. That same March poll by the KIIS found about 78% of people opposed holding elections even after a complete settlement of the war.",

        "article_text": "Richard Chamberlain, who has died today at the age of 90, shot to fame as TV heartthrob Dr Kildare in the 1960s.\nHis dashing good looks won him legions of female fans, and guaranteed him work in a plethora of rather forgettable television movies.\nBut, in middle age, his career spiked again.\nChamberlain became king of the 1980's TV mini-series: playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.\nHe denied being gay when confronted by a French magazine in 1989, and did not speak publicly about his homosexuality until he turned 70.\nIn interviews promoting his 2003 memoir, he advised other handsome leading actors to keep their sexuality to themselves.\n\"There's still a tremendous amount of homophobia in our culture,\" he said. \"Please, don't pretend that we're suddenly all wonderfully, blissfully accepted.\"\nGeorge Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.\nHis salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".\nHe admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics. \nAt Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.\nParamount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.\nOn his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.\nNot everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.\nHe was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".\nBut, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama. \n\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"\nThe series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.\nIt broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.\nThere was a huge reaction from female fans.\nChamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name. \nThe studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.\nFans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems. \nAnd Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.\nHe won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.\nNow an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind. \nIn 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.\nAudiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage. \nHe got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.\nThe production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.' \nIn 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.\nAnd, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.\nThis time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark. \nBut Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson. \nThe critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.\nChamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.\nHe also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building. \nIn 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.\nIt sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.\nHe beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.\nThe series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.  \nHaving won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing for the actress, Rachel Ward.\nIt was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.\nIn the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.\nThere were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.\nThese included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.\nIn 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.\nDespite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.\n\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"\nChamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.\nIn later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace. \nHe continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.\nBut he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.\n\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"\nHe will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.\nDespite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.\nFor, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience.",

He's had the support of a lot of people, my horses have been very consistent all year and he's had very good jockeys chasing him down in the championship to keep him honest and hungry. But he fully deserves to be where he is. \n\"His dedication is not in doubt. And he's been riding out of his skin.\"\nWhile Bowen leads the jockeys title race, the ever improving Murphy is fifth in the trainers list, external (which is based on prize money not winners) - but only his Warwickshire neighbour Dan Skelton (158) has sent out more winners than his own season's best of 125. \nIn a campaign when the Welshman has also passed 1,000 career winners, he is grateful for the role Bowen has played.\n\"He's been a big part of my rise as a trainer over the last couple of years,\" added Murphy. \"His work ethic is second to none - and his feedback on a day-to-basis is fantastic.\n\"You have to have a good working relationship with a jockey - and it's particularly important having a good stable jockey.\n\"I believe Sean brings the best out of me and I bring out the best of him. We work very closely together. He's very much involved in everything that goes on at Warren Chase.\"\nOlly Murphy spent four years working for Irish trainer Gordon Elliott before opting to branch out on his own close to his mother Annabel's stables in Warwickshire \nWhile Murphy does not have a runner in this Saturday's National, he has Bowen on board Strong Leader at Aintree in the race before, defending their Liverpool Hurdle crown from a year ago.\n\"I love Aintree,\" said Murphy. \"If we didn't have another winner this season, I'd take it if we could have another one at Liverpool. It was my first festival winner.\"\nAnd he hopes there is a lot more still more to come from his growing yard, just outside Stratford.\n\"There are a lot of good trainers in England and it's a ruthless sport. We just need that little step up to where Nicky Henderson, Paul Nicholls and Dan Skelton are.\n\"I'm still making mistakes but, with a little more experience under my belt, I still believe in doing things in a better manner. I'm delighted with how things are going. We're fifth in the trainers table, have the best strike rate of any of the top 50 and only Dan has trained more winners than me.\n\"But I want to get better and climb that table again. We want to get more horses, even better horses and to improve on this next year. Come Sandown on 26 April, we're all back to zero and then it will be time to get rock'n'rolling again.\"",

        "article_text": "Richard Chamberlain, who has died today at the age of 90, shot to fame as TV heartthrob Dr Kildare in the 1960s.\nHis dashing good looks won him legions of female fans, and guaranteed him work in a plethora of rather forgettable television movies.\nBut, in middle age, his career spiked again.\nChamberlain became king of the 1980's TV mini-series: playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.\nHe denied being gay when confronted by a French magazine in 1989, and did not speak publicly about his homosexuality until he turned 70.\nIn interviews promoting his 2003 memoir, he advised other handsome leading actors to keep their sexuality to themselves.\n\"There's still a tremendous amount of homophobia in our culture,\" he said. \"Please, don't pretend that we're suddenly all wonderfully, blissfully accepted.\"\nGeorge Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.\nHis salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".\nHe admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics. \nAt Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.\nParamount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.\nOn his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.\nNot everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.\nHe was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".\nBut, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama. \n\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"\nThe series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.\nIt broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.\nThere was a huge reaction from female fans.\nChamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name. \nThe studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.\nFans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems. \nAnd Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.\nHe won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.\nNow an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind. \nIn 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.\nAudiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage. \nHe got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.\nThe production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.' \nIn 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.\nAnd, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.\nThis time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark. \nBut Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson. \nThe critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.\nChamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.\nHe also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building. \nIn 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.\nIt sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.\nHe beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.\nThe series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.  \nHaving won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing afor the actress, Rachel Ward.\nIt was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.\nIn the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.\nThere were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.\nThese included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.\nIn 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.\nDespite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.\n\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"\nChamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.\nIn later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace. \nHe continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.\nBut he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.\n\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"\nHe will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.\nDespite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.\nFor, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience.",

        "article_text": "Anthony Elanga believes he is benefiting from regular football at Nottingham Forest\nAnthony Elanga had left Manchester United in the past. On Tuesday, they trailed in his wake.\nAlejandro Garnacho and Patrick Dorgu could not keep up with the 22-year-old as he burst from the edge of his own area on to Ryan Yates' defensive header, collected the ball and ran 70 yards.\nThe Sweden winger still had the composure to find the bottom corner from 18 yards.\nA special moment - but he refused to celebrate against the club he joined as a 12-year-old. \nA 1-0 win maintained Forest's relentless quest to reach the Champions League and left them third in the Premier League, with a 10-point lead over Newcastle in sixth. \nBoss Nuno Espirito Santo admitted he had never seen a goal like it, while Forest captain Yates labelled his team-mate a \"midfielder's dream\".\n\"It is about attacking the space and getting to the opposite goal as quick as I can. I saw the space and I believe I'm one of the fastest players in the league,\" Elanga told TNT Sports while holding his man-of-the-match award.\n\"The finish is something I have been trying to work on. Left foot or right foot, I am quite comfortable with both feet this season.\n\"All you want to do is keep on improving. Coming here is about playing and developing. I appreciate Manchester United so much as I learned a lot there.\n\"I am enjoying my football and I want to keep on going.\"\nHis \u00a315m move to Nottingham Forest in 2023 was meant to bring that enjoyment back into his game. \nHe made 55 appearances, scoring four goals, for United but was jettisoned by Erik ten Hag, who felt the winger wasn't going to make the grade. That came after just five Premier League starts in 2022-23. \nInterestingly, though, current United boss Ruben Amorim played down the fact that Elanga was allowed to leave.\nHe said: \"We are talking about a lot of players who were at Manchester United who are doing right, but they had the chance here. At United, you don't have the time. I will not have the time. We have to get it right fast.\n\"They were here and here the pressure is too big sometimes. Sometimes you don't have time and you should have time for these kids to develop. \n\"For that you need a strong base. If you don't have it, we are not going to help our kids. They had their chances and sometimes the pressure playing for Manchester United is really big.\" \nThere are clearly no regrets from Elanga, though, whose six-goal return is a season's best. \n\"I made the right decision, 100%,\" Elanga told the Athletic in December. \"I have not really spoken about this, but at the time at United, I was very young and I was coming into a team that was struggling. \n\"Yes, there was the thought that 'I am playing for Manchester United'. But I also never felt as though I was improving. I was playing for the sake of playing when I did get the odd opportunity off the bench.\n\"Coming to Forest was so big for me, because suddenly I was regularly playing 90 minutes, while having the opportunity to improve. When I played, I felt like I had purpose; like I was playing and improving in the process. That was the biggest change for me.\n\"I feel as though I know the league inside-out now, because I have had the chance to learn. I have no regrets, because I am enjoying playing fantastic football with this team. We are in a really good place at the moment.\"\nThat place has only got better after a deserved win over United pushed them closer to a fairytale finale this season, with an FA Cup semi final against Manchester City part of it.\nWith eight games remaining, they are closing in on the Champions League. \nElanga has played his part with his goals and eight assists, for which he is joint-seventh in the Premier League standings. And he's quick: Before Tuesday's game, the stats showed he had spent 1.17% of his time on the pitch this season sprinting - a Premier League high.\nAfter Tuesday's goal, that figure will undoubtedly have improved. \nAs Nuno said of his matchwinner: \"He did it by himself. There is no better counter-attack. He is a special player.\"\nForest boost chances as Champions League race intensifies\nAlmost a saviour - is makeshift striker Maguire sign of Man Utd struggles?\nAnalysis by Simon Stone, chief football news reporter\nRalf Rangnick, arriving at Old Trafford to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in December 2021, quickly concluded Anthony Elanga had a bright future.\nRangnick clearly knew Elanga had pace - and felt his direct style was a threat to opposition defences, which in turn could create space for others.\nCrucially, he also felt Elanga was aware of the space around him and didn't forget his defensive duties, even if his preference was to go forward.\nThat he featured in 26 out of Rangnick's 29 games in charge says it all about the current Austria coach's view.\nSadly for Elanga, Erik ten Hag had a different outlook.\nThe Dutchman did not feel Elanga had the quality needed to be enough of an influence on his squad.\nThat meant he was jettisoned in 2023 after a single campaign under the Dutchman.\nThe problem was the attacking players who came in the same summer \u2013 Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund \u2013 have failed to deliver. The wide attacking players United already had \u2013 Antony, Amad Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho \u2013 were inconsistent at best, Anthony Martial was injured and Marcus Rashford's form fell off a cliff.\nTen Hag's assessment was probably right. United were third then, as Forest are third now. Maybe that is Elanga's level. What he really did not bargain for was the Old Trafford side hurtling backwards at such an alarming rate. Third to them now seems light years away.",

        "article_text": "Our lives are surprisingly dependent upon this extremely light and unreactive gas, yet supplies of it are remarkably fragile.\nNancy Washton remembers the sinking feeling she got when she heard her helium delivery wouldn't be arriving. In early 2022, she and her team of chemists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in the United States were abruptly told by their supplier that they wouldn't get their usual shipment of the gas, which they use in a range of different experiments.\nShortages meant there wasn't enough to go around, and the laboratory would simply have to make do with less. In the first weeks of that year, the laboratory's supply dropped well below the 2,500 litres (660 gallons) it normally received. By April, just a couple of months later, it was getting less than half the helium it needed.\nWith a small fleet of instruments that require regular top-ups of liquid helium, the lab had no choice but to sacrifice the greediest of these in order to continue running the most important. Washton's own instrument of choice was a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer \u2013 a huge, hulking tower, capable of peering into the molecular structure of atoms. Such measurements can contribute to the development of new batteries and energy storage systems, for example.\nThe spectrometer was the only one of its kind in North America, and less than 12 months after its installation it was providing results that were potentially game-changing. When turned on samples of magnesium oxide, for example, it showed the\u00a0minerals are capable of pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.\u00a0Such \"carbon mineralisation\" has long been explored as a way of combatting greenhouse gas emissions, but the results showed how useful these minerals could be.\n\"There had been no definitive evidence of carbonate formations on these particular types of magnesium oxides [before],\" says Washton.\u00a0\"I just could not believe the data. The fact that we had managed to get this data, and the beauty of the story it told, was just amazing,\" Washton says.\nBut then all of that work abruptly had to stop.\nThe rate at which the spectrometer consumed helium made it a problem. In a process Washton later described as \"traumatising\", the instrument was de-energised and mothballed, its experiments suspended. It would sit inert and useless for several months until more helium could be secured. Today, the device is back up and running \u2013 the lab has the helium it needs. For the time being.\nWhat is helium used for?\nHelium is an inert gas, which means that it does not react readily with other substances. It has the lowest boiling point of any element at -269C (-452F) and a low density.\nThe space industry uses helium to keep satellite instruments cool and to clean out rocket engines. It is also used to pressurise the fuel tanks of space rockets.\nHelium also cools equipment within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well as the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners.\nHelium is often used to fill party balloons, weather balloons and airships due to its low density.\nDeep-sea divers rely on helium to control the proportions of oxygen and nitrogen they get from their breathing apparatus, since this helps to avoid decompression sickness.\nThe episode highlights how vulnerable helium supplies are and why there is now a desperate scramble around the world to find ways of conserving and recycling this crucial gas.\nThe shortages in 2022 didn't just affect researchers. You might not realise it, but many of the products and processes you encounter each day depend on helium.\nHospitals, for example, are the world's largest consumers of helium, accounting for around 32% of the global market. The gas is used to cool magnets in vital diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. Helium is also used in the manufacturing of the semiconductors (computer chips), which are at the heart of electronic devices. It's also used in welding and even pressurises the fuel tanks of rockets that put satellites into orbit. Plus, helium is part of the gas mixture that inflates car safety airbags.\nHelium is odourless, extremely light and, unlike another very light element once used in airships, hydrogen, it will never burst into flames. When cooled, it only condenses into a liquid at the stunningly low temperature of roughly 4.2 Kelvin, or -269C/-452F. Plus, under normal atmospheric conditions, helium will not freeze even at temperatures as low as absolute zero, or 0 Kelvin (-273C/-460F). This makes it incredibly useful.\u00a0\n\"Helium is a magical element,\" says Sophia Hayes, professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis. \"There is nothing else like it in the Universe.\"\nLiquid helium takes on strange properties when it is chilled almost to absolute zero, turning into a superfluid that flows without friction. Stir a cup of superfluid helium and the liquid inside would theoretically keep spinning forever. Superfluid helium has become vital for large-scale superconductors, such as those used by the Large Hadron Collider experiment at Cern on the border between Switzerland and France.\nBut since 2006, helium has repeatedly been in short supply. The most recent extended shortage started in January 2022 before easing the following year. But helium supplies have remained precarious, with producers struggling to keep up with demand.\nThat demand is only expected to rise further \u2013 with some analysts predicting that it will double by 2035 due to helium's key roles in semiconductor and electric vehicle battery manufacturing, as well as in aerospace applications.\nThere are only two sources of helium: the highly-energetic nuclear fusion reactions inside stars, including our Sun, and the slow decay radioactive elements in Earth's crust. Since we can't artificially manufacture helium with today's technology, that means it is essentially a finite resource. Instead, helium is typically mined alongside natural gas by drilling deep wells into the ground, but only a handful of companies across the world currently do this.\nHelium is also a remarkably uncooperative element. The extraction and burning of fossil fuels have caused increasing amounts of helium to build up in the Earth's atmosphere in recent decades, depleting the resource otherwise locked inside our planet.\nBut helium is so light that it is also slowly leaking out of the Earth's atmosphere and heading off into space. In its superfluid state, it has a habit of finding its way out of even the tiniest cracks and holes. It can even flow up walls in this superfluid state. That makes it difficult to handle and store \u2013 it can be easily lost after use.\nAll of this makes the helium supply chain fragile \u2013 resulting in four worldwide helium shortages in the last twenty years alone.\nThe most recent severe shortage in 2022 that scuppered some of Washton's research occurred after a series of fires at a major Russian gas processing plant in the Amur region of Siberia. The war in Ukraine compounded the problem by further choking supplies at the same time a helium plant in Qatar went offline for planned maintenance. Meanwhile, the crude helium enrichment unit at the US National Helium Reserve was shut down during the summer of 2021 and again for four months at the end of January 2022. The US shutdown removed around 10% of the global production capacity of helium from the supply chain. Taken together, these incidents led to a sudden shortage and highlighted just how vulnerable the world's helium supply could be. By 2023, the industrial sale price of helium had nearly doubled from what it was five years before, reaching an all-time high.\nAlthough helium production has since increased, the world yet again faces potential disruption, leaving market prices volatile. In September 2024, the EU began enforcing new sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, including banning imports of helium. While Russia accounts for only 1% of the EU's helium imports, the move marked a further tightening of supplies. On top of that, the sale of the world's largest helium reserve \u2013 the US Federal Helium Reserve \u2013 has triggered further uncertainty.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Why the world is running out of sand\n\u2022\u00a0How Google's ballons surprised their creator\n\u2022\u00a0The world's forgotten greenhouse gas\nFor several decades, the US has supplied around one-tenth of the world's helium from an underground federal stockpile established a century ago near Amarillo, Texas. But in June 2024, the Bureau of Land Management, which ran the US helium reserve, sold the last gasp of federal helium to the German gas supplier Messer. Ahead of the handover, the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine released a report warning that the sale of the strategic reserve to a commercial company could heighten uncertainty in the helium market.\u00a0\nTrade bodies including The Compressed Gas Association and the Advanced Medical Technology Association \u2013 AdvaMed \u2013 urged the US government to delay the sale on the grounds that it risked a \"supply chain crisis\". And healthcare contractor Premier Inc, which sources helium on behalf of thousands of hospitals, suggested the sale could have a detrimental impact on patient care.\u00a0\nAlthough these fears are yet to be realised, there are signs that not all is going smoothly.\nWithin months of the sale, Messer was forced to request a temporary restraining order to prevent another shutdown of the crude helium enrichment unit \u2013 this was due to the expiry of a critical lease and a negotiation dispute. The company that ran the enrichment unit was later placed into receivership. Messer, however, says its helium system \"has been operating reliably and without interruption since we acquired it last June, and we anticipate smooth uninterrupted operations in the future\".\nBut a recent analysis of helium supplies suggests that this natural resource is likely to take on growing geopolitical importance over the coming years as demand and competition for the gas increases.\nThe US accounts for about 46% of the global supply of helium, followed by Qatar (38%) and then Algeria (5%). If US supplies were to be disrupted again, the impact would be felt around the world.\nYears of precarious helium supplies and price fluctuations, however, have also forced academic, commercial and clinical bodies to explore more sustainable modes of helium consumption. Firmly in their crosshairs are helium-hungry MRI machines.\nA standard MRI machine requires a little under 2,000 litres of liquid helium to cool its superconducting magnets. Each unit needs occasional top-ups and, without the cooling helium, its magnets would heat up, evaporate the helium reservoir, and expel it in a process called \"quenching\". It's rare, but dire: the helium is lost, and another couple thousand litres of the liquid is required to put the machine back into working order. If a quenching incident causes more serious damage, then the whole MRI machine might need replacing at great expense.\u00a0\nNow, a new breed of MRI machines that require significantly less helium are emerging. Many of these low-helium units need as little as one litre of helium to operate, sealing it in a closed system. In recent years, these machines have already begun appearing in hospitals and research institutions.\u00a0 \u00a0\nBut there are limits. These low-helium scanners are especially expensive, and it would still take many years to replace the more than 35,000 MRI machines that use superconductors worldwide.\nThe new scanners are also only capable of producing magnetic field strengths of around 1.5 Tesla \u2013 roughly half of what their beefier predecessors can put out. \"Higher-field-strength scanners have the potential to scan in finer detail and/or faster than lower-field-strength scanners,\" says Sharon Giles, director of clinical and research imaging operations at King's College London. The use of these low-helium scanners, then, is limited, although Giles says they're still capable of performing routine imaging in a lab setting.\nOther researchers have searched for ways to cut out helium entirely by developing superconducting materials that don't need to be cooled to such extremes.\nMore widely, researchers are starting to shore up their own supplies by recycling. Helium recovery systems can recapture evaporated helium that would otherwise be lost. \"It will allow us to recover about 90% of the helium that we purchase every year,\" says Nicholas Fitzkee, director of Mississippi State University's nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) facility, which is in the process of installing a recovery system. \"We did the calculations when we wrote the proposal and the total cost of the system was just over $300,000 (\u00a3238,000), and it should pay for itself within six years.\"\nBut installing helium recovery technology \u2013 complicated arrangements of pipes, tubing and headers that must be fed through a facility's instruments \u2013 is time-consuming and complex. These systems can fail, leak, and even when done right, Washton worries that some people may not fully appreciate their benefit. \"To make an argument, 'Hey, I need $600,000 (\u00a3476,000) for a couple of helium recovery units', people are like, 'Well, what's that gonna do for us? That's kind of like you're putting in new plumbing',\" she says, explaining that such work doesn't have the \"bling\" factor that helps justify certain other scientific investments.\nBut there may also be some signs of relief on the horizon. Qatar is on course to open a new helium plant by 2027, while other companies have started to look for previously untapped underground fields.\nIn 2016, the world's largest helium reserve was found in Tanzania. It is set to start production in 2025. This was actually the first helium gas field to be discovered deliberately, and the launch of operations there will mark the first time helium has been recovered at scale, rather than as a by-product of polluting natural gas extraction. Major helium reserves have also been discovered in China's Bohai Bay Basin.\nChristopher Ballentine, chair of geochemistry at the University of Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences, contributed to the scientific research that ultimately helped to locate the Tanzanian helium deposit. But he cautions against over-excitement. \"The challenge of finding significant helium deposits to meet the growing global demand requires significant finances and a long lead-in time,\" he says.\nVolatile supplies in recent years have reminded everyone just how exhaustible this precious resource is \u2013 and how quickly its supply can be pinched off.\nWashton emphasises the risks: \"Imagine if there's just not enough helium, and your grandma can't get her MRI because its superconductor is dead. This is serious and we need to deal with it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "summary": "Messer, however, says its helium system \"has been operating reliably and without interruption since we acquired it last June, and we anticipate smooth uninterrupted operations in the future\".But a recent analysis of helium supplies suggests that this natural resource is likely to take on growing geopolitical importance over the coming years as demand and competition for the gas increases.The US accounts for about 46% of the global supply of helium, followed by Qatar (38%) and then Algeria (5%). On top of that, the sale of the world's largest helium reserve \u2013 the US Federal Helium Reserve \u2013 has triggered further uncertainty.More like this:\u2022\u00a0Why the world is running out of sand\u2022\u00a0How Google's ballons surprised their creator\u2022\u00a0The world's forgotten greenhouse gasFor several decades, the US has supplied around one-tenth of the world's helium from an underground federal stockpile established a century ago near Amarillo, Texas. It is also used to pressurise the fuel tanks of space rockets.Helium also cools equipment within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well as the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners.Helium is often used to fill party balloons, weather balloons and airships due to its low density.Deep-sea divers rely on helium to control the proportions of oxygen and nitrogen they get from their breathing apparatus, since this helps to avoid decompression sickness.The episode highlights how vulnerable helium supplies are and why there is now a desperate scramble around the world to find ways of conserving and recycling this crucial gas.The shortages in 2022 didn't just affect researchers. If US supplies were to be disrupted again, the impact would be felt around the world.Volatile supplies in recent years have reminded everyone just how exhaustible this precious resource isYears of precarious helium supplies and price fluctuations, however, have also forced academic, commercial and clinical bodies to explore more sustainable modes of helium consumption.

It's obviously a dangerous sport - you don't want to mess yourself up. Getting down after a good run is the most mind-blowing feeling.\"\nWith the shackles off, Bramwell began his descent of Verbier's Bec des Rosses with an audacious backflip over an exposed rocky outcrop, then navigated a breakneck passage through a narrow gully, hurtling through a cascading shower of falling snow before ending with a soaring 360-degree jump.\nJudges score each competitor on the difficulty of the line they choose down the mountain, the fluidity, control and technique shown in their run and the style of their jumps, as well as the amount of time they spend in the air.\nBramwell claimed victory in Verbier with an impressive score of 92.67 out of 100, and moved from rock bottom after three events to finish the season in second place overall.\n\"Winning the whole tour would have been amazing, but at least now we have some more chances,\" added Bramwell. \"The Xtreme Verbier is the most legendary freeride competition, so to win that for the first time is the biggest dream ever.\"\nThe Briton is now looking forward to a much brighter future, and the potential to one day step on to an Olympic podium.\nThat possibility is by no means assured, but FIS told BBC Sport that it was finalising documents to put forward freeride as an Olympic discipline for the 2030 Winter Games, with the International Olympic Committee due to make a decision in December.\nFIS secretary general Michel Vion said: \"From FIS' standpoint, freeride clearly meets all the evaluation criteria, including a strong position on promoting sustainability and environmental responsibility.

Now we need to deal with the fact that this should not have happened\".\n\"I don't think we should rest on the fact that nothing bad happened this time,\" she said. \n\"We don't know whether that communications path has been penetrated. So we don't know whether the state actors that have lots of resources are just sitting and working now.\"\nThose concerns have led many Democrats to call for greater accountability, with Mark Warner, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying that if a military officer or CIA agent had treated classified information in a similar manner they \"would be fired - end of story\".\n\"I believe Secretary Hegseth should resign or be fired,\" he told CBS News on Sunday. \"I think Mike Waltz should resign or be fired. If no action is taken, what message does that send to the workforce?\" \nTrump had told NBC News a day before that he would not fire anyone involved in the group chat, and that he still had confidence in Waltz.\n\"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" he said.\nAlong with Waltz and Hegseth, the chat also included Vice-President JD Vance, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and other senior leaders.

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nPundits on Rashford's MOTM performance against Preston\nMarcus Rashford has got his swagger back.\nThe Aston Villa loanee ended his 120-day goal drought with a second-half double at Preston on Sunday to help Unai Emery's side set up an FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace - and provide another clear sign he is enjoying his football again.\nFrozen out of the first-team picture at Manchester United by head coach Ruben Amorim just weeks after he replaced Erik ten Hag at the helm, even those closest to Rashford accepted he had a major point to prove when he completed his loan move to Aston Villa on 3 February.\nThose working with him can see the improvement in Rashford, maybe not quite to the levels of old but certainly a far cry from the passive figure he appeared at Old Trafford for most of the previous 18 months.\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel must have felt so too, judging by the speed with which he restored Rashford to the international fold earlier this month.\nYet there were plenty of doubters. They were out in force on social media during the first half of Villa's 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory at Preston, as Rashford wasted a couple of free-kicks as the visitors struggled to turn their dominance into goals.\nThe only measure, though, of a striker's success is the regularity they hit the back of the net - and he hadn't done it for 14 games and counting since his double for United against Everton on 1 December.\nBut when Lucas Digne presented the opportunity 13 minutes into the second half at Deepdale, Rashford's innate ability did the rest as he calmly picked his spot before finding the bottom corner. \nFive minutes later, despite a wait for the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm Villa should be awarded a penalty, and goalkeeper David Cornell offering some 'advice' as he walked past to take up his position, Rashford's nerve held. He took his time, did an extended stuttering run-up, and found the net.\n\"The swagger is back,\" gushed Guy Mowbray in his Match of the Day commentary. \"The confidence and the pose.\"\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Rashford told BBC Sport afterwards: \"It's always nice for a forward to get a goal, so hopefully it continues.\n\"I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. I missed a lot of football before joining up with them. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now.\"\nFA Cup 'sparkle' returns - but will there be a 'fairytale ending'?\nRashford scores double as Aston Villa beat Preston in FA Cup quarters\nForest draw Bournemouth or Man City, Palace v Villa\nThis video can not be played\nRashford scores first Villa goals within space of five minutes\nThe deal United struck with Villa to let Rashford leave is not straightforward.\nThe precise nature of the loan deal is complicated. United have said 75% of Rashford's wages are being covered, although they have not explained exactly how. \nThat could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.\nThat, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League - Villa have been paired with French heavyweights Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals - as well as the FA Cup.\nUnai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957. \nIn addition, they are ninth in the Premier League, three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City, who occupy what is virtually certain to be the final Champions League spot.\nThat proliferation of targets underscores why Emery did not really want to talk about the likelihood of Villa triggering their \u00a340m option to turn Rashford's move into a permanent deal.\n\"We can't waste time speaking about that,\" he said\n\"If next year we are in the Champions League, in the Europa, or Conference League or not. Or we don't win a trophy - it is completely different.\"\nMarcus Rashford (left) celebrates his second goal for Aston Villa at Preston\nUnlike Villa, Rashford has won the FA Cup twice in recent memory, including last season. He has also been part of teams who have won the Europa League and EFL Cup. In addition, he has 60 England caps. His past playbook means if he can reach the standards he has previously set, he would be an asset to any side in the world.\nIt is that talent Emery is trying to coax out of the player. It is, in the modern football vocabulary, 'a process'.\nThe Aston Villa boss, said: \"There is still work, still weeks to get it, but today he did one step forward. He is feeling comfortable, getting confident and scoring goals. He was obviously getting better, but today it was more in his adaptation and helping us.\n\"He's playing in the idea, in the plan we did with him. He has played more as a winger on the left side but he's played in some moments as a striker. Today we decided to play him as a striker to his quality, his power and the way he exploits things. \n\"The process we have with him is more or less not changing. There is still work to do because he came here after not training consistently and not feeling in his best fitness. Progressively playing more and with the national team will help him to feel better and today was confirmation of that, which is good.\"\nThe painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nThe good thing from Rashford's perspective is he is beginning to put together a positive body of work to counter the extended period of drift he experienced at United.\nIt still feels bizarre he has left his boyhood club for a perceived smaller rival, yet finds himself entering the final two months of the campaign with substantially more to play for - both in number and prestige of competitions - than he would have had if he remained at Old Trafford.\nNo professional career is a straight line ascent, which is why insight from those who have been there and done it is so valuable.\n\"You are constantly being asked questions at the top,\" said former England keeper Joe Hart on Match of the Day.\n\"Maybe Rashford found himself in a lull but he has come to Villa with people around him that know what they are doing. He hasn't come here with question marks about how he is going to behave and what he is going to do and how he can change the team.\"\nHart found himself frozen out for a time at Manchester City and Micah Richards did not have the greatest time at Aston Villa.\nBut, like Hart, Rashford can see how a change of scenery has provided the impetus for improvement.\n\"He looks confident and happy,\" said Richards.\n\"It was a big move going to Villa. But when you've got a manager that believes in you, you can do special things.\n\"His whole body language looks a lot better and his all-round game was brilliant. That is the best way to shut people up. People were asking questions about not fulfilling his potential but that is the way to answer.\n\"I really like Rashford in these wide areas because he's always looking to run in behind.\nWhen I talk about body language and his movement - his all round game today was brilliant.\"\nGet Aston Villa news sent straight to your phone",

The all up weight is 750kg but 240kg of that are batteries so all the structure is carbon fibre to keep it as light as possible,\" Dr Brooks says.\nSafety is an important part of the design too.  \nThe large wings help it to glide in the event of power failure and there are two motors at the end of each wing so that if one fails the other can compensate.\nIt is also equipped with an emergency ballistic parachute to bring the aircraft and passengers down safely.\nAs well as being safer and cleaner than conventional aircraft, Michael Thompson, Skyfly's chief executive, says electric models are significantly quieter too.\n\"When you're taking off, you're no longer annoying everyone around you from a noise perspective, so I do think electric propulsion brings not only environmental benefits but from a noise pollution point of view, it's a huge benefit as well,\" he says.\nOther eVTOLs under development include those looking to provide an electric flying-taxi service like Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (VA) .  \nVA, as well as Archer and Joby in the US, are designing electric powered aircraft to carry up to four passengers.\nSkyfly's Axe, by comparison, is more compact and aimed at the private market.\nThe do-it-youself kit-plane comes with a price tag of \u00a3250,000.\nIt is aimed at existing pilots who want to transition away from diesel piston engines.\nJason Pritchard, executive editor of eVTOL Insights, says it is also likely to appeal to flying clubs in order to train new members:\n\"The eVTOL aircraft industry is still in its infancy with initial operations a few years away, but it also needs to train large numbers of pilots in the coming years,\" he says.\n\"Additionally, the Axe's design can also train pilots with the skills and controls necessary to land an aircraft without power, which is a necessary tool.\"\nWhile the Axe can be charged up overnight with a conventional three-pin plug, just like EV cars, electric aircraft will need the charging infrastructure to be scaled up.  \nAerovolt, based in West Sussex, has installed rapid chargers at seven UK airports with 40 more in the pipeline.\nIts founder, Philip Kingsley-Dobson, says demand is growing. \n\"A lot of piston aircraft can't use leaded fuel in the future so they're looking for alternatives and ways we can decarbonise the lower end of aviation,\" he says.\nThere are no eVTOL aircraft currently permitted to fly in the UK.\nSkyfly's Axe has successfully completed manned test flights in both hover and forward flight modes but still needs to be certified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).\nWith 40 pre-orders from buyers all over the world, the company hopes to deliver the new model to customers early next year.\nA CAA spokesperson said: \"We are working with innovators to test and fly brand new forms of aviation that keeps the UK at the cutting edge of flight technology and supports the sector to grow.\n\"New technology comes with new challenges and safety remains our priority in all this work.\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

        "article_text": "Gates and Paul Allen launched computing giant Microsoft 50 years ago. In 1993, he talked to the BBC about the online innovations that would define the 21st Century.\nWhen the BBC first broadcast an interview with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in June 1993, there were thought to be only 130 websites in total. The BBC's venerable science programme Horizon was investigating the new \"Electronic Frontier\", in an era where \"information is starting to redefine our world, its geography and its economy\". Gates told the programme: \"This is the information age, and the computer is the tool of the information age and software is what will determine how easily we can get at all of that information.\" Viewers could send off a cheque for \u00a32 and receive a transcript of the programme in the post.\u00a0\nThe computer industry had already grown faster than any in history, but the key to future profits was creating something portable and user-friendly. The programme asked: \"Do we need endless information, or do they just need to sell it to us?\" In a world where a list of almost every website could fit on two sides of a sheet of paper, the world wide web did not even get a mention. However, the ideas explored in the programme are often far ahead of their time.\nIn the early days of Microsoft, Bill Gates and Paul Allen set a goal of having a computer on every desk and in every home \u2013 all running Microsoft products, of course. They first met as children at a private school in Seattle, where they discovered a shared love of computers. Both went on to college but dropped out and created Microsoft, so-called because it provided microcomputer software.\u00a0\nThe company's big break came in 1980 when Microsoft agreed to produce the operating system for the personal computer being developed by IBM, the world's leading computer company at the time. In a stroke of business genius, Microsoft was allowed to license the operating system to other manufacturers, spawning an industry of \"IBM-compatible\" personal computers which depended on its MS-DOS product. The money had begun to roll in \u2013 and to this day it has not yet stopped.\nWhile Gates was the serious-minded computer nerd, Allen was his offbeat big brother. Allen worked at Microsoft until 1983, stepping away from the frontline following a diagnosis of blood cancer. He recovered to become a successful venture capitalist and, having held onto his share of the company, he was a fixture on the world's rich lists until his death in 2018 at the age of 65. He used his vast fortune to invest in his personal passions, owning both the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team and Seattle Seahawks NFL team, who won the Super Bowl in 2013.\nHis departure from Microsoft also meant that he had more time to perfect his guitar moves. Legendary music producer Quincy Jones even claimed in a magazine interview that Allen \"sings and plays just like Hendrix\". He said: \"I went on a trip on his yacht, and he had David Crosby, Joe Walsh, Sean Lennon... then on the last two days, Stevie Wonder came on with his band and made Paul come up and play with him \u2013 he's good, man.\" The design of Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture, which he founded, has been likened to a smashed guitar and was created by superstar architect Frank Gehry.\nAllen jumped ship from Microsoft before products such as Windows, Excel and Word ever made it into the world's homes and offices. By the early 1990s, Gates' vision for networked computers sent sales and profits soaring. However, the pair's early dream of putting a computer running Microsoft software in every home and business was only half complete. Word processing and spreadsheets were lucrative, but Microsoft's relentless drive to expand needed new worlds to explore. The next step was to bring multimedia into people's homes, turning the personal computer into a communication device. It was the world of leisure so beloved by Allen that Gates needed to tap into.\nGates acknowledged to the BBC in 1993 that \"the home will be a tougher frontier to conquer\". However, he was confident that Microsoft would succeed. \"If you take a time frame like 15 years or certainly 20 years, I have no doubt that the vision of a computer in every home, although it won't look like today's computer, will absolutely be achieved,\" he said.\nA year earlier, Bruce Springsteen had a hit grumbling about having \"57 Channels (And Nothin' On)\". Undeterred by the Boss's cynicism, Microsoft's Nathan Myhrvold talked of a future where we would have up to 1,000 television channels. He said: \"That might sound like a nightmare, but I think it's a wonderful thing. Imagine what your favourite bookstore would be like if there were only five books.\" Describing a system resembling today's streaming services, he spoke of an \"online interactive guide, which uses computer technology to organise the channels, show them to you by topic, even learn of the material that you like to watch, and then present it to you in an online fashion right on the television\".\nIn History\nIn History is a series which uses the BBC's unique audio and video archive to explore historical events that still resonate today. Subscribe to the accompanying weekly newsletter.\nMyhrvold was providing a tantalising glimpse of the future: a world at your fingertips where you could order an En Vogue CD or Prince tickets instantly. But what would this mean for personal privacy?\nThere was a warning in the 1993 programme from Denise Caruso, editor of the magazine Digital Media: \"The ease of sitting in front of your interactive TV five years hence and being able to order something by pushing your remote control means information about you is going through a network. That means that whoever is on the other end of that network knows what you're watching on television, can get your credit card number, can know lots of things about you that maybe you don't want them to know.\"\nCaruso raised issues echoed in the current debate about Generative AI models being trained by devouring copyrighted material. She said: \"By making information a commodity, you really change the nature of how people think about ideas and their work and what they do. I am a writer. My stock in trade is ideas, and when you try to draw lines around what information is and where did an idea come from and who had that idea originally and what napkin was it originally drawn on, when you start moving information into that realm, it starts to get very fuzzy about where one person's idea stops and another one starts.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0A 36-year-old Jeff Bezos talks about 'unprofitable' Amazon\n\u2022\u00a0The rocky 1960s origins of online dating\n\u2022\u00a0How Russia launched a giant space mirror in 1993\nShe said that while information was an incredible commodity, it had no value at all unless it could be protected. But how could you protect something that has no physical existence and could be copied or changed undetectably?\n\"The problem is that the solutions are as complex as the problems themselves. Do you want to lock up all the information? Absolutely not. We would have no scientific progress if scientists weren't able to freely exchange ideas and information. Do you just have a free-for-all and say all information is free? Well, you can't do that either because people do actually make their livings upon the fruit of their work, [which] is information, whether it's a book or it's a movie or it's music. I think technology is an incredible thing and it's very powerful, but it's powerful in both ways, and it's very important that we all understand that before we just embrace it.\"\u00a0\nWhile the world wide web did not feature in the programme, it was many viewers' first introduction to the concept of electronic mail, or email. As Microsoft continued its voracious expansion, the company's human resources vice-president Mike Murray said that email \"creates an electronic village [which] allows us to transcend the borders of time or geographic barriers\". His words may seem grandiose now, but at the time it would have been a revolutionary idea that one could communicate instantly with someone or many people on the other side of the world without the need for an expensive international phone call.\nBy the end of 1993, the number of websites was estimated at 623, having doubled every three months. By the end of 1994, the figure was 10,022. Microsoft was seen by some commentators as being slow to acknowledge the possibilities and growth of the web, but in May 1995 Gates sent a memo to his senior staff titled \"The Internet Tidal Wave\", calling it \"the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981\".\u00a0Three months later, Microsoft launched its web portal MSN alongside the release of Windows 95. Some versions had its brand-new Internet Explorer browser controversially bundled in. The future was again up for grabs, and Gates once again had some big thoughts on how he might conquer it.\n--\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0In History newsletter, while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights\u00a0twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Harry Maguire took more shots (three) against Nottingham Forest than Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund combined (zero)\nWith Manchester United trailing 1-0 to Nottingham Forest and needing a goal to avoid a 13th defeat of the season, manager Ruben Amorim turned to the bench.\nHe had already withdrawn Joshua Zirkzee - scorer of three league goals since completing a \u00a336.5m move to Old Trafford last summer - in favour of Rasmus Hojlund, who has contributed 13 league goals since United spent \u00a372m on him in 2023.\nWith other attacking options scarce, Amorim took an approach familiar to coaches at all levels of the game - send on the big man.\nIn fairness, Harry Maguire almost came good as a makeshift striker, his bundled effort in the seventh minute of injury time beating Matz Sels but not fellow centre-back Murillo on the goalline.\nMaguire registered more shots on target during his nine-minute cameo (one) than Zirkzee in 78 (zero) and Hojlund after coming on at the break (zero).\nLittle illustrates United's desperation better than a 32-year-old centre-back being their most threatening weapon in the opposition penalty area.\n\"We tried with good opportunities, but in the last third, the last pass, the last assist wasn't there. Then if we don't have that we cannot score goals,\" Amorim told TNT Sports after the game.\n\"This season is like that. We had a lot of shots on goal, we pushed the opponent to the last third, but in the last third we had a lack of quality.\n\"We know the characters of the [Forest] team and one goal can put them in one situation that they love. We have to score two goals to win a match and that is frustrating as it was the beginning of the game. We helped them to win three points.\"\nGoals are clearly a problem for United - they have scored 37 in 30 league games this season, and are on track to beat their lowest Premier League goals return of 49 set in 2015-16.\nBut goals are far from the only metric that illustrates United's struggles.

Almost a saviour - is makeshift striker Maguire sign of Man Utd struggles?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Harry Maguire took more shots (three) against Nottingham Forest than Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund combined (zero)Alex BrothertonBBC Sport journalistPublished1 April 20251048 CommentsWith Manchester United trailing 1-0 to Nottingham Forest and needing a goal to avoid a 13th defeat of the season, manager Ruben Amorim turned to the bench.He had already withdrawn Joshua Zirkzee - scorer of three league goals since completing a \u00a336.5m move to Old Trafford last summer - in favour of Rasmus Hojlund, who has contributed 13 league goals since United spent \u00a372m on him in 2023.With other attacking options scarce, Amorim took an approach familiar to coaches at all levels of the game - send on the big man.In fairness, Harry Maguire almost came good as a makeshift striker, his bundled effort in the seventh minute of injury time beating Matz Sels but not fellow centre-back Murillo on the goalline.Maguire registered more shots on target during his nine-minute cameo (one) than Zirkzee in 78 (zero) and Hojlund after coming on at the break (zero).Little illustrates United's desperation better than a 32-year-old centre-back being their most threatening weapon in the opposition penalty area. We have to score two goals to win a match and that is frustrating as it was the beginning of the game.",

        "article_text": "Inside a soundstage once used by silent film stars Charlie Chaplin and Mabel Normand, Hollywood executives, actors and filmmakers sipped cocktails as they marvelled at what some say is the biggest breakthrough since the talkies: AI-generated video.\nBut whether AI will be the future, or the end, of cinema is still up for debate.\nIt was only two years ago that actors and writers shut down Hollywood with strikes demanding protections from AI. Now the technology is controversially creeping into TV, movies and video games. Two films honoured at the Oscars even used the technology. \nAs a DJ played '90s hip hop, computer developers rubbed shoulders with actors and executives, in a sign of the changing power players in the industry.\nAI in Hollywood is \"inevitable\", says Bryn Mooser, the party's host and the co-founder of Moonvalley, which created the AI generator tool Marey by paying for footage from filmmakers with their consent. Mooser says that while AI may still be a dirty word, their product is \"clean\" because it pays for its content.\n\"Artists should be at the table,\" he says, adding that it's better to build the tool for filmmakers rather than get \"rolled over by big tech companies\".\nArtificial Intelligence has long been depicted as a villain in Hollywood. In The Terminator, AI used by the US military decides it must destroy everyone on earth.\nBut it's AI's creators, and not the technology itself, that has received the brunt of real-life criticism. Companies use publicly available data to build their AI models - which includes copyrighted material shared online - and creators say they're being ripped off.\nOpenAI, Google and other tech companies are facing multiple lawsuits from writers, actors and news organisations, alleging their work was stolen to train AI without their consent. Studios like Paramount, Disney and Universal who own the copyright on movies and TV shows have been urged by writers to do the same, though none have taken legal action.\n\"We've all fought very hard for copyright laws, and nobody wants to see their work stolen to have somebody else profit from it,\" Mooser says. \nHollywood has begun toying with the new technology. The Oscar-nominated films Emilia Perez and The Brutalist used AI to alter voices. Adrian Brody won the Academy Award for best actor, even with the help of AI to fine tune his accent when he spoke Hungarian in his starring role in The Brutalist. AI has even been used to de-age actors like Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford.\nThe technology is seemingly everywhere. OpenAI hosted an AI film festival in Los Angeles earlier this month. Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo told the Wall Street Journal they plan to invest $400 million to craft AI tools for filmmakers.\nBut the impacts on how it will alter the future of the entertainment industry remain unclear. Generative AI, for instance, allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human \u2013 albeit much faster. And many worry about the technology replacing their jobs as AI is used to generate scripts, animation, locations, voices and human actors.\nIf you ask OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, which Hollywood jobs are most easily replaced by AI, background actors are top of the list as \"most vulnerable\" with \"A-List actors & directors\" considered safest because \"star power and brand recognition keep top talent irreplaceable\".\nAt the Moonvalley party, everyone was talking about new AI technology though few wanted to speak with a reporter on record about it. But dozens of powerful people made the trek east to the hip Silver Lake neighbourhood from west Los Angeles, even though it was raining. In LA, that's remarkable.\n\"We're here to learn,\" said one executive who spent an hour in traffic getting to the party. \"We're not signing anything or buying anything, but we're interested.\"\nMooser and his co-founder Naeem Talukdar speak passionately about how AI will transform Hollywood and allow filmmakers to create blockbuster style epics on much lower budgets. It could lead to many bad films - but it could also help discover the next Quentin Tarantino or Martin Scorsese, even if they don't have the backing of a big studio.\n\"This technology is utterly meaningless without the artist at the centre of it; the technology needs to ultimately be subservient to the artist,\" says Talukdar.\nHollywood's foray into using AI comes as the Trump administration prepares a new AI plan for the United States. \nTech companies say they can't compete with China under existing US copyright laws and that they need unfettered access to art - from Mickey Mouse to Moana to The Matrix - to train their AI models as a matter of national security.\nGoogle and OpenAI want the US government to designate copyrighted art, movies and TV shows as \"fair use\" for them to train AI, arguing that without the exceptions, they will lose the race for dominance to China.\nHollywood filmmakers say tech companies are attempting to undermine the entertainment industry, which they point out supports more than 2.3 million US jobs.\n\"We firmly believe that America's global AI leadership must not come at the expense of our essential creative industries,\" a group of more than 400 Hollywood A-listers - led by actress/writer Natasha Lyonne who helped develop Moonvalley - wrote in an open letter to the Trump administration, which has been soliciting public comment for its AI Action Plan.\nThe letter's signatories included A-List stars like Ben Stiller, Sir Paul McCartney, Cate Blanchett and Lilly Wachowski, who co-created The Matrix, which depicts a dystopian simulated reality where humans are enslaved by intelligent machines.\nMany in Hollywood remain terrified of what AI means for their futures.\nOutside a Disney Character Voices office earlier this month, dozens of actors picketed against video game companies for refusing to come to an agreement on using AI in video games.\n\"Using actual actors is the key to a lot of the drama and enjoyment that people get from video games,\" actor DW McCann said. \"People have lived experiences that AI just can't understand.\"\nThe actors want a contract that guarantees their voices and likeness will not be used without their consent to train AI models that replace them in the future. \nMooser says AI will allow filmmakers to create amazing art \u2013 if it's done right.  With humans calling the shots, he says, AI could help them create sets and worlds they couldn't easily access or invent \u2013 and to do so much faster than what they could traditionally do with computer graphics and visual effects.\n\"We're trying to say, look, technology is going to be in everything. Let's make sure that we try to fight as hard as we can to make sure that it's done in the right way, and that artists aren't run over by big companies.\"",

People are noticing a difference in the heroin when they making it up, saying they are noticing a green tinge to it.\"\nMore paramedics are on their way, she says.\nBoth men are brought round using the overdose reversal drug Naloxone, before being seen by paramedics. The second is taken to hospital.\nLynn Macdonald later told us: \"I am absolutely convinced that had we not been present during the overdoses we've seen within the Thistle, then people would not have survived.\"\nIn the 12 weeks since The Thistle opened in the east end of Glasgow, there have been 16 such overdose incidents.\nA total of 180 people have visited the unit and more than 1,200 injections of street-bought heroin and cocaine have been supervised.\nA total of 27 people have been referred to other services, including housing, by staff.\nThe service, which follows similar programmes in 18 other countries, seeks to reduce drug-related harm in a hardcore population of injecting users in one of the most deprived communities in Glasgow.\nIt is hoped that by providing a safer space it will allow medical staff to prevent overdose deaths, reduce blood-borne viruses and clean-up a local area that, historically, has had a major issue with discarded needles and drug debris.\nDavid Clark has been using drugs for 26 years and has spent long periods of his life on the streets.\nHe allowed BBC Scotland to follow his progress over a three-month period as he attempted to move on from a city centre hostel and stop using heroin and cocaine.\nThe 47-year-old told Disclosure he used The Thistle service to inject cocaine in February.\nFrom there, staff referred him to new supported accommodation. At the time of his interview, he had been abstinent for two weeks.\nHe said: \"When I went [to the consumption room], it wasn't what I expected.\n\"I thought you would go in, do what you're doing and out. But it's not like that.\n\"The members of staff in there supported me and helped me get to where I'm at now.\n\"It's helped me massively. I feel better in myself.\"\nDuring our visit in early March, we met James \u2013 not his real name \u2013 who has been injecting drugs for several years. Now in his mid-20s, he was among the first to attend The Thistle.\nHe says the facility is \"brilliant\".\n\"It's a lot safer. I was going to car parks, the side of the railway tracks, forests \u2013 anywhere I could feel safe enough to do it without getting caught.\"\nHe admitted his drug use in public was dangerous. \"Especially on my own, as well. I have OD'd umpteen times.\"\nThe centre remains controversial in the nearby community of Calton.\nDuring the consultation meetings which were held before the project was given the go-ahead, locals had expressed concerns about the area becoming a drug tolerance zone and fears that it would encourage increased drug dealing in the streets.\nLinda Watson, one of the most vocal residents, said the centre was already attracting more people to the area to use drugs.\nShe took Disclosure on a tour of Calton's known using spots and said there was evidence of freshly discarded needles.\nLinda also expressed anger at a lack of investment in the area.\n\"When we were going to the meetings at first, the drug workers were: 'We are providing a facility for your community, this will make your community better'.\n\"But it's not for people who live in our community. It's for people who come into our community to buy the drugs, take the drugs and leave all this stuff lying around.\n\"Why are they not helping us for this not to have happened in the first place? Why have we just got to accept that this is what this place is going to be like all the time?\n\"Do we not deserve more than that?\"\nDr Saket Priyardarshi, associate medical director of drug services at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said the drug consumption room was not just there to address the health needs of the people using the service.\n\"It will also improve the social environment for communities, residents, businesses and visitors to these areas,\" he said.\n\"The Thistle will hopefully reduce the drug-related death rates for the population that it serves. But that is a relatively small population compared with Scotland as a whole.\n\"Its contribution to the national drug death figures won't be very significant. We have to be honest about that.\"\nDr Priyadarshi said much of the anger emanating from the community related to a lack of resources for other services in the area.\n\"Sometimes I worry that the focus on residential rehab or drug consumption rooms, a focus on debates and discussions about this, takes our eyes off the bigger picture,\" he added.\n\"What are the key drivers here?

        "article_text": "Our lives are surprisingly dependent upon this extremely light and unreactive gas, yet supplies of it are remarkably fragile.\nNancy Washton remembers the sinking feeling she got when she heard her helium delivery wouldn't be arriving. In early 2022, she and her team of chemists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in the United States were abruptly told by their supplier that they wouldn't get their usual shipment of the gas, which they use in a range of different experiments.\nShortages meant there wasn't enough to go around, and the laboratory would simply have to make do with less. In the first weeks of that year, the laboratory's supply dropped well below the 2,500 litres (660 gallons) it normally received. By April, just a couple of months later, it was getting less than half the helium it needed.\nWith a small fleet of instruments that require regular top-ups of liquid helium, the lab had no choice but to sacrifice the greediest of these in order to continue running the most important. Washton's own instrument of choice was a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer \u2013 a huge, hulking tower, capable of peering into the molecular structure of atoms. Such measurements can contribute to the development of new batteries and energy storage systems, for example.\nThe spectrometer was the only one of its kind in North America, and less than 12 months after its installation it was providing results that were potentially game-changing. When turned on samples of magnesium oxide, for example, it showed the\u00a0minerals are capable of pulling carbon out of the atmosphere.\u00a0Such \"carbon mineralisation\" has long been explored as a way of combatting greenhouse gas emissions, but the results showed how useful these minerals could be.\n\"There had been no definitive evidence of carbonate formations on these particular types of magnesium oxides [before],\" says Washton.\u00a0\"I just could not believe the data. The fact that we had managed to get this data, and the beauty of the story it told, was just amazing,\" Washton says.\nBut then all of that work abruptly had to stop.\nThe rate at which the spectrometer consumed helium made it a problem. In a process Washton later described as \"traumatising\", the instrument was de-energised and mothballed, its experiments suspended. It would sit inert and useless for several months until more helium could be secured. Today, the device is back up and running \u2013 the lab has the helium it needs. For the time being.\nWhat is helium used for?\nHelium is an inert gas, which means that it does not react readily with other substances. It has the lowest boiling point of any element at -269C (-452F) and a low density.\nThe space industry uses helium to keep satellite instruments cool and to clean out rocket engines. It is also used to pressurise the fuel tanks of space rockets.\nHelium also cools equipment within the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as well as the superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners.\nHelium is often used to fill party balloons, weather balloons and airships due to its low density.\nDeep-sea divers rely on helium to control the proportions of oxygen and nitrogen they get from their breathing apparatus, since this helps to avoid decompression sickness.\nThe episode highlights how vulnerable helium supplies are and why there is now a desperate scramble around the world to find ways of conserving and recycling this crucial gas.\nThe shortages in 2022 didn't just affect researchers. You might not realise it, but many of the products and processes you encounter each day depend on helium.\nHospitals, for example, are the world's largest consumers of helium, accounting for around 32% of the global market. The gas is used to cool magnets in vital diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. Helium is also used in the manufacturing of the semiconductors (computer chips), which are at the heart of electronic devices. It's also used in welding and even pressurises the fuel tanks of rockets that put satellites into orbit. Plus, helium is part of the gas mixture that inflates car safety airbags.\nHelium is odourless, extremely light and, unlike another very light element once used in airships, hydrogen, it will never burst into flames. When cooled, it only condenses into a liquid at the stunningly low temperature of roughly 4.2 Kelvin, or -269C/-452F. Plus, under normal atmospheric conditions, helium will not freeze even at temperatures as low as absolute zero, or 0 Kelvin (-273C/-460F). This makes it incredibly useful.\u00a0\n\"Helium is a magical element,\" says Sophia Hayes, professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis. \"There is nothing else like it in the Universe.\"\nLiquid helium takes on strange properties when it is chilled almost to absolute zero, turning into a superfluid that flows without friction. Stir a cup of superfluid helium and the liquid inside would theoretically keep spinning forever. Superfluid helium has become vital for large-scale superconductors, such as those used by the Large Hadron Collider experiment at Cern on the border between Switzerland and France.\nBut since 2006, helium has repeatedly been in short supply. The most recent extended shortage started in January 2022 before easing the following year. But helium supplies have remained precarious, with producers struggling to keep up with demand.\nThat demand is only expected to rise further \u2013 with some analysts predicting that it will double by 2035 due to helium's key roles in semiconductor and electric vehicle battery manufacturing, as well as in aerospace applications.\nThere are only two sources of helium: the highly-energetic nuclear fusion reactions inside stars, including our Sun, and the slow decay radioactive elements in Earth's crust. Since we can't artificially manufacture helium with today's technology, that means it is essentially a finite resource. Instead, helium is typically mined alongside natural gas by drilling deep wells into the ground, but only a handful of companies across the world currently do this.\nHelium is also a remarkably uncooperative element. The extraction and burning of fossil fuels have caused increasing amounts of helium to build up in the Earth's atmosphere in recent decades, depleting the resource otherwise locked inside our planet.\nBut helium is so light that it is also slowly leaking out of the Earth's atmosphere and heading off into space. In its superfluid state, it has a habit of finding its way out of even the tiniest cracks and holes. It can even flow up walls in this superfluid state. That makes it difficult to handle and store \u2013 it can be easily lost after use.\nAll of this makes the helium supply chain fragile \u2013 resulting in four worldwide helium shortages in the last twenty years alone.\nThe most recent severe shortage in 2022 that scuppered some of Washton's research occurred after a series of fires at a major Russian gas processing plant in the Amur region of Siberia. The war in Ukraine compounded the problem by further choking supplies at the same time a helium plant in Qatar went offline for planned maintenance. Meanwhile, the crude helium enrichment unit at the US National Helium Reserve was shut down during the summer of 2021 and again for four months at the end of January 2022. The US shutdown removed around 10% of the global production capacity of helium from the supply chain. Taken together, these incidents led to a sudden shortage and highlighted just how vulnerable the world's helium supply could be. By 2023, the industrial sale price of helium had nearly doubled from what it was five years before, reaching an all-time high.\nAlthough helium production has since increased, the world yet again faces potential disruption, leaving market prices volatile. In September 2024, the EU began enforcing new sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, including banning imports of helium. While Russia accounts for only 1% of the EU's helium imports, the move marked a further tightening of supplies. On top of that, the sale of the world's largest helium reserve \u2013 the US Federal Helium Reserve \u2013 has triggered further uncertainty.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Why the world is running out of sand\n\u2022\u00a0How Google's ballons surprised their creator\n\u2022\u00a0The world's forgotten greenhouse gas\nFor several decades, the US has supplied around one-tenth of the world's helium from an underground federal stockpile established a century ago near Amarillo, Texas. But in June 2024, the Bureau of Land Management, which ran the US helium reserve, sold the last gasp of federal helium to the German gas supplier Messer. Ahead of the handover, the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine released a report warning that the sale of the strategic reserve to a commercial company could heighten uncertainty in the helium market.\u00a0\nTrade bodies including The Compressed Gas Association and the Advanced Medical Technology Association \u2013 AdvaMed \u2013 urged the US government to delay the sale on the grounds that it risked a \"supply chain crisis\". And healthcare contractor Premier Inc, which sources helium on behalf of thousands of hospitals, suggested the sale could have a detrimental impact on patient care.\u00a0\nAlthough these fears are yet to be realised, there are signs that not all is going smoothly.\nWithin months of the sale, Messer was forced to request a temporary restraining order to prevent another shutdown of the crude helium enrichment unit \u2013 this was due to the expiry of a critical lease and a negotiation dispute. The company that ran the enrichment unit was later placed into receivership. Messer, however, says its helium system \"has been operating reliably and without interruption since we acquired it last June, and we anticipate smooth uninterrupted operations in the future\".\nBut a recent analysis of helium supplies suggests that this natural resource is likely to take on growing geopolitical importance over the coming years as demand and competition for the gas increases.\nThe US accounts for about 46% of the global supply of helium, followed by Qatar (38%) and then Algeria (5%). If US supplies were to be disrupted again, the impact would be felt around the world.\nYears of precarious helium supplies and price fluctuations, however, have also forced academic, commercial and clinical bodies to explore more sustainable modes of helium consumption. Firmly in their crosshairs are helium-hungry MRI machines.\nA standard MRI machine requires a little under 2,000 litres of liquid helium to cool its superconducting magnets. Each unit needs occasional top-ups and, without the cooling helium, its magnets would heat up, evaporate the helium reservoir, and expel it in a process called \"quenching\". It's rare, but dire: the helium is lost, and another couple thousand litres of the liquid is required to put the machine back into working order. If a quenching incident causes more serious damage, then the whole MRI machine might need replacing at great expense.\u00a0\nNow, a new breed of MRI machines that require significantly less helium are emerging. Many of these low-helium units need as little as one litre of helium to operate, sealing it in a closed system. In recent years, these machines have already begun appearing in hospitals and research institutions.\u00a0 \u00a0\nBut there are limits. These low-helium scanners are especially expensive, and it would still take many years to replace the more than 35,000 MRI machines that use superconductors worldwide.\nThe new scanners are also only capable of producing magnetic field strengths of around 1.5 Tesla \u2013 roughly half of what their beefier predecessors can put out. \"Higher-field-strength scanners have the potential to scan in finer detail and/or faster than lower-field-strength scanners,\" says Sharon Giles, director of clinical and research imaging operations at King's College London. The use of these low-helium scanners, then, is limited, although Giles says they're still capable of performing routine imaging in a lab setting.\nOther researchers have searched for ways to cut out helium entirely by developing superconducting materials that don't need to be cooled to such extremes.\nMore widely, researchers are starting to shore up their own supplies by recycling. Helium recovery systems can recapture evaporated helium that would otherwise be lost. \"It will allow us to recover about 90% of the helium that we purchase every year,\" says Nicholas Fitzkee, director of Mississippi State University's nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) facility, which is in the process of installing a recovery system. \"We did the calculations when we wrote the proposal and the total cost of the system was just over $300,000 (\u00a3238,000), and it should pay for itself within six years.\"\nBut installing helium recovery technology \u2013 complicated arrangements of pipes, tubing and headers that must be fed through a facility's instruments \u2013 is time-consuming and complex. These systems can fail, leak, and even when done right, Washton worries that some people may not fully appreciate their benefit. \"To make an argument, 'Hey, I need $600,000 (\u00a3476,000) for a couple of helium recovery units', people are like, 'Well, what's that gonna do for us? That's kind of like you're putting in new plumbing',\" she says, explaining that such work doesn't have the \"bling\" factor that helps justify certain other scientific investments.\nBut there may also be some signs of relief on the horizon. Qatar is on course to open a new helium plant by 2027, while other companies have started to look for previously untapped underground fields.\nIn 2016, the world's largest helium reserve was found in Tanzania. It is set to start production in 2025. This was actually the first helium gas field to be discovered deliberately, and the launch of operations there will mark the first time helium has been recovered at scale, rather than as a by-product of polluting natural gas extraction. Major helium reserves have also been discovered in China's Bohai Bay Basin.\nChristopher Ballentine, chair of geochemistry at the University of Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences, contributed to the scientific research that ultimately helped to locate the Tanzanian helium deposit. But he cautions against over-excitement. \"The challenge of finding significant helium deposits to meet the growing global demand requires significant finances and a long lead-in time,\" he says.\nVolatile supplies in recent years have reminded everyone just how exhaustible this precious resource is \u2013 and how quickly its supply can be pinched off.\nWashton emphasises the risks: \"Imagine if there's just not enough helium, and your grandma can't get her MRI because its superconductor is dead. This is serious and we need to deal with it.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "For decades, the gamchha has been a ubiquitous presence on Indian streets.\nThe traditional scarf, made out of a red-and-white chequered piece of fabric, is used as a towel, pillow, turban, eye mask and even a shoulder drape, mostly by the working classes in West Bengal state and other regions of the country.\nBut an exhibition in India's capital Delhi, that concluded two weeks ago, has highlighted the history of the ordinary fabric in a unique way.\nTitled Gamchha: From the Ordinary to the Extraordinary, it displayed more than 250 pieces of the short drape from 14 Indian states to show the variations of the scarf-towel across regions. \nFrom white gamchhas from Kerala with pencil-thin coloured borders, Ikat-woven ones from Odisha to Assam's cotton \"gamusa\" with red swans and large floral patterns, the interpretations varied from mill-made to hand-woven.\n\"The show is about speaking up for a social equality symbol that the garment can evoke, even after decades of being left out from the discourse,\" said textiles expert Jaya Jaitly, the founder of the Dastkari Haat Samiti, a crafts organisation which presented this show.\nThe exhibition is part of a series of shows and endeavours, held in the past few months, that seek to redefine our understanding of Indian textiles by taking it in new directions.\nFrom rich woven silks, patterned brocades and intricate chintz to a range of less talked-about textiles, India's contribution to the global textile industry is unique.\nBut despite the recognition, including at some of the world's largest museums, its documentation has been exclusionary and has not kept up with the contemporary practices within the industry.\nUntil now.\nHeld by art and craft foundations and curated by researchers in collaboration with private collectors and museums, a number of new exhibitions are sparking something of a renaissance within the industry.\nIt's a departure from the more popular, glamourised take on fashion - there are no crowd-pulling Bollywood stars opening the show, or sponsored after-parties. And the venues are often away from big cities.\nInstead, the focus is on moving away from urban designers - most of whom are trained in elite colleges in India and abroad - and bring local artisans directly into the fold.\nThese exhibitions are leading towards \"technology-prompted egalitarianism\" in the textiles ecosystem, says Ritu Sethi, founder of India's Crafts Revival Trust. \"Because of Instagram and other digital platforms, the anonymity around craftspeople is also shedding off,\" she says.\nWhat was once a small community of curators and patrons, has now grown to include experts from various fields, including art and architecture. \nTogether, they want to take the history of textiles beyond its extolled richness - associated with the grandeur of palaces, and fineries of ceremonial rituals and weddings - to include diverse cloth-making traditions and the people behind it.\nThe sculpting of a more inclusive contemporary identity is, according to acclaimed designer David Abraham, a homecoming and \"a reclamation of pride and value\".\n\"For Indians, the relationship with textiles is deep-rooted. We express ourselves culturally through colours, weaves and fabric and each of these has a meaning assigned to it. These shows are reaffirming a value in our system,\" he says.\nConsider these instances. Textiles of Bengal: A Shared Legacy, on display in Kolkata until the end of March, highlights the historic uniqueness of the textile traditions of undivided Bengal.\nOn display are some never-seen-before fabrics and garments from the 17th Century to now. There are cotton sarees and dhotis (drapes worn by men) that showcase the region's famed hand weaving traditions such as Jamdani, which continues to be a sought-after fabric even today. Then, there are rare Indo-Portuguese embroideries and some Haji Rumals - embroidered religious cloth once exported to Indonesia and parts of the Arab world as a headdress for men.\nThe programme includes talks and demonstrations of craft techniques as well as cultural performances - noted dancer Purnima Ghosh performed at one of the sessions dressed in a hand-painted Batik sari. Batik involves drawing designs on fabric with hot liquid wax and a metal object. Artists then use fine brushes to paint dyes within the wax outlines.\n\"The goal is to bring back attention to Bengal's shared legacy with Bangladesh, be it textiles, techniques, skills and trades, as well as narrative histories, culture and food, the shifting geographies notwithstanding, \"says Darshan Mekani Shah, founder of Weavers Studio Resource Centre, which is holding the exhibition.\nElsewhere, curators are trying to introduce a more nuanced understanding of the history of textiles in India, including the ways in which it has been influenced by larger social realities of caste and class struggles.\nTake Pampa: Textiles of Karnataka presented by the Abheraj Baldota Foundation that concluded earlier this month in Hampi, a Unesco World Heritage Site. Among the hundreds of textiles on display there was the embroidery work of the Lambanis, a local nomadic tribe; the Kaudi quilts created by the Siddhi community of the state, which traces its origins to Africa; as well as sacred textiles made for Buddhist monasteries.\nThrough these depictions, the show tries to tell the histories of the nomadic, tribal and agrarian communities for whom resilient survival was the leitmotif and cloth a way of narrating their marginalised experiences.\nAnd it's not just all about history - some exhibitions highlight the future of the industry too, as designers find new and innovative ways of imagining traditional textiles in a contemporary idiom.\nFor instance, the recently concluded Surface: An Exhibition of Indian Embroideries and Surface Embellishment as Art, goes beyond apparel and home decor and spotlights the ways textiles are also being used in paintings, drawings, art installations and sculptures.\nThe show, organised by Sutrakala Foundation and held around a stepwell in the old city of Jodhpur, featured a set of textile art pieces made by renowned contemporary painter Manisha Parekh.\nThese shows also play an important role in updating the history of textiles by rigorously documenting it.\n\"Even some of the country's biggest fashion institutes do not have an archive of our textiles,\" says Lekha Poddar, co-founder of Devi Art Foundation, which has supported nine exhibitions on textiles in the past decade.\nThe Devi Art Foundation's recent project, titled, Pehchaan: Enduring Themes in Indian Textiles, has tried to bridge that gap.\nPresented in collaboration with Delhi's National Museum, the show featured a survey of visual and material ideas that have recurred in Indian textiles for more than 500 years, with the oldest exhibit ranging from the 14th and 15th Centuries.\n\"How will young designers find inspiration for their work if they are not aware of their own histories and don't have visual references for it?\" Ms Poddar asks.\nThe success of these shows has made organisers hopeful about its future.\nThe next few years will be all about furthering this creative ecology, says Mayank Mansingh Kaul, who has served as curatorial adviser to 20 such exhibitions in the last 10 years. \n\"Slowly, we will build new audiences, collaborate more and nudge the next generation of makers and practitioners to aspire for quality.\"\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "Donald Trump has said he \"couldn't care less\" if carmakers raise prices after his 25% tariffs on foreign-made vehicles comes into effect.\nSome analysts have warned that Trump's import charges could lead to the temporary shutdown of some US car production, with increased prices passed onto consumers.\nBut the US president told NBC News on Saturday that he hoped foreign carmakers will raise prices as it meant \"people are gonna buy American-made cars - we have plenty\".\nOn Wednesday, Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts entering the US to begin on 2 April. Charges on businesses importing vehicles are expected on 3 April, and taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.\nWhen asked about what his message was to car bosses, he said: \"The message is congratulations. If you make your car in the United States, you're going to make a lot of money.\"\nHe continued: \"If you don't, you're going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"\nRecent polling by BBC's US partner CBS News suggests that consumers are worried the tariffs will raise prices, with 72% indicating that they believe costs will increase in the short-term. More than half of respondents said the Trump administration is not focusing enough on lowering costs for Americans.\nAsked about this sentiment on Sunday, Trump's senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro asked people to put their trust in the US president.\n\"Trust in Trump,\" Navarro told Fox News, adding that previous tariffs on China by the US have led to \"prosperity and price stability\". \n\"The reason why we will not see inflation is because foreigners are going to eat most of it, they have to,\" he said, adding that the US \"is the biggest market in the world.\" \nShawn Fain, the leader of union United Auto Workers, criticised Trump for his labour and immigration policies on CBS Face the Nation - but he said tariffs were a necessary \"tool in the toolbox\" to return manufacturing to the US.\n\"There is plenty of opportunity. And I've had companies tell us, point blank, that they're going to have to bring product back here if those tariffs are implemented.\"\nThe 25% import tax on carmakers from Canada and Mexico was briefly implemented but then paused at the beginning of March, following pleas from major North American manufacturers like Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.\nBut Trump told NBC that he did not plan to delay the tariffs on cars any longer, saying he would consider negotiating \"only if people are willing to give us something of great value - because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there's no room for negotiation\".\nIn another interview with NBC News on Sunday, he threatened to impose secondary tariffs of 25-50% on Russian oil if he feels Vladimir Putin is stalling progress on Ukraine peace talks.\n\"If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault - which it might not be - but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\" he told the outlet.\n\"There will be a 25% tariff on oil and other products sold in the United States, secondary tariffs,\" Trump said, adding that tariffs on Russia would come within a month without a ceasefire deal.\nTrump said Putin knows he is angry, but that he has \"a very good relationship\" with the Russian president.\nHe went on to say that \"the anger dissipates quickly\" but only if Putin \"he does the right thing\".\nTrump said he will speak to Putin again this week.\nAnalysts say the upcoming tariffs that Trump has planned could further strain relations with some of the US's main trading partners.\nTrump's comments come as Downing Street sources said the UK would not hesitate to retaliate against US tariffs if needed.\nThe UK is in last-minute negotiations with the White House and is trying to get an exemption, arguing that - unlike other countries - the UK has a relatively equal trading relationship with the US. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he does not want to jump into a trade war.\nSeveral major economies have also vowed to retaliate in response to Trump's tariffs.\nGermany has said it \"will not give in\" and that Europe must \"respond firmly\", while France's president branded the move \"a waste of time\" and \"incoherent\". \nCanada has called it a \"direct attack\", and China accused Washington of violating international trade rules.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nPundits on Rashford's MOTM performance against Preston\nMarcus Rashford has got his swagger back.\nThe Aston Villa loanee ended his 120-day goal drought with a second-half double at Preston on Sunday to help Unai Emery's side set up an FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace - and provide another clear sign he is enjoying his football again.\nFrozen out of the first-team picture at Manchester United by head coach Ruben Amorim just weeks after he replaced Erik ten Hag at the helm, even those closest to Rashford accepted he had a major point to prove when he completed his loan move to Aston Villa on 3 February.\nThose working with him can see the improvement in Rashford, maybe not quite to the levels of old but certainly a far cry from the passive figure he appeared at Old Trafford for most of the previous 18 months.\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel must have felt so too, judging by the speed with which he restored Rashford to the international fold earlier this month.\nYet there were plenty of doubters. They were out in force on social media during the first half of Villa's 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory at Preston, as Rashford wasted a couple of free-kicks as the visitors struggled to turn their dominance into goals.\nThe only measure, though, of a striker's success is the regularity they hit the back of the net - and he hadn't done it for 14 games and counting since his double for United against Everton on 1 December.\nBut when Lucas Digne presented the opportunity 13 minutes into the second half at Deepdale, Rashford's innate ability did the rest as he calmly picked his spot before finding the bottom corner. \nFive minutes later, despite a wait for the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm Villa should be awarded a penalty, and goalkeeper David Cornell offering some 'advice' as he walked past to take up his position, Rashford's nerve held. He took his time, did an extended stuttering run-up, and found the net.\n\"The swagger is back,\" gushed Guy Mowbray in his Match of the Day commentary. \"The confidence and the pose.\"\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Rashford told BBC Sport afterwards: \"It's always nice for a forward to get a goal, so hopefully it continues.\n\"I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. I missed a lot of football before joining up with them. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now.\"\nFA Cup 'sparkle' returns - but will there be a 'fairytale ending'?\nRashford scores double as Aston Villa beat Preston in FA Cup quarters\nForest draw Bournemouth or Man City, Palace v Villa\nThis video can not be played\nRashford scores first Villa goals within space of five minutes\nThe deal United struck with Villa to let Rashford leave is not straightforward.\nThe precise nature of the loan deal is complicated. United have said 75% of Rashford's wages are being covered, although they have not explained exactly how. \nThat could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.\nThat, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League - Villa have been paired with French heavyweights Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals - as well as the FA Cup.\nUnai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957. \nIn addition, they are ninth in the Premier League, three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City, who occupy what is virtually certain to be the final Champions League spot.\nThat proliferation of targets underscores why Emery did not really want to talk about the likelihood of Villa triggering their \u00a340m option to turn Rashford's move into a permanent deal.\n\"We can't waste time speaking about that,\" he said\n\"If next year we are in the Champions League, in the Europa, or Conference League or not. Or we don't win a trophy - it is completely different.\"\nMarcus Rashford (left) celebrates his second goal for Aston Villa at Preston\nUnlike Villa, Rashford has won the FA Cup twice in recent memory, including last season. He has also been part of teams who have won the Europa League and EFL Cup. In addition, he has 60 England caps. His past playbook means if he can reach the standards he has previously set, he would be an asset to any side in the world.\nIt is that talent Emery is trying to coax out of the player. It is, in the modern football vocabulary, 'a process'.\nThe Aston Villa boss, said: \"There is still work, still weeks to get it, but today he did one step forward. He is feeling comfortable, getting confident and scoring goals. He was obviously getting better, but today it was more in his adaptation and helping us.\n\"He's playing in the idea, in the plan we did with him. He has played more as a winger on the left side but he's played in some moments as a striker. Today we decided to play him as a striker to his quality, his power and the way he exploits things. \n\"The process we have with him is more or less not changing. There is still work to do because he came here after not training consistently and not feeling in his best fitness. Progressively playing more and with the national team will help him to feel better and today was confirmation of that, which is good.\"\nThe painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nThe good thing from Rashford's perspective is he is beginning to put together a positive body of work to counter the extended period of drift he experienced at United.\nIt still feels bizarre he has left his boyhood club for a perceived smaller rival, yet finds himself entering the final two months of the campaign with substantially more to play for - both in number and prestige of competitions - than he would have had if he remained at Old Trafford.\nNo professional career is a straight line ascent, which is why insight from those who have been there and done it is so valuable.\n\"You are constantly being asked questions at the top,\" said former England keeper Joe Hart on Match of the Day.\n\"Maybe Rashford found himself in a lull but he has come to Villa with people around him that know what they are doing. He hasn't come here with question marks about how he is going to behave and what he is going to do and how he can change the team.\"\nHart found himself frozen out for a time at Manchester City and Micah Richards did not have the greatest time at Aston Villa.\nBut, like Hart, Rashford can see how a change of scenery has provided the impetus for improvement.\n\"He looks confident and happy,\" said Richards.\n\"It was a big move going to Villa. But when you've got a manager that believes in you, you can do special things.\n\"His whole body language looks a lot better and his all-round game was brilliant. That is the best way to shut people up. People were asking questions about not fulfilling his potential but that is the way to answer.\n\"I really like Rashford in these wide areas because he's always looking to run in behind.\nWhen I talk about body language and his movement - his all round game today was brilliant.\"\nGet Aston Villa news sent straight to your phone",

But others, such as Sonic, were massive hits, so that's what Warner Bros will no doubt be hoping for.\nBy Mark Savage, music correspondent\nAmerican actor Joe Keery is best known as reformed jock Steve Harrington, one of the main (and most loveable) characters in the sci-fi series Stranger Things.\nBut he's also got a nifty line in throwback indie-pop, which he performs as Djo. The pseudonym was initially an attempt to avoid the accusations he was trading on his fame. He'd even perform in disguise.\nThat changed when he had a breakout hit with End of Beginning \u2013 a synth-heavy slice of psychedelia that went viral on TikTok last year, often the soundtrack to videos about what people would do if they won the lottery.\nThe attention put a rocket under his music career. While his first two albums were DIY affairs, recorded in a couple of days and self-released, his latest, The Crux, was created in New York's fabled Electric Lady studios.\nReleased on Friday, it's packed full of off-kilter lyrics and squiggly synth lines that burrow into your brain. The first two singles, Delete Ya and Basic Being Basic have already been radio hits, and the rest of the album pulls on influences as diverse as Electric Light Orchestra, New Order, Cake, Hall & Oates and Bruce Springsteen (coincidentally, all bands that would work perfectly on the Stranger Things soundtrack).\nThere are a couple of knockouts \u2013 including the crunchy garage rock of Gap Toothed Smile, and the choppy New Wave anthem Link \u2013 but the point of the album is its diversity. Keery envisioned each song as the story of a separate guest at a hotel where everyone is at a spiritual or emotional crossroads.\nSIX the Musical tells the story of the many wives of Henry VIII, as they step out of the shadow of their infamous husband and reclaim the narrative.\nNow, the queens are moving to the screen.\nA filmed stage production of SIX The Musical Live!, featuring the original West End cast, will be released in cinemas on Sunday.\nCreators Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss told me what to expect.\n\u201cIt's not simply a live capture of what's on stage, but an immersive, pop-concert experience,\u201d they said.\n\u201cYou get to witness the incredible performances up close \u2013 noticing little details and subtleties you might miss in the theatre. But you also get exciting, inventive, explosive visuals that make you feel like part of the party.\u201d\nBy Tom Gerken, tech reporter\nThis week has been in the diaries of gaming fans around the world for months, as we finally are about to learn what's coming with the Switch 2, the much-anticipated sequel to the Nintendo Switch, aka the third-best selling console in history.\nSo it's no surprise that we're going to get some news on Wednesday \u2013 but the question is, what?\nAlmost certainly Nintendo will unveil a price and a launch date. But quite what that will be, who knows \u2013 July 2025 feels like a safe bet, but to be fair, would anyone be surprised if it came out in December?\nFans are desperate for news on games. The rumour mill swirls with talks of a new Mario, Zelda and Pok\u00e9mon, but nobody has any proof to back it up. (I'd personally bite your hand off for a new Fire Emblem, but that's just me\u2026)\nWill we see super flashy new graphics? A high quality screen? A better battery life? There are too many questions to list.\nOnly one thing is really certain \u2013 whatever happens, when Nintendo's announcement is over, we'll be left counting down the days to the console's actual release\u2026 whenever that may be.",

        "article_text": "Some 68 years ago today, millions of people tuned into a BBC Panorama report about a Swiss family harvesting spaghetti from trees.\nIt may sound implausible, but many viewers believed it.\nWatch the grainy black-and-white footage today and you almost forget everything you know about Italian cuisine for a moment.\nThe actors \"harvesting\" spaghetti strands give committed performances, and the late Richard Dimbleby's deadpan narration lends an air of authenticity to the report.\nIt was, of course, an April Fool's Day joke.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, spaghetti is made from wheat and water. It does not grow on trees.\nBut spaghetti was not a common dish in the UK at the time, so you can see why some may have taken it seriously.\nThis vintage Panorama report is part of what became a tradition in the UK press. \nEvery year on 1 April, newspapers would publish outlandish stories with zero or very little basis in fact, all to have a bit of fun with their readers.\nThe Guardian ran an entire pull-out guide to the fictional Indian Ocean island of \"San Serriffe\" in the 1970s. Its name is a pun on the sans serif group of typefaces, and the island was depicted as being shaped like a semi-colon.\nTen years ago, April Fool's stories in the newspapers were so prevalent that the BBC published this roundup of them.\nMany focused on the looming 2015 general election, with the Sun's election website saying then-Labour leader Ed Miliband had dyed his hair blond in a \"desperate bid for the BoJo [Boris Johnson] factor\".\nIt is unclear whether the move would have swayed the election had this story been true.\nThe Scottish independence referendum was the focus on 1 April 2014, with the Daily Express, the Daily Mail, the Sun and the Guardian all publishing prank stories that year.\nThe Guardian, for example, said an independent Scotland would switch to driving on the right.\nReading through the papers today, you might find one or two April Fool's Day stories. But they do not have the same presence they once had.\nThe rise of social media has ushered in a \"different kind of relationship\" between readers and the press, says Stuart Allan, professor of journalism and communication at Cardiff University.\n\"We are enmeshed in an era of 'fake news' and disinformation, where matters of trust are at the forefront of editors' minds,\" he tells the BBC.\nThe decline of April Fool's Day news stories comes against \"a backdrop of growing scepticism about news in general,\" Prof Allan adds, \"where playing with journalistic credibility may actually prove damaging\".\nJim Waterson, who edits news outlet London Centric, agrees.\n\"Publishing fake news to purposefully trick readers and then saying it's all a joke doesn't really work well when you spend the rest of the year banging on about how much trusted facts matter,\" he says.\n\"But the biggest crime against journalism is that very few newspaper April Fool's stories are remotely funny.\"\nThe global political climate, with Donald Trump's re-election to the US presidency, has also had an impact.\n\"If you've got world leaders who are only too happy to dismiss anything factual they don't like as 'fake news', why would you give them the ammunition of literal fake news?\" Mr Waterson asks.\nSocial media also makes it easy to take a news story out of context.\nPeople used to read their news in a newspaper. They'd be aware, on 1 April, that all of the news stories were published that day. The tell-tale date was at the top of the page.\nNow, readers can share online news stories on social media days, months or even years after they were first published.\nMany people share news articles without reading a single word of them, according to a Columbia University study. So are they likely to read the publication date?\nThen there is the rise of generative AI, which has been widely used in the spread of misinformation in recent years.\nIn a world where AI-generated images can appear almost real, the media's role of separating fact from fiction has never been more important.\nApril Fool's stories serve the entertainment function of journalism, but not truth or accuracy, says Dr Bina Ogbebor, a lecturer in journalism studies at Sheffield University.\nIn some cases, these stories could \"backfire\", make some readers angry, and hamper a media organisation's credibility, she tells the BBC. \n\"It's still something that makes people laugh,\" she says, adding she thinks news websites should add very clear disclaimers if they do choose to run them.\nThough news publishers have taken a step back, the April Fool's tradition is alive and well on social media. But it is brands, not broadcasters, that are leading the charge.\nEach year, many of them post announcements for new products or promotions that are slightly too ridiculous to be genuine. \nTesco once announced it would be trialling trampoline-inspired bouncy aisles in its supermarkets.\nBut brands could find themselves in hot water for playing tricks on newspapers without letting them in on the joke.\nIn late March 2021, Volkswagen claimed it was changing its name to \"Voltswagen\" in a nod to electric vehicles. \nDozens of publications had to publish corrections when it was revealed to have been an April Fool's prank sent to the media early.\nBased on current trends, it is unlikely we will see an April Fool's hoax on the scale of Panorama's spaghetti report any time soon.\n\"The Spaghetti Harvest story of 1957 landed with such a splash because of the very limited news brand choice in those days,\" says Richard Thomas, media professor at Swansea University.\nThanks to the wider range of news sources available instantly on the internet, \"the joke is dead before it even takes its first breath\", he adds.\n\"So the days when the country's most trusted broadcaster and news source can playfully tease its audience on such a scale that we are remembering it almost 70 years later are over. \n\"And - all sentiments about how news should be honest and truthful aside - in a world where happy news is often at a premium, that does seem a shame, somehow.\"\nAdditional reporting by Grace Dean.",

for their trip to Toulon.\nDirector of rugby Mark McCall says he is prioritising making the Premiership play-offs over the chance at a fourth European crown.\nNorthampton Saints, meanwhile, are the only English side with a home tie after finishing top of Pool 3.\nSaints are eighth in the Premiership table after enduring a dismal defence of their title, but Phil Dowson's side will host Clermont in a welcome reprieve from their domestic campaign. \nThe visitors are sixth in France's Top 14 table after their recent victory over La Rochelle ended a run of five consecutive league defeats.\nClermont booked their place in the knockout stages by snatching a dramatic 33-26 victory in the sixth minute of overtime to qualify at Bath and Bristol's expense.\nElsewhere, Sale Sharks face a daunting trip to six-time winners and defending champions Toulouse, who will be without injured talisman Antoine Dupont after he ruptured cruciate ligaments in his knee during France's Six Nations win over Ireland last month.\nHarlequins face an equally difficult task at four-time winners Leinster, while Leicester Tigers travel north to take on Glasgow Warriors.\nAll three Irish provinces which started in this season's competition have reached the knockout stages.\nLeinster lead the United Rugby Championship (URC) and will be targeting a fifth star on the jersey after finishing top of Pool 2 with a clean sweep of four comfortable wins.\nFly-half Sam Prendergast has stepped into retired colossus Johnny Sexton's shoes for club and country seamlessly, while the bulk of Ireland's first-choice pack, including Josh van der Flier and Caelan Doris, ply their trade in Dublin.\nMunster finished third in Pool 3 to qualify for the last 16 and they will reunited with their former fly-half Ronan O'Gara in the next round.\nThey will travel to the Stade Marcel-Deflandre to face the 2022 and 2023 champions La Rochelle, who are coached by O'Gara.\nIreland legends Peter O'Mahony and Conor Murray have retired from the international stage and will want to end their long-standing Munster careers this summer with silverware.\nUlster, meanwhile, won just one of their four Pool 1 games and scraped through to the knockout stages on points difference.\nThey will face an away trip to title contenders Bordeaux-Begles, who finished top of Pool 1 after four bonus-point wins, including a 40-19 victory when the two sides last met in December. \nDefending URC champions Glasgow are flying the Scottish flag in the last 16 after finishing second in Pool 4.\nWarriors, who are also currently second in the URC, will welcome Tigers to Scotstoun in fine form after pummelling Johannesburg Lions 42-0 in their most recent outing.\nGeorge Horne became the club's record try-scorer in their victory over the South African side, while Leicester were narrowly beaten by Saracens in their last Premiership match.\nTigers are third in the English top-flight and outgoing head coach Michael Chieka says he will work harder to achieve success domestically and in Europe before leaving the club this summer. \nBenetton, meanwhile, will make their last-16 debut after a surprise 32-25 victory over two-time champions La Rochelle in their final Pool 2 game.\nThe Italian side boast a large contingent of the  Italy national team, including their fearsome centre partnership of Juan Ignacio Brex and Tommaso Menoncello.\nLike Italy, Benetton play a free-flowing brand of rugby and will pose a threat in their trip to French side Castres.\nSix of this season's last 16 hail from France. \nBordeaux-Begles made light work of the pool stages and in France wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey, who last month broke the record for the most tries scored in a Six Nations campaign, boast one of the deadliest finishers in world rugby.\nDespite the loss of Dupont, Top 14 leaders Toulouse are also among the favourites to secure a record seventh European crown.\nThree-time winners Toulon finished top of Pool 4 despite a heavy defeat by Sale Sharks and will be favourites to overcome an under-strength Saracens side.\nLa Rochelle, meanwhile, are without a win in eight matches since they beat Toulouse in January.\nO'Gara has previously led his side to back-to-back Champions Cup titles but he will have to stop this year's rot if he wishes to overcome his former side Munster.\nPool 3 runners-up Castres and Clermont Auvergne make up the French sextet.\nIt could be another final between the tournament's two most successful sides on 24 May at Principality Stadium as Toulouse and Leinster both ended up on opposite sides of the draw.\nNorthampton will play a home quarter-final if they can navigate their way past Clermont, while a potential semi-final rematch from last year's competition could await against Leinster.\nHowever, a victory for Quins over Leinster and a Leicester win in Glasgow would also set-up an all-Premiership tie in the next round.\nQuarter-final draw

But others, such as Sonic, were massive hits, so that's what Warner Bros will no doubt be hoping for.\nBy Mark Savage, music correspondent\nAmerican actor Joe Keery is best known as reformed jock Steve Harrington, one of the main (and most loveable) characters in the sci-fi series Stranger Things.\nBut he's also got a nifty line in throwback indie-pop, which he performs as Djo. The pseudonym was initially an attempt to avoid the accusations he was trading on his fame. He'd even perform in disguise.\nThat changed when he had a breakout hit with End of Beginning \u2013 a synth-heavy slice of psychedelia that went viral on TikTok last year, often the soundtrack to videos about what people would do if they won the lottery.\nThe attention put a rocket under his music career. While his first two albums were DIY affairs, recorded in a couple of days and self-released, his latest, The Crux, was created in New York's fabled Electric Lady studios.\nReleased on Friday, it's packed full of off-kilter lyrics and squiggly synth lines that burrow into your brain. The first two singles, Delete Ya and Basic Being Basic have already been radio hits, and the rest of the album pulls on influences as diverse as Electric Light Orchestra, New Order, Cake, Hall & Oates and Bruce Springsteen (coincidentally, all bands that would work perfectly on the Stranger Things soundtrack).\nThere are a couple of knockouts \u2013 including the crunchy garage rock of Gap Toothed Smile, and the choppy New Wave anthem Link \u2013 but the point of the album is its diversity. Keery envisioned each song as the story of a separate guest at a hotel where everyone is at a spiritual or emotional crossroads.\nSIX the Musical tells the story of the many wives of Henry VIII, as they step out of the shadow of their infamous husband and reclaim the narrative.\nNow, the queens are moving to the screen.\nA filmed stage production of SIX The Musical Live!, featuring the original West End cast, will be released in cinemas on Sunday.\nCreators Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss told me what to expect.\n\u201cIt's not simply a live capture of what's on stage, but an immersive, pop-concert experience,\u201d they said.\n\u201cYou get to witness the incredible performances up close \u2013 noticing little details and subtleties you might miss in the theatre. But you also get exciting, inventive, explosive visuals that make you feel like part of the party.\u201d\nBy Tom Gerken, tech reporter\nThis week has been in the diaries of gaming fans around the world for months, as we finally are about to learn what's coming with the Switch 2, the much-anticipated sequel to the Nintendo Switch, aka the third-best selling console in history.\nSo it's no surprise that we're going to get some news on Wednesday \u2013 but the question is, what?\nAlmost certainly Nintendo will unveil a price and a launch date. But quite what that will be, who knows \u2013 July 2025 feels like a safe bet, but to be fair, would anyone be surprised if it came out in December?\nFans are desperate for news on games. The rumour mill swirls with talks of a new Mario, Zelda and Pok\u00e9mon, but nobody has any proof to back it up. (I'd personally bite your hand off for a new Fire Emblem, but that's just me\u2026)\nWill we see super flashy new graphics? A high quality screen? A better battery life? There are too many questions to list.\nOnly one thing is really certain \u2013 whatever happens, when Nintendo's announcement is over, we'll be left counting down the days to the console's actual release\u2026 whenever that may be.",

They were out in force on social media during the first half of Villa's 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory at Preston, as Rashford wasted a couple of free-kicks as the visitors struggled to turn their dominance into goals.\nThe only measure, though, of a striker's success is the regularity they hit the back of the net - and he hadn't done it for 14 games and counting since his double for United against Everton on 1 December.\nBut when Lucas Digne presented the opportunity 13 minutes into the second half at Deepdale, Rashford's innate ability did the rest as he calmly picked his spot before finding the bottom corner. \nFive minutes later, despite a wait for the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm Villa should be awarded a penalty, and goalkeeper David Cornell offering some 'advice' as he walked past to take up his position, Rashford's nerve held. He took his time, did an extended stuttering run-up, and found the net.\n\"The swagger is back,\" gushed Guy Mowbray in his Match of the Day commentary. \"The confidence and the pose.\"\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Rashford told BBC Sport afterwards: \"It's always nice for a forward to get a goal, so hopefully it continues.\n\"I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. I missed a lot of football before joining up with them. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now.\"\nFA Cup 'sparkle' returns - but will there be a 'fairytale ending'?\nRashford scores double as Aston Villa beat Preston in FA Cup quarters\nForest draw Bournemouth or Man City, Palace v Villa\nThis video can not be played\nRashford scores first Villa goals within space of five minutes\nThe deal United struck with Villa to let Rashford leave is not straightforward.\nThe precise nature of the loan deal is complicated. United have said 75% of Rashford's wages are being covered, although they have not explained exactly how. \nThat could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.\nThat, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League - Villa have been paired with French heavyweights Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals - as well as the FA Cup.\nUnai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957. \nIn addition, they are ninth in the Premier League, three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City, who occupy what is virtually certain to be the final Champions League spot.\nThat proliferation of targets underscores why Emery did not really want to talk about the likelihood of Villa triggering their \u00a340m option to turn Rashford's move into a permanent deal.\n\"We can't waste time speaking about that,\" he said\n\"If next year we are in the Champions League, in the Europa, or Conference League or not. Or we don't win a trophy - it is completely different.\"\nMarcus Rashford (left) celebrates his second goal for Aston Villa at Preston\nUnlike Villa, Rashford has won the FA Cup twice in recent memory, including last season. He has also been part of teams who have won the Europa League and EFL Cup. In addition, he has 60 England caps. His past playbook means if he can reach the standards he has previously set, he would be an asset to any side in the world.\nIt is that talent Emery is trying to coax out of the player. It is, in the modern football vocabulary, 'a process'.\nThe Aston Villa boss, said: \"There is still work, still weeks to get it, but today he did one step forward. He is feeling comfortable, getting confident and scoring goals. He was obviously getting better, but today it was more in his adaptation and helping us.\n\"He's playing in the idea, in the plan we did with him. He has played more as a winger on the left side but he's played in some moments as a striker. Today we decided to play him as a striker to his quality, his power and the way he exploits things. \n\"The process we have with him is more or less not changing. There is still work to do because he came here after not training consistently and not feeling in his best fitness. Progressively playing more and with the national team will help him to feel better and today was confirmation of that, which is good.\"\nThe painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nThe good thing from Rashford's perspective is he is beginning to put together a positive body of work to counter the extended period of drift he experienced at United.\nIt still feels bizarre he has left his boyhood club for a perceived smaller rival, yet finds himself entering the final two months of the campaign with substantially more to play for - both in number and prestige of competitions - than he would have had if he remained at Old Trafford.\nNo professional career is a straight line ascent, which is why insight from those who have been there and done it is so valuable.\n\"You are constantly being asked questions at the top,\" said former England keeper Joe Hart on Match of the Day.\n\"Maybe Rashford found himself in a lull but he has come to Villa with people around him that know what they are doing. He hasn't come here with question marks about how he is going to behave and what he is going to do and how he can change the team.\"\nHart found himself frozen out for a time at Manchester City and Micah Richards did not have the greatest time at Aston Villa.\nBut, like Hart, Rashford can see how a change of scenery has provided the impetus for improvement.\n\"He looks confident and happy,\" said Richards.\n\"It was a big move going to Villa. But when you've got a manager that believes in you, you can do special things.\n\"His whole body language looks a lot better and his all-round game was brilliant. That is the best way to shut people up. People were asking questions about not fulfilling his potential but that is the way to answer.\n\"I really like Rashford in these wide areas because he's always looking to run in behind.\nWhen I talk about body language and his movement - his all round game today was brilliant.\"\nGet Aston Villa news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "It's only been five months since voters in Wisconsin faced a bitterly fought election, but residents of the US state are already heading back to the polls.\nThis time, Elon Musk looms large in the race to fill a vacancy on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, even if the billionaire's name doesn't appear on the ballot.\nIt's the most expensive judicial contest in US history, with more than $90m (\u00a370m) spent so far, including $20m from Musk and groups affiliated with him.\nThe choice is between conservative Brad Schimel, backed by President Donald Trump and Musk, and liberal Susan Crawford, who is supported by former President Barack Obama and Democratic mega-donors like George Soros. \nIt's forecast to be a tight contest that could flip control of the Midwestern state's top court, which is currently controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.\nBut it's also one of the first real tests of voter sentiment towards Trump, in a state that he won by less than a percentage point during his decisive White House election victory last November.\nThe Republican president's second administration has slashed federal programmes - cuts that have been shepherded by Musk, the world's richest man and a close Trump ally.\n\"This really matters,\" said canvasser Ronneisha Mallet. \"People aren't looking at the bigger picture. People just think this is just a local election. But it goes all the way to the White House.\"\nThe 23-year-old was out knocking doors in a quiet residential area on the outskirts of Milwaukee on Monday, a day before voters were set to cast their ballots. \nShe was here with Bloc - Black Leaders Organising for Communities -\u00a0 encouraging people to vote.\nThese kinds of special elections typically see low voter turnout. But Musk's involvement has supercharged emotions on all sides. \nGroups like Bloc put in extra time to engage with voters.\nNot everyone opened their front door on Monday, but some of those who did told Ms Mallet they had already voted. By Monday, some 644,000 people had cast ballots early, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\n\"I hate Musk! I hate his guts!\" Peggy, standing at her door, said. She didn't want to give the BBC her full name, but described herself as an independent voter who has soured on the Republican Party.\n\"I think Musk bought the presidency,\" she said, in reference to the quarter-of-a-billion dollars that Musk spent in support of Trump's presidential campaign. \n\"And so I think he's trying to buy the election here,\" Peggy continued. \"And I am hoping that people are starting to wake up.\"\nDemocrats, too, have rallied deep-pocketed donors in support of Crawford. Along with Soros, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman have reportedly contributed large sums. But their names haven't inspired the same vitriol as Musk's.\nAnother resident - who gave his name as Palman - said he had already voted, in part as a reaction to Musk.\n\"When you're a billionaire, you don't spend money for no reason,\" he said. \"He's just spending it with purpose.\"\nOn Sunday, Musk hosted a rally where he handed out two $1m cheques to voters who had signed a petition to stop \"activist\" judges who might disrupt Trump's plans. \nWe drove about a half-hour outside of Milwaukee to Waukesha - a swing county that President Trump won. Around 100 people were gathered at the Dockhaus brewery and restaurant overlooking a baseball park, where Schimel made a campaign stop.\nConor Gunar was wearing a red shirt with Musk's name on it.\n\"I'm a big fan,\" he said, clutching his beer. \"He is doing a fantastic job with Doge.\"\n\"Why not?\" he added when asked about Musk's involvement in the race. \"Democrats have people like George Soros and JB Pritzker; why can't we have billionaires?\"\nAnother Schimel supporter, Scarlett Johnson, agreed.\nShe was at Musk's town hall-style event over the weekend, which she described as \"great fun\".\nBut she said she also understood the criticism.\n\"Look, I think it would be great if no billionaires were involved at all, but if they're going to be as they have for Democrats, it's only fair they're involved for Republicans.\"\nOn the left, strategists see a glimmer of light as they search for a clear political strategy. \nDrive down the roads, and you can see billboards plastered in cities like Green Bay and Madison that read \"don't let Elon buy our court\" and depict the SpaceX and Tesla boss as a puppeteer. \nSwitch on the TV and you'll see attack ads that say: \"Elon Musk is out of control.\"\nGoing after Musk instead of Trump seems to be a strategic option for Democrats. \nA poll by Marquette Law School suggests Musk is viewed unfavorably by 53% of registered voters here. \nDriving in his car across rural Wisconsin, Ben Wickler, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, told the BBC that if Crawford could beat Schimel, \"there'll be a very clear kind of game plan for how to fight back against the world's richest man trying to destroy American democracy\".\nAllison Prasch, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who specialises in US political rhetoric, said this race was a strategy test for both sides.\n\"We know that Wisconsin, up to the very end of the presidential cycle, was very close,\" she said, noting that some cities such as Milwaukee and Madison unexpectedly swung towards Trump and helped deliver him the state's electoral college votes.\n\"What happens in Wisconsin [now] is going to tell us a lot about what's going to happen, not just in 2026 but in 2028.\"\nMusk's critics say he has practical reasons to care about the Wisconsin race.\nThey point to an ongoing case involving Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company, that could head to the state's supreme court in the future. \nThe billionaire is suing because Wisconsin bans car manufacturers from owning dealerships, but Tesla's business model involves running its own showrooms.\nThe BBC has contacted Musk's America PAC for comment.\nWisconsin Republican strategist Matt Terrill said Musk was allowed to donate to campaigns for things he personally cared about, like any other citizen might - including the Democratic donors heavily backing Crawford.\n\"Musk has obviously got his views from a political standpoint of what he as an American citizen wants to see happen, not just as someone who's a part of the Trump administration,\" said Terrill. \nThe result won't just be a referendum on Trump's presidency so far, but will test Musk's reputation as a kingmaker in American politics.",

        "article_text": "Heathrow Airport was warned about the \"resilience\" of its power supply in the days before a fire which shut down the airport for more than a day last month.\nNigel Wicking, chief executive of Heathrow Airline Operators' Committee, a group representing airlines, told MPs on Wednesday that he spoke to Heathrow twice in the week before the closure on 21 March.\nHe questioned why the airport was closed as long as it was and why it was not more prepared considering its importance.\nHowever, Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye called the fire an \"unlikely event\" and defended the length of the closure, saying he had to make \"very serious safety decisions\".\nMr Woldbye apologised to the more than 300,000 passengers whose journeys were disrupted.\nHe offered his \"deepest regrets\" adding that the \"situation was unprecedented\". The airport was shutdown after a fire at an electrical substation.\nThe chaos at Heathrow has raised concerns about the reliability of the major transport hub - and brought into question the UK's energy resilience more broadly.\nSpeaking to MPs on the transport committee, Mr Wicking said he raised cases of \"theft of wire and cable around some of the power supply\" which he said temporarily took out runway lights, which are critical to passenger safety.\n\"I wanted to understand better the overall resilience of the airport.\"\nHe said he had spoken to the Team Heathrow director on 15 March about his concerns - six days before the fire - and the chief operating officer and chief customer officer on 19 March - two days before the fire.\nMr Woldbye said the airport had to rely on contracts it has with Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks for making the network resilient, and to improve that \"comes at a very high cost\", which would raise costs for airlines, and passengers.\nHowever, Mr Wicking said Heathrow is \"already the most expensive airport in the world\". \n\"From an airline perspective, we expect resilience, we expect there to be the capability there and the understanding of when a power supply or an asset is not available, what will you do next, and how quickly will you bring it back?\"\nOn the day of the shutdown, airlines had to divert 120 aircraft, which is \"not a light decision to be made in any context\", Mr Wicking added.\nAs a consequence, when Mr Wicking joined a call with NATs, the national air traffic service, at 05:30, \"they'd run out of space within the UK for aircraft to divert\".\n\"Aircraft were then going to Europe, and then some were even halfway across Europe and going back to base in India,\" he said. \"So, quite a level of disruption for those passengers, let alone all of the cancellations\".\nThere were 1,300 cancelled flights, he said.\nThe airport reopened on the Saturday following the fire.\nWhen asked why it had not reopened sooner, Mr Woldbye said that could have meant passengers got hurt.\nHe said: \"If we had got this wrong, we might be sitting here today having a very different discussion about why people got injured, and I think it would have been a much more serious discussion.\n\"So there is a margin within which our people have to take very serious safety decisions, and that is what they are trained for, that is what they do, and that requires that every single system is up and running, tested and safe.\"\nHowever, Mr Wicking said Terminal 5 could have reopened sooner.\nHe said: \"In terms of T5, my understanding both from British Airways but also on the day, was that pretty much everything was fine to operate by mid-morning, by 10 o'clock.\"\nAfter the substation fire began on the Thursday night, Mr Woldbye said Heathrow realised \"during the early hours\" of Friday 21 March that \"we were losing power to the airport\".\n\"In our operations centre you would seen all the red lights go, that the systems were powering down,\" he said. \"We had no information as to why.\"\n\"We then had a slightly later stage call from the fire department that the substation was on fire,\" he said.\nHeathrow is supplied by three substations, but knocking out one caused the airport to shut down.\nMr Woldbye said a third of the airport was powering down and that Terminal 2 was particularly affected, along with certain central systems. He added that it became \"first and foremost a safety situation\".\n\"We need to make sure, when a crisis happens, that people are safe,\" he said.\nThe safest way to proceed was to shut down airport systems, then bring them back on line, he said.\nThe first priority was to check that no-one been caught in lifts or was hurt.\nSafety critical systems such as runway lighting and the control tower \"switched in as they should\", however, he said.\nThe government has backed plans for Heathrow to build a third runway as part of efforts to boost UK economic growth.\nThe airport would need double the amount of power for its expansion plans, Mr Woldbye said.\nHowever, Mr Wicking said airlines, which support expansion, nevertheless had concerns that it would cost \u00a340bn to \u00a360bn, and that the costs would ultimately be passed onto passengers in the form of higher fees.\nThe danger was the expansion could turn into a \"white elephant\", he said.",

        "article_text": "Minecraft is the world's best-selling computer game and soon to be a Hollywood film. This is why children can't get enough of it.\nAJ Minotti has three children \u2013 and they all love playing Minecraft. His twin girls aged 10 and his six-year-old son are constantly building stuff with the endless supply of virtual blocks that fill the game. And Minotti, who works in marketing in Ohio, sometimes gets blown away with what they come up with.\n\"Dad, I want to show you something,\" one of his daughters said to him recently as she held out the screen of her Nintendo Switch. Her avatar stood before a waterfall. After pressing an in-game button, the waterfall stopped, revealing the entrance to a cave. Inside was a subterranean super-lair complete with interactive lighting and display areas for items that she had collected in the game.\n\"It was like this whole underground mansion, basically,\" says Minotti, marvelling. \"I was super impressed by it.\" His daughter had followed some YouTube tutorials but also came up with much of the design herself. \"It takes me back to the feelings I had when I was a kid just hacking away on a computer,\" says Minotti.\nMinecraft is one of the most popular video games of all time. First released in 2009, it had sold more than 300 million copies by 2023. It, and similar games including Roblox and Terraria, are enjoyed by gamers of all ages, from young children to adults.\nThe game seems able absorb the attention of children for up to hours at a time \u2013 no mean feat in our distraction-filled age. Some parents fear their children's interest in Minecraft can border on obsession, or even addiction, as they struggle to tear them away from the computer screen.\nMinecraft's popularity is such that it has now spawned a highly anticipated Hollywood film called A Minecraft Movie, starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa, which is due to be released in April 2025.\nThere could be deep psychological \u2013 even evolutionary \u2013 factors behind the success of Minecraft and games like it, say experts. Such games tap into an innate instinct within all of us \u2013 one that underpins the success of our entire species. The desire to build.\nIf you think about it, children have always enjoyed making things \u2013 sandcastles, forts, treehouses \u2013 to name a few. Consider also wooden blocks, playdough and Lego pieces. Minecraft is, arguably, just a recent iteration of this kind of play, but in a digital space. But why is building things so irresistible for many children in the first place?\nAll mammals play when they're young, says Peter Gray, a psychologist who studies children's ways of learning at Boston College, in Massachusetts, US. Predatory animals, for example, play at catching things. Prey animals practise dodging and darting.\n\"They play at the skills that are most important for them to develop for their survival and ultimate ability to mate,\" says Gray. Humans are unlike other animals in that we owe much of our survival to our ability to build stuff \u2013 from mud huts to tools for hunting and gathering. \"It's not surprising that natural selection endowed young people with a strong drive to play at building things,\" says Gray.\nHe notes that children also play using language and imagination, or make games that have rules and social interaction at their heart \u2013 all seemingly as part of preparation for adulthood.\nWhat youngsters choose to build during playtime, and how they build it, tends to reflect the culture they live in, says Gray. \"We should not be at all surprised that kids are really drawn to playing on computers today \u2013 nor should that distress us,\" he says. \"Kids know in their bones, in their instincts I would say, that these are the skills [they] need to develop.\"\nJulian Togelius, a computer scientist at New York University, has noticed the impulse to build things emerging in his son \u2013 who is not even three years old. At nursery, he immediately starts making tunnels so that he can drive toy trains and trucks through them, explains Togelius. When his son gets a bit older, computers might become irresistible. Crucially, sandbox games \u00ad\u2013 video games such as Minecraft that offer players the freedom to explore their creativity without any particular goal \u2013 make it easy to interact with and do things on computers, says Togelius.\n\"In Minecraft world, creating [something] is direct and simple,\" he explains. \"It's way easier than writing code.\" In other words, games like this satisfy the innate urge to build when computers, traditionally, might otherwise hinder that impulse, especially for children.\nAnd yet constructive play isn't the only draw. While sandbox mode in the game lets players create with freedom, there's also Survival Mode, in which the gamer is tasked with fighting off enemies. Minotti also notes that there is a social side to the game too. When his kids can't meet up with their friends or cousins in-person, they can do so online: \"It becomes that virtual hangout space.\"\nMinecraft is perhaps better thought of as an arena or virtual playground within which children can find their own niche \u2013 since they can choose from a wide range of activities and play styles.\nTogelius has studied how gamers' behaviour in Minecraft reveals aspects of their personalities. He argues that, because of the freedom afforded to players, it is easier to express themselves in the game than in, say, the arcade classic Asteroids, where players shoot at incoming space rocks. As part of his study, Togelius and colleagues asked adult participants to answer a questionnaire that revealed details of their personalities. They then compared those results to how each participant played Minecraft. The participants' in-game behaviour correlated with certain traits.\n\"Independence is strongly predicted by not finishing the main quest in the game,\" says Togelius. Plus, people who expressed having deeply-held family values in their questionnaire responses seemed to unwittingly demonstrate that through their in-game activities. \"They build little homes and fortresses with fences and stuff.\" While Togelius hasn't repeated the study with children, he says he wouldn't be surprised if their personalities also manifested themselves in-game, too.\nHe also found that Minecraft players in their survey tended to differ from the population at large, being substantially more curious and less driven by traits such as vengeance.\nThe breadth of possibilities in sandbox games helps to ensure wide appeal, says Bailey Brashears, a psychologist at Texas Tech University, who last year published a thesis on how Minecraft can be used as a psychological research tool. Brashears identified five distinct gameplay aspects. There's a social element, the opportunity to feel competent through combat or exploration-based play, engineering, creativity and finally survival-based gameplay.\n\"Most games, you're only going to get one or two of these elements,\" Brashears says. \"You'll get a game that's mostly social play and survival \u2013 like Fortnite,\" she says.\nOf course, the amount of time children spend playing Minecraft speaks to wider concerns around how much screen time they are getting in general. (Read this article by Melissa Hogenboom about why not all screen time is the same for children.)\nBut Minotti stresses that his children have varied playtime \u2013 they love outdoor activities such as basketball, as well as video games. But sometimes, he has to remind them not to play video games excessively and he also steps in to approve any online friend requests. \"We don't just set them free on the internet,\" he adds.\nThe NSPCC, a children's charity in the UK, has published advice on how to keep kids safe when playing Minecraft and games like it. There have been serious cases of child grooming and abuse in Minecraft. The chief executive of Roblox also recently sparked a fierce debate after saying parents should keep their children off his company's gaming platform if they are worried about them being exposed to harmful content through its games.\nOverall, Minotti is comfortable with the fact that his children spend plenty of time in Minecraft because he says he has clear oversight of what they're doing and because they use it so creatively. \"It's basically just a digital playground,\" he says.\nMinecraft's broad appeal also means it provides an opportunity to connect with people in new ways.\u00a0 University professors, for example, used Minecraft to carry out online learning sessions during the early years of the Covid-19 pandemic. And primary school teachers in Ireland have reported success in engaging entire classes of pupils via Minecraft Education \u2013 a version of the game designed for classroom activities \u2013 says \u00c9adaoin Slattery, a lecturer in psychology at the Technological University of the Shannon Midwest. Her research, featuring interviews with 11 teachers in Ireland, was funded by Microsoft, which owns Minecraft.\nSlattery mentions one example of a teacher who decided to set up a game within Minecraft Education to help his students learn Gaelic. \"He talked about creating restaurants and different food in Minecraft \u2013 this would help the students learn different words,\" she says.\nSeparate research has found that using Minecraft in classrooms can heighten pupils' motivation for school tasks, problem-solving, reading and writing, among other skills. Perhaps educational activities in Minecraft are taking advantage of the \"flow state\", or high level of concentration and focus, that players enter when they become deeply engrossed in the game. This phenomenon is associated with lots of different activities but it is so prevalent among Minecraft fans that it has made them the subject of study. It is part of the reason why children can become so absorbed in the game while ignoring everything else that is going on around them.\nThat said, there is evidence that Minecraft is not universally engaging, and may have a gender imbalance. One study in Australia, which surveyed more than 700 parents, found that while 54% of boys aged three to 12 played Minecraft, only 32% of girls in that age group did. The study authors say that it is important for games and online platforms to engage girls just as much as boys \u2013 since those games help kids to develop the digital skills they will need later in life.\nAJ Minotti, for one, is not worried about his daughters struggling to get to grips with computers. \"Minecraft really has become their thing,\" he says. \"I have to ask them what's going on.\"\nAnd while his kids also enjoy making things with physical Lego bricks, for example, Minotti says they don't have room to store a tonne of Lego pieces at home. In the end, Minecraft offers an easy solution. \"It's just having all the Lego pieces you could ever imagine,\" he says.\n--\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to our Tech Decoded newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

This is why children can't get enough of it.AJ Minotti has three children \u2013 and they all love playing Minecraft. \"It's not surprising that natural selection endowed young people with a strong drive to play at building things,\" says Gray.He notes that children also play using language and imagination, or make games that have rules and social interaction at their heart \u2013 all seemingly as part of preparation for adulthood.What youngsters choose to build during playtime, and how they build it, tends to reflect the culture they live in, says Gray. Crucially, sandbox games \u00ad\u2013 video games such as Minecraft that offer players the freedom to explore their creativity without any particular goal \u2013 make it easy to interact with and do things on computers, says Togelius.",

        "article_text": "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.\nBack in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.\nThis is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.\nGothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.\nMeet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.\nIn 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.\nHowever, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.\nFredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.\n\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.\n\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"\nThe improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.\nKey initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.\nPublic housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.\n\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.\n\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.\n\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"\nBut Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.\n\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.\n\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"\nMs Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.\n\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.\nNegotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.\nSuch is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.\nMats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.\nHe says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.\n\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.\n\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"\nOne company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.\nIts binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.\nBy meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.\n\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.\n\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"\nBack in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.\n\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.\n\"I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.\"",

I will just keep doing what I am doing and hopefully get opportunities.\"\nMcKinney's height is now seen as an advantage, giving him the ability to attack lengths others would have to leave or defend, but it was not always this way.\nA talented footballer, he played for both Durham and Sunderland's academy as a teenager, having joined the Black Cats' ranks aged \"six or seven\".\n\"I was a centre-mid but I was getting a bit too tall for it,\" he says. \"I probably would have been a centre-back by now.\n\"I was always OK but didn't really enjoy it.\"\nMcKinney committed to cricket at the age of 16 \u2013 given confidence by Durham's production line which has overseen the development of Ben Stokes, Mark Wood, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison among others.\n\"I remember a phone call my dad had with [Durham's academy manager] John Windows,\" McKinney says.\n\"It went something like 'we have never let a lad fail from where he is now'.\n\"That was a massive confidence boost when you are 15 or 16 years old. That tipped me over the edge. My love was always cricket.\"\nThat love was first formed at Seaham Harbour Cricket Club, where his father Neil was one of the area's leading club cricketers. McKinney Sr also spent hours throwing to his son in the nets.\n\"He was relentless and wouldn't let me leave,\" McKinney says.\n\"Sometimes that might be bad but it definitely set me up for the future. It is amazing to have someone who cares for your success and you improving.\"\nDespite the promise, there has been no contact between McKinney and the England set-up, other than what he has been able to glean from having England skipper Stokes alongside him in the Durham dressing room.\n\"How he practises is something I have never seen before,\" McKinney says. \"He is so particular and there is always purpose.\"\nThe opportunities given to McKinney are no coincidence, however.\nHe was picked to open when warm-up opposition were provided to West Indies and Sri Lanka last summer and returned scores of 22, 46 and 20.\nHe also toured Australia with England Under-19s in 2023 - another relevant point with an Ashes series to come this winter - and hit 12 fours in a 45-ball 70 in England's victory in Brisbane, hinting at a keenness to follow the Bazball mantra from the start.\n\"It's actually the opposite,\" he says. \"My dad is very old fashioned. I used to bat 50 overs for 80. \n\"I used to love batting for time but somehow that flicked a switch, probably at a good time.\n\"There was a period I was probably going too hard but trying to find that balance of soaking up pressure and putting it back on has been the most important thing for my success this winter.\"\nThose words will be likely be a soothing symphony in the ears of England fans.\nTheir faith in England's approach is wobbling at the worst possible time with only a Test against Zimbabwe from 22 May to come before five against both India and Australia over the seven months that follow.\n\"I would love to play all formats but I go back to being 10 years old and watching Alastair Cook opening the batting,\" McKinney says.\n\"I loved the way he did it. It's not the road I have gone down now but the basics behind it, I will be happy keeping him as my role model.\"\nThere are no vacancies in England's top seven but Zak Crawley's poor form, Jacob Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments and the chance for injuries means nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\nMcKinney will get six County Championship matches to push his case further before Zimbabwe arrive, starting with a trip to Nottinghamshire on Friday.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nPundits on Rashford's MOTM performance against Preston\nMarcus Rashford has got his swagger back.\nThe Aston Villa loanee ended his 120-day goal drought with a second-half double at Preston on Sunday to help Unai Emery's side set up an FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace - and provide another clear sign he is enjoying his football again.\nFrozen out of the first-team picture at Manchester United by head coach Ruben Amorim just weeks after he replaced Erik ten Hag at the helm, even those closest to Rashford accepted he had a major point to prove when he completed his loan move to Aston Villa on 3 February.\nThose working with him can see the improvement in Rashford, maybe not quite to the levels of old but certainly a far cry from the passive figure he appeared at Old Trafford for most of the previous 18 months.\nEngland boss Thomas Tuchel must have felt so too, judging by the speed with which he restored Rashford to the international fold earlier this month.\nYet there were plenty of doubters. They were out in force on social media during the first half of Villa's 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory at Preston, as Rashford wasted a couple of free-kicks as the visitors struggled to turn their dominance into goals.\nThe only measure, though, of a striker's success is the regularity they hit the back of the net - and he hadn't done it for 14 games and counting since his double for United against Everton on 1 December.\nBut when Lucas Digne presented the opportunity 13 minutes into the second half at Deepdale, Rashford's innate ability did the rest as he calmly picked his spot before finding the bottom corner. \nFive minutes later, despite a wait for the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm Villa should be awarded a penalty, and goalkeeper David Cornell offering some 'advice' as he walked past to take up his position, Rashford's nerve held. He took his time, did an extended stuttering run-up, and found the net.\n\"The swagger is back,\" gushed Guy Mowbray in his Match of the Day commentary. \"The confidence and the pose.\"\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Rashford told BBC Sport afterwards: \"It's always nice for a forward to get a goal, so hopefully it continues.\n\"I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. I missed a lot of football before joining up with them. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now.\"\nFA Cup 'sparkle' returns - but will there be a 'fairytale ending'?\nRashford scores double as Aston Villa beat Preston in FA Cup quarters\nForest draw Bournemouth or Man City, Palace v Villa\nThis video can not be played\nRashford scores first Villa goals within space of five minutes\nThe deal United struck with Villa to let Rashford leave is not straightforward.\nThe precise nature of the loan deal is complicated. United have said 75% of Rashford's wages are being covered, although they have not explained exactly how. \nThat could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.\nThat, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League - Villa have been paired with French heavyweights Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals - as well as the FA Cup.\nUnai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957. \nIn addition, they are ninth in the Premier League, three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City, who occupy what is virtually certain to be the final Champions League spot.\nThat proliferation of targets underscores why Emery did not really want to talk about the likelihood of Villa triggering their \u00a340m option to turn Rashford's move into a permanent deal.\n\"We can't waste time speaking about that,\" he said\n\"If next year we are in the Champions League, in the Europa, or Conference League or not. Or we don't win a trophy - it is completely different.\"\nMarcus Rashford (left) celebrates his second goal for Aston Villa at Preston\nUnlike Villa, Rashford has won the FA Cup twice in recent memory, including last season. He has also been part of teams who have won the Europa League and EFL Cup. In addition, he has 60 England caps. His past playbook means if he can reach the standards he has previously set, he would be an asset to any side in the world.\nIt is that talent Emery is trying to coax out of the player. It is, in the modern football vocabulary, 'a process'.\nThe Aston Villa boss, said: \"There is still work, still weeks to get it, but today he did one step forward. He is feeling comfortable, getting confident and scoring goals. He was obviously getting better, but today it was more in his adaptation and helping us.\n\"He's playing in the idea, in the plan we did with him. He has played more as a winger on the left side but he's played in some moments as a striker. Today we decided to play him as a striker to his quality, his power and the way he exploits things. \n\"The process we have with him is more or less not changing. There is still work to do because he came here after not training consistently and not feeling in his best fitness. Progressively playing more and with the national team will help him to feel better and today was confirmation of that, which is good.\"\nThe painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United\nThe good thing from Rashford's perspective is he is beginning to put together a positive body of work to counter the extended period of drift he experienced at United.\nIt still feels bizarre he has left his boyhood club for a perceived smaller rival, yet finds himself entering the final two months of the campaign with substantially more to play for - both in number and prestige of competitions - than he would have had if he remained at Old Trafford.\nNo professional career is a straight line ascent, which is why insight from those who have been there and done it is so valuable.\n\"You are constantly being asked questions at the top,\" said former England keeper Joe Hart on Match of the Day.\n\"Maybe Rashford found himself in a lull but he has come to Villa with people around him that know what they are doing. He hasn't come here with question marks about how he is going to behave and what he is going to do and how he can change the team.\"\nHart found himself frozen out for a time at Manchester City and Micah Richards did not have the greatest time at Aston Villa.\nBut, like Hart, Rashford can see how a change of scenery has provided the impetus for improvement.\n\"He looks confident and happy,\" said Richards.\n\"It was a big move going to Villa. But when you've got a manager that believes in you, you can do special things.\n\"His whole body language looks a lot better and his all-round game was brilliant. That is the best way to shut people up. People were asking questions about not fulfilling his potential but that is the way to answer.\n\"I really like Rashford in these wide areas because he's always looking to run in behind.\nWhen I talk about body language and his movement - his all round game today was brilliant.\"\nGet Aston Villa news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "In the latest edition of Second Serve, our new weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the key talking points following the Miami Open.\nJannik Sinner isn't even allowed to play competitive tennis, yet he's still strengthened his grip as the world's leading men's player.\nSinner, of course, is almost halfway through a three-month ban for a doping offence, which ruled him out of the 'Sunshine Double' in Indian Wells and Miami.\nBut he watched on as his nearest rivals - Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz - both fumbled the chance to significantly narrow the gap at the top of the ATP rankings.\nIt looks increasingly likely Sinner will lead the way when he returns in Rome at the start of May.\nSinner still holds a lead of 2,685 ranking points over Zverev, while Alcaraz is 3,610 adrift.\nWith 1,000 points available to the Monte Carlo and Madrid champions, plus 500 for winning Barcelona or Munich, a slim opportunity for Zverev remains.\nSeizing the chance to overtake Sinner had been on Zverev's mind. Then he started, by his own admission, \"playing terrible\".\nSince losing in the Australian Open final, Zverev has won only six of 11 matches across the five tournaments he has played\nThe world number two was beaten by American qualifier Learner Tien in the Acapulco second round, 43rd-ranked Tallon Griekspoor in the Indian Wells second round, and France's Arthur Fils in the Miami Open fourth round.\n\"I have been losing a lot of matches that I feel like I couldn't control lately,\" Zverev said after his Miami exit.\n\"I have to look at myself more than anything else.\"\nAnd what about Alcaraz?

        "summary": "Second Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefingPublished31 March 202564 CommentsIn the latest edition of Second Serve, our new weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the key talking points following the Miami Open.Jannik Sinner isn't even allowed to play competitive tennis, yet he's still strengthened his grip as the world's leading men's player.Sinner, of course, is almost halfway through a three-month ban for a doping offence, which ruled him out of the 'Sunshine Double' in Indian Wells and Miami.But he watched on as his nearest rivals - Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz - both fumbled the chance to significantly narrow the gap at the top of the ATP rankings.It looks increasingly likely Sinner will lead the way when he returns in Rome at the start of May.Sinner still holds a lead of 2,685 ranking points over Zverev, while Alcaraz is 3,610 adrift.With 1,000 points available to the Monte Carlo and Madrid champions, plus 500 for winning Barcelona or Munich, a slim opportunity for Zverev remains.Seizing the chance to overtake Sinner had been on Zverev's mind. As we discussed in last week's Second Serve, he also has some soul-searching to do.Sinner is not the only one to have cemented his spot as the world's leading player this month - although Aryna Sabalenka has actually done it herself on the court.After winning Miami and finishing runner-up at Indian Wells, she has moved more than 3,000 points clear of second-placed Iga Swiatek in the WTA rankings.Sabalenka's dominance - having won the most matches this year (23) and reached the most finals (four) - will be secure until the French Open at the very least.What else happened in Miami?Novak Djokovic was denied his 100th ATP title as Czech teenager Jakub Mensik won a first - having almost pulled out of his opening match.Emma Raducanu played her best tennis since winning the 2021 US Open. Now she needs to build on her encouraging displays.Filipina teenager Alexandra Eala beat three Grand Slam champions, including second seed Swiatek, in a dream run to the semi-finals.That came after Swiatek was verbally abused by an \"aggressive and taunting\" fan during practice.Mensik's stock - and his ranking - has shot up after his exploits in Miami.Moving into the world's top 25 after his breakout run, the 19-year-old Czech is comfortably the biggest climber in the top 100.Jacob Fearnley is the new British number two after reaching the Miami second round, while Croatian former top-20 player Borna Coric made a notable jump after winning a Challenger title on home soil.Eala is the biggest climber in the WTA top 100, with Raducanu and Romania's Anca Todoni - a 20-year-old who won a WTA 125 title in Turkey - also enjoying significant rises.Many of the world's best are taking a week off as they change continents and surfaces before the European clay-court swing.But top American stars Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys will head a strong WTA field at the Charleston Open.Three ATP events take place in Houston, Marrakech and Bucharest, although only two of the world's top 20 - Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe - are in action.Women's singlesRaducanu's run to a first WTA 1,000 quarter-final was the biggest British story last week, while Sonay Kartal's recent rise continued as she secured another career high ranking of 61st.On the second-tier WTA 125 Tour, former British number one Heather Watson reached the semi-finals of the Puerta Vallarta Open in Mexico.In Vacaria, Brazil, 24-year-old Briton Fran Jones beat France's Leolia JeanJean 1-6 6-4 6-1 to win the W75 event - an ITF Women's World Tennis Tour event in the tier below the WTA Tour.Men's singlesWith Jack Draper, Jacob Fearnley and Cameron Norrie all out of Miami, attention turned to below the main tour.Former British number one Dan Evans lost in the first round of a Challenger in Naples, dropping out of the world's top 200 as a result.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have won two titles in their first full season togetherMen's doublesJulian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool demonstrated Britain's strength in depth by reaching their biggest final together.The sixth seeds had to settle for the Miami runners-up prize, however, after losing 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 to top seeds Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic.Women's doublesOlivia Nicholls and her Slovakian partner Tereza Mihalikova were unable to replicate their run to the Indian Wells final, going out in the second round in Miami.What is Second Serve?With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep up with everything from one week to the next.As part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest stories in the sport.As well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.You can also sign up to get the latest tennis news from BBC Sport delivered straight to your mobile phone.Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished31 January Then he started, by his own admission, \"playing terrible\".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Since losing in the Australian Open final, Zverev has won only six of 11 matches across the five tournaments he has playedThe world number two was beaten by American qualifier Learner Tien in the Acapulco second round, 43rd-ranked Tallon Griekspoor in the Indian Wells second round, and France's Arthur Fils in the Miami Open fourth round. \"I have to look at myself more than anything else.",

        "article_text": "As the list of nations issuing travel warnings to the US grows, some visitors are opting to boycott it entirely. Here's why many foreigners are changing their travel plans and what this could mean for Americans.\nAs President Donald Trump implements sweeping new policies, issues tariffs on longtime allies and leads an immigration crackdown, some international travellers are rethinking their travel plans to the US.\u00a0\nThe nation's stricter border enforcement has recently led to the detention of Canadian and European tourists, prompting Germany, the UK, Denmark, Finland and Portugal to issue travel warnings and advisories for the country. Now, it appears that a growing number of voices are advocating for an all-out boycott of travel to the US.\nThe cold shoulder has been particularly noticeable from the US's northern neighbour, Canada, which sends more than 20 million visitors to the country per year \u2013 more than any other nation. In response to Trump's proposed tariffs and repeated threats to annex the nation, former prime minister Justin Trudeau recently urged his fellow Canadians: \"Now is the time to choose Canada,\" adding, \"it might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada.\"\nThe appeal seems to have caught on, as many infuriated Canadians are now boycotting US holidays. In February, border crossings were down by more than 20%, according to Statistics Canada. The US Travel Association estimates that even a 10% reduction in Canadian visitors could result in $2.1bn in lost spending and 14,000 job losses.\nWhile some Canadians are snubbing the US because of policy changes, others say they simply don't feel as safe as they once did.\n\"My partner and I decided not to go ahead with our planned vacations to the US this year,\" said Canadian travel journalist Kate Dingwall. \"I worry about the border and getting stuck somehow, especially with how prickly Trump is to Canada. There's just a sense of uneasiness around visiting America at the moment.\"\u00a0\nKeith Serry, a writer and comedian based in Montreal, Quebec, cancelled five April appearances in New York City (including four shows at the upcoming New York City Fringe festival) due to the tense political situation.\n\"This decision will, of course, rob me of the opportunity to share my art with many of you in New York I've grown to know and love,\" he wrote on his Facebook page. \"That said, the honest truth is that I just don't feel safe travelling to the States right now. In addition, I feel a powerful disinclination to spending my money in any way that might aid the economy of a hostile state.\"\nIn recent months, some Canadians have faced tougher border security than ever before \u2013 even those with clean records and valid documents. One woman made international headlines as she was detained by ICE for two weeks in reportedly bleak conditions after her visa was revoked.\n\"We're a country that prides itself, imperfectly but intentionally, on values like inclusion, equity and human rights. When those values feel out of step with what's happening across the border, it becomes harder to justify participation,\" said Amar Charles Marouf, a Canadian citizen who works as a curator at the World Economic Forum. \"The political climate raises broader questions. What kind of treatment are we normalising? What assumptions are being made about who is welcome and who isn\u2019t?\"\nIt's not that Canadians aren't traveling internationally; many are simply swapping their traditional destinations. Marouf says Mexico, South America and Europe all feel more welcoming at the moment. \"California will be there when this is all over, but I just feel like there's less risk going to Portugal instead,\" added Dingwall.\nSome international properties have seen a bump in traffic, directly attributable to Canadians now spurning the US. \"In the last several weeks, we've received 10-plus leads from Canadians seeking to relocate events from the United States this summer,\" said Diarmaid O'Sullivan, director of sales & marketing at Hamilton Princess Hotel & Beach Club Bermuda. \"This is a mix of leisure travellers, including those planning weddings, and companies relocating business events. This represents an approximately 20% increase in forecasted revenue from the Canadian market.\"\nInterestingly, all of this is happening just as the US had been experiencing record growth in the travel and tourism sector. Marta Soligo, professor at UNLV and director of Tourism Research at the UNLV Office of economic development, points to The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC)'s 2024 Economic Impact Trends Report, which showed the US as the world's top travel and tourism market. Not only did the industry achieve an unprecedented economic impact of $2.36tn in the US, but the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projections indicate that the US economy will add more than 800,000 jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector.\n\"Such numbers help us understand the importance of the sector in the US, showing that a decrease in tourism from top-origin countries could significantly damage the US economy,\" said Soligo. \"The consequences of these issues can impact both large US-based corporations, such as hotel chains, and small businesses alike.\"\u00a0\nThe change in travel patterns is already having a tangible effect on the US economy. Tourism Economics recently updated its inbound US travel forecast from a predicted 8.8% growth, to a 5.1% decline, attributing the change to \"strained\" travel sentiment, \"sweeping tariffs\" and \"exchange rate shifts\" making travel to the US more expensive.\u00a0\n\"The combination of travel bans and a reduction of US travel could have a material impact on tourism and economic development,\" said Jeff Le, former deputy cabinet secretary for the State of California and the state's federal coordinator during the first Trump Administration.\nIn California alone, international visitors provided more than $24bn in local economies in 2023, reports Le. \"Losing this would likely hurt both people and local government funds,\" he said. \"It is harder to measure reputational loss, but I cannot imagine active boycotts help.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\n\u2022 The only land disputed between the US and Canada\n\u2022 The US island that once belonged to Russia\nWhile the broad impact of boycotting travel to the US could have substantial national and governmental effects, some advocacy organisations also warn that the loss of tourism dollars is most likely to be felt by individuals.\n\"It's US workers and small businesses who get affected by US travel boycotts,\" said Thomas F Goodwin, leader of the Exhibitions and Conferences Alliance. Goodwin notes that more than 99% of the US business and professional events industry is made up of small businesses, and more than 80% of all exhibitors are US and international small businesses. \"When international business travellers forgo coming to the US, everyone from exposition booth builders and general service contractors to venue caterers and individual skilled labourers suffer \u2013 not politicians or the government. Boycotts have a knock-on effect on hotels, taxis, restaurants, local entertainers, high street commerce and more.\"\nThere is also a cost that is harder to quantify: the global influence of American culture.\n\"Visitor numbers declining in the US sends a signal that the US is losing its soft power \u2013 the influence it once held through openness, cultural leadership and global goodwill,\" said Neri Karra Sillaman, entrepreneurship expert at the University of Oxford and author of the forthcoming book Pioneers: 8 Principles of Business Longevity from Immigrant Entrepreneurs. \"If this trend continues, it may force tourism boards or even local governments to create counter narratives to win back trust. I am not sure if it will be effective, however, since at the end of the day, it is the policies of the government that give the ultimate direction and influence perception.\"\u00a0\nSillaman notes that travel boycotts also have a long-term cost to culture, the economy and overall innovation. \"When academics, scientists, artists, designers and entrepreneurs start to choose other countries instead of US, the US is going to lose more than just visitors,\" she said. \"In the long term, it's going to lose its competitiveness, goodwill and it will turn into a closed society that stifles growth and innovation.\"\nThis human impact of boycotts also shows up in a myriad of ways, noted Missouri lawyer John Beck. \"I've worked with hundreds of non-citizens over the last 15 years and seen firsthand how policies between governments can result in individuals \u2013 regular travellers, students, families \u2013 getting caught in the middle,\" he said. \"It's rarely about the politics. It's about missed weddings, lost business deals or being unable to visit a dying parent.\"\nBeck says he has worked with at least 80 clients who have either delayed or cancelled US travel due to real or perceived hostility over the past few years. This causes complications with split families, international companies who can't move talent quickly and lost business due to the lack of ease of movement. Even though the geopolitical stakes are high, there is a human aspect on both sides of the border.\n\"Most Americans have little to do with the policies that frustrate global travellers,\" he said. \"They just want safety, fairness and dignity. That's what we need to protect.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

The rules under Uefa are complex and difficult to understand, but then again it's not guaranteed that Chelsea will be able to utilise these profits.Uefa tends to fine clubs for breaching the financial rules as opposed to on-field penalties, so if I was a Nottingham Forest or Everton fan I suspect I would feel very aggrieved, because they have been punished severely in terms of historical points deductions for spending money, but spending far less money than Chelsea.But the Premier League owners have decided to allow this particular feature and it does seem strange, but it's their ball and that's how they are choosing to play with it.Related topicsChelseaPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan viewsGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phonePublished26 July 2022 Punishments can come in the form of settlements or fines, but are unlikely to involve severe sporting sanctions.In 2022, Paris St-Germain were among the clubs to face substantial fines for breaching Uefa's FFP rules and were ordered to pay \u00a38.6m.Chelsea are fourth in the Premier League with nine games left to play, so will likely qualify for one of Uefa's three main competitions and face scrutiny under its jurisdiction.They also faced an \u00a38.6m fine over historic FFP breaches under Roman Abramovich in 2023, which remain under investigation by the Premier League.What do the experts say?Football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport:It's certainly an unprecedented level of profit which we've not seen before. At the same time, nobody's quite certain how much a women's team is worth.Chelsea had to submit their accounts to the Premier League by 31 December 2024.",

We are going to keep getting better. I really think we are going to take it to levels that we've not been to before.\n\"We are just going to keep pushing until we get to a point that we just can't imagine what is next.\"\nTwo of Kildunne's tries were relatively straightforward dot downs, with the third an instinctive finish from a kick-through.\nWhen the whistle sounded for the start of the second half, Kildunne had no tries. By  the 56th minute, her hand was above her head for yet another signature lasso celebration after a third score.\nKildunne made the most carries (16) and metres (145m) in the game, but it was her kicking game which stood out.\nFrom tidy deft chip-kicks to cause havoc in the backfield to grubber-kicks to turn the Wales defence, Kildunne has widened her game to be more than just a lethal counter-attack runner.\n\"She is starting to serve the team in different ways and there are going to be times that teams take away the counter-attack from her,\" England head coach John Mitchell told BBC Two.\n\"She is world-class with that plan A [running it back], but she is going to have to adapt in 2025 as certain teams will not allow her to get ball.\n\"We have to use her in the right way.\"\nWomen's Six Nations: England Thrash Wales\nWomen's Six Nations: Wales 7-26 England - bonus point secured in 27 minutes\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nKildunne made her England debut in 2018 as an 18-year-old\nKildunne was one of 13 changes Mitchell made to his starting XV from England's opening round victory over Italy, with the majority of his front-line starters returning.\nLike last weekend, the Red Roses ran away with the contest, scoring their bonus-point try inside 27 minutes.\nNumber eight Maddie Feaunati was named player of the match in York and further pressed her case to continue in the back row with two powerful finishes.\nWales-born Meg Jones scored the pick of England's 11 tries when she slalomed her way through her native country, showing incredible balance and footwork.\nJones, who was playing her first Red Roses match since both her parents passed away, pointed to the sky and tapped her chest before diving over the line.\n\"I haven't played here since I was 12 years old,\" Jones, 28, told BBC Two.\n\"When I heard both the anthems it took me a little bit.

Live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app\nWe are only two races into the 2025 Formula 1 season and there has already been a major driver change with Red Bull promoting Yuki Tsunoda to replace Liam Lawson.\nTsunoda competes at his home grand prix in Japan this weekend as team-mate to world champion Max Verstappen for the first time, with New Zealander Lawson demoted to Racing Bulls. \nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions on the Red Bull situation and more before the race in Suzuka.\nWhat would be a good season for Yuki Tsunoda after the recent driver switch? - David\nRed Bull's decision to demote Liam Lawson after just two races and put Yuki Tsunoda in the second Red Bull alongside Max Verstappen is nothing less than a career lifeline for Tsunoda.\nThe 24-year-old Japanese was staring at the likely end of his career this season.\nThat's because he owed his seat at the second Red Bull team to Honda, and it is moving to Aston Martin for 2026, where there is no seat available to Tsunoda and no realistic prospect of one.\nWithout Honda, the chances of Racing Bulls keeping Tsunoda for 2026 were slim, when there are other Red Bull juniors coming along the conveyor belt.\nSo a seat alongside Verstappen this year gives him the opportunity to show once and for all that he deserves a long-time place in F1.\nBut what level of performance would do that?\nThe fact remains that Red Bull have a minimum level of expectation for their second driver - and that's to be within about 0.3 seconds a lap of Verstappen on a consistent basis.\nThat's what Tsunoda needs to do to convince Red Bull that he deserves to be considered as a contender for a seat in 2026.\nAnd realistically if he does not do that, he is unlikely to convince anyone else that he is worth investing in either.\nThis video can not be played\nHorner won't ask me to swap if leading Verstappen - Tsunoda\nIf Max Verstappen leaves Red Bull are they in even greater trouble than just losing their star driver? It seems like they'd be losing the only person who can drive their car, a situation that's seemingly self-inflicted. Are they likely to be making their 2026 car more driveable to mitigate this risk? - Tom\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Lawson-Tsunoda driver swap is that it gives another perspective on the state Red Bull are in with their car.\nVerstappen believes it is the fourth quickest car in F1 at the moment - so behind the McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari. Although on average qualifying pace in the three sessions so far, it is actually second fastest behind the McLaren.\nBut it may be that it is only both of those things with Verstappen in it.\nThe issue for Red Bull is that they have one genius-level driver and one average one, in F1 terms - and that remains the case with Tsunoda in the second seat, or at least that's what most would believe right now.\nSo it's almost a case of split the difference between the drivers to judge the level of the car.\nThe bottom line seems to be that the new Red Bull is simply not that good a car, and certainly one which is unpredictable and does not generate confidence in a driver. Even Verstappen finds it difficult to drive - but he is so good that he is able to coax a good lap time out of it.\nVerstappen is regarded by most as the best driver in F1 at the moment - so if that's true, it stands to reason that the car would be worse with pretty much anyone else in it.\nIt seems Red Bull have chased peak aerodynamic performance at the expense of drivability - which is ironic, because that is exactly the opposite of the philosophy that Adrian Newey has championed throughout his career.\nLegendary designer Newey, who stopped working on Red Bull in F1 last April, and has just come to the end of his first month with Aston Martin, has always believed that it was better to have slightly less downforce that the driver can use all of, than more theoretical downforce that can't be accessed because the car is too \"peaky\". Or, as Lawson put it, the \"window\" is too narrow.\nLike all teams, Red Bull designed the best car they could for the new season. The question that hangs over them now is, do they know how to fix it?\nThis video can not be played\nRed Bull's second seat dilemma - F1 Breakdown\nAfter another very dry sprint race in China I wonder again why F1 doesn't give the teams tyres that enables the drivers to race through a sprint. Surely the point of the sprint is it is fast, exciting and full of action? - Richard\nThis is a question about tyre management. The fact is that - with a few very limited exceptions - drivers have never been able to race flat out since Pirelli entered F1 as the tyre supplier in 2011.\nThat's not how their tyres work. Pirelli tyres have to be managed to stay within a temperature window.\nDrive them flat out and they overheat. And if they overheat, they rarely come back to optimum grip level. Sometimes this is even the case over a single qualifying lap.\nPirelli has been asked before to provide tyres that can be driven flat out, but so far it has not done so.\nThis video can not be played\nSwapped seats & shaky starts: What to know before Japanese Grand Prix\nIs this season a write-off for Aston Martin? - Carlos\nIt's not looking good so far, is it?\nOn average, the Aston Martin is the seventh fastest car over a single lap over the first three races of the season, including the China sprint. Only the Alpine, Sauber and Haas have been slower.\nIt's fair to say that Fernando Alonso has not had his best start to a season, and mistakes in qualifying at both races so far have hurt the team's ultimate potential.\nSo, it's not completely clear yet what the car's ceiling is.\nAston Martin came into this season with two main aims - to produce a more drivable car, and to prove that they could solve the correlation issues they have had between simulation and the real world and design upgrades that perform as expected.\nThe drivers say that it is more drivable than last year - it's just not that quick.\nIf they can prove their upgrades work, then the season will be at least a qualified success, regardless of the performance of the car to some extent.\nSo it is probably fair to wait for at least the first upgrade package - which would typically be expected around May some time - before forming any firm conclusions.\nHow to follow Japanese Grand Prix on the BBC\nTsunoda told to be 'as close to Verstappen as possible'\nIs there a circuit(s) you'd really want on the calendar that currently isn't on there? And at the expense of which current circuit(s)? I love Fuji and I'm not a fan of street circuits \u2013 RAP\nThe F1 calendar has a pretty good selection of circuits at the moment.\nThere are some obvious candidates in the United States - Road America and Laguna Seca are both great circuits. But then so is Austin, and both Miami and Las Vegas work for the sport on a financial level.\nBathurst in Australia is awesome - but not suitable for F1, sadly.\nAs for Fuji, great backdrop, when the clouds are not covering Mount Fuji, but as a circuit it is not a patch on Suzuka.\nThe one big miss in terms of the calendar is France. Somehow, it seems wrong not to have a grand prix in the country that gave birth to motorsport and hosted the first race with that title, even if Monaco is regarded as a sort of proxy French race.\nThe problem is that France's only circuits with licences for F1 are Paul Ricard and Magny-Cours. Uninspiring both.\nBut if the Sarthe circuit at Le Mans could be brought up to F1 standard and host a grand prix, that would be quite something.\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nWhat's the future for F1 engines and why is it up for debate?",

Waltz recently sparked a media frenzy after inadvertently adding a prominent journalist to a high-level group chat about the US strikes in Yemen. \nThat Waltz's job may now be in jeopardy is just one reason Tuesday's contest for one of the 435 House seats is now a national story.\nThe other is that Weil, despite running in a district Trump carried by more than 30 points last November, just might win. And if he does, Democrats would take a big step closer to a majority in the narrowly divided House.\nWin or lose, the race also could serve as a barometer of voters' motivation as Trump begins his second term \u2013 and offer hints at the political landscape ahead of next year's mid-term congressional elections.\nIt is one of two special elections in Florida on Tuesday. The other, in Florida's panhandle region, will determine a replacement for Matt Gaetz, the firebrand congressman Trump originally picked to be attorney general before he withdrew  under a cloud of sexual misconduct and ethics allegations. A Republican is widely expected to win there.\nBut that is not the case here. Weil has raised about $10m in campaign donations, dwarfing the $1m brought in by Fine, a Florida state senator.\nAccording to a recent public opinion survey, Weil narrowly trails Fine. An internal poll by a respected Republican firm reportedly showed Weil ahead by 3.\nThat's enough to cause more than a little anxiety in Republican ranks.\n\"There's no excuse for a Republican not to win this race,\" said Randy Ross, a Florida-based conservative activist who campaigned there for Trump in 2016 and 2024. \"The only excuse that can possibly be had is Republicans weren't excited and didn't get out to vote.\"\nMr Ross added that Republican voters need to understand that Fine will support Trump's agenda in Congress \u2013 and Weil will not.\nTo this end, some of the party's heaviest hitters stepped in to help. Last Thursday, Trump joined the Republican candidate in two telephone town hall events. On Monday night, Florida Congressman Byron Donalds and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro held their own event.\n\"Donald Trump's agenda is hanging by a thread,\" Shapiro said. \"This is a district that simply cannot fall into Democratic hands.\"\nTech multi-billionaire Musk, a close Trump ally, may be campaigning in person for a hotly contested Wisconsin Supreme Court race, but his political committee directed more than $75,000 to support Fine in recent days. Other conservative groups followed suit, helping Fine level the financial playing field.\nOf particular concern for the party is that special elections take place during times of lower political engagement and usually involve only the one race in question. They often tilt toward the party with the most enthusiasm, according to Mr Ross. For Republicans, a Democratic show of strength on Tuesday would be troubling.\n\"You can't go just on name recognition in a special election,\" he said. \"You've got to drive people out to vote for you.\"\nRepublican nervousness is a result of simple math in the House of Representatives. With a 218 to 213 majority in the 435 seat chamber, the party cannot afford to lose any winnable elections \u2013 let alone ones that should be a slam dunk. \nWhile a Weil victory alone wouldn't be enough to flip control of the chamber, two of the currently vacant seats are in safely Democratic districts. If the results of those special elections go as expected, Democrats would be on the verge of control.\nThat could explain why the president announced on Friday he was withdrawing his pick of New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be US ambassador to the United Nations, despite her having all but formally vacated her office. A Weil victory on Tuesday would mean the Republicans could not afford to lose a New York election to replace Stefanik.\nEven before Tuesday's balloting, both Democrats and Republicans jockeyed to frame the results in the best light for their party.\nConservatives downplayed the national implications of the race and placed blame on Fine, who has been accused of running a lacklustre campaign and taking victory for granted.\n\"It's a reflection of the candidate that's running the race, \" Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said of Fine's apparent underperformance.\nMeanwhile, Democrats are declaring a victory \u2013 at least, the moral variety.\n\"These are races that should not, under ordinary circumstances, be on anyone's political radar,\" Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said last Monday. \"The American people are not buying what the Republicans are selling.\"\nThat sentiment was echoed by many of Weil's supporters on Monday night in Ocala, even if the candidate himself told the BBC he would win by eight points.\n\"If we lose but come close, moderate Republicans might take notice,\" said Buddy Oswald, an attorney and educator. If they were worried their party could lose a safe seat, he added, maybe they would feel the heat and be more willing to break with the president.\nEight years ago, in the aftermath of Trump's stunning 2016 presidential victory, Democrats sought solace in special election races across the map. They pulled off some stunners, including a Doug Jones Senate victory in deeply conservative Alabama. In other races, such as a bid by Jon Ossoff in a suburban Atlanta district, the Democrat came up just short.\nThose races presaged a high level of Democratic enthusiasm that led to a wave in the mid-terms the following year, when the party won 39 seats in taking back the House of Representatives and putting a decisive end to Trump's first-term legislative agenda.\nRepublicans, with convincing victories on Tuesday, want to squelch any chance of history repeating itself.\nDemocrats, engaged in a sometimes acrimonious debate over strategy and political priorities, would like Florida to get them back in the win column \u2013 or at least give them hope of better days to come.",

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy was also there.\nThe prime minister told them the show was \"at times harrowing\" but had \"lit a touch paper\" under the debate about the issues.\n\"We've been watching with our children - my boy is 16, my girl is 14 - and I have to say, I found it really hard,\" he told BBC political editor Chris Mason.\nIt was so arresting, he said, because \"in a sense, what happens in the drama could really happen anywhere, and almost happen to any child\".\nIt shone a light \"on misogyny, on online content, and this sense of children, particularly boys, getting drawn in to this world\", he said.\nBut unlike some things the government deals with, \"there isn't an obvious policy response which will answer all of these questions\", he added.\n\"It's much broader than that. It's a cultural issue, and therefore we're going to have to look more broadly, work as a society on this, and discuss it, which is why I'm really pleased that Adolescence is now going to be shown in schools free because I do think young people should be watching it.\"\nNetflix announced that the drama would be available to all UK secondary schools through the Into Film+ schools streaming service.\nAsked about banning phones in schools, which has also been proposed by the Conservative opposition, he said 97% of schools were already doing that - so it was \"not, to my mind, the central issue\".\n\"If we're going to get to grips with this, I personally would much rather we focus on what I think is the real issue, which is, whether you're at school or elsewhere, what are you actually accessing?

        "article_text": "Charlotte Edwards was the first England captain to lead in more than 200 internationals \nEngland have appointed legendary former captain Charlotte Edwards as their new head coach.\nThe 45-year-old, England's all-time leading run-scorer, replaces Jon Lewis, who was sacked in March after the 16-0 Ashes hammering in Australia.\nEdwards played more than 300 times for England in a 19-year career, including in excess of 200 games as captain.\nIn a 10-year spell in charge, Edwards won three Ashes series and both the 50-over and 20-over World Cups in 2009.\nShe was surprisingly sacked in 2016 and replaced by Heather Knight, who then enjoyed her own nine-year reign.\nKnight was also sacked in the aftermath of the Ashes debacle but will remain as a player, now under coach Edwards.\n\"I cannot wait to take this team forward and drive us to success. It means the world to me to have the three lions on my chest once again,\" said Edwards.\n\"Leading England as captain was my life for 10 years and I will forever be passionate about this team and our legacy. We have such a talented group of players, and I am excited about working with them and improving them both as individuals and as a team.\"\nEngland are yet to name a new captain. Vice-captain Nat Sciver-Brunt has previously stated she would be interested in the role, while off-spinner Charlie Dean said she \"wouldn't say no\".\nThe upheaval at the top of the England team comes as a result of a review into the Ashes, led by director of women's cricket Clare Connor.\nRealistically, Edwards was the standout candidate to lead a rebuild, with Connor describing her as a \"proven winner\". Following her stellar playing career, she has enjoyed considerable success as a coach.\nHer Southern Vipers have been the strongest team in English domestic cricket and Edwards' Southern Brave won the women's Hundred in 2023.\nOverseas, Edwards has led Mumbai Indians to two titles in three seasons at the Women's Premier League in India. In 2022, Edwards' Sydney Sixers were beaten in the final of Australia's Big Bash.\n\"When we drew up the criteria for the job it became apparent very quickly that Charlotte was the outstanding candidate,\" Connor added.\n\"She has the experience, passion and expertise to lead this team to success. The results she has achieved as a head coach in multiple environments, since retiring as one of the greatest ever England players, is testament to her relentless drive and the standards she sets for those around her.\n\"She is a proven winner; she has won repeatedly as a player and now as a coach. She possesses a deep knowledge of the game, both in England and across the world, and she understands the importance of creating an environment that is both challenging and supportive.\"\nEdwards will lead England in home white-ball series against West Indies and India this summer, building up to the 50-over World Cup in India in October.\nEdwards' former England team-mate Lydia Greenway, who has also coached with her at Mumbai, is confident the appointment will move England \"in the right direction\" after a difficult two years. \nA thrilling drawn Ashes in the summer of 2023 gave a sense of optimism under Lewis, but the two T20 World Cup disappointments either side of that and this year's thrashing to Australia left the team at a new low.\n\"The one thing with Lottie is the standards she sets, and what she expects of you as a player,\" Greenway told BBC Sport. \"Straight away, I've got no doubt in my mind that she'll go into that group and set out her expectations and her standards from the word go. \n\"I think everyone should be really excited by this appointment. We don't know whether there will be the success that we want, but what we do know is she'll move things in the right direction.\" \nOf the five domestic or franchise teams that Edwards has coached since 2020, they have finished in the top three of the group stages in their respective competitions in 16 of the 19 attempts. \nGreenway cautioned that Edwards would need to be given time to \"embed her style\" but the relationships that she has forged with England's players during her coaching tenure so far will be crucial. \nDean and opening batter Maia Bouchier have played for Southern Vipers under Edwards, spinner Sophie Ecclestone linked up with her at Sydney Sixers while experienced batters Danni Wyatt-Hodge and Knight played under her captaincy.\n\"It was one of the questions prior to the last cycle of recruiting a head coach: was it too soon for her to be working with some of her former teammates,\" Greenway said.\n\"But we're in a position where she's already gone through that experience of working with them and she's established herself now as a coach.\n\"When you go from playing to coaching, it does take you a while to get used to what your role is, so she's managed to navigate that journey already and she's clearly ready for it.\"\nKnight sacking leaves 'enormous shoes to fill' - who may England turn to?\nWhat next for England after Lewis' sacking?\nBy Ffion Wynne, BBC Sport journalist\nIn the end, Edwards' appointment felt almost as inevitable as the sackings of Lewis and Knight which came before her. \nThere were murmurings of her potentially taking the vacancy before Lewis took the role in 2022, but Edwards wanted a little more time to establish herself in domestic cricket and around the franchise circuit. \nShe has done that with so much success, and Mumbai Indians' second Women's Premier League win just a couple of weeks ago felt poetic, like the cricket world was serving the ECB with a timely reminder of what and who was waiting for them.\nThere, she has also established a relationship with Sciver-Brunt, which could be crucial if the all-rounder is named as England's next captain. \nEdwards has a monumental rebuilding task on her hands, not only in developing the new captain but essentially, she needs to rebrand the team altogether. \nA humiliating month in Australia saw the team's fitness and athleticism questioned - not for the first time, either. Their attitude was criticised, fans accused them of not caring enough and there was tension between players and the media, too. \nCombined with how performances have stagnated on the pitch, particularly in the field and the inability to perform under pressure, Edwards has got her work cut out.\nBut those who know her best, including both Greenway and Dean, say there is nobody better suited to taking on a challenge. \nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

Charlie Atkinson broke easily through a tackle and with Harris inside he scored next to the posts.\nNothing was going Bristol's way as Byrne's kick to restart into the swirling wind went straight out and from a Cherry and Whites scrum on halfway, the ball was passed out wide to Hathaway who raced downfield. \nHis long ball back inside was expertly picked out of the air one-handed by a jumping Tomos Williams, whose no-look pass then found Seb Atkinson to run under the posts for the crucial fourth score to make it 24-0.\nGloucester's win at Kingsholm followed another high-scoring win at Ashton Gate earlier this season\nBristol director of rugby Pat Lam said during the week that he thought the match-up between two of the most potent sides in the league could be \"one of the best\" and at times both defences could barely keep up.\nBristol got themselves on the board as Benhard Janse Van Rensburg bouldered through and Harry Randall picked the ball quickly, to find Fitz Harding to dive under the posts.\nRich Lane then came within a whisker of the line before Williams scored Bristol's second to close the gap to 24-14.\nYet Gloucester were soon back at the other end as Hathaway darted between two tacklers and found Atkinson in space to slide over. \nThe tries continued to trade back and forth as Max Lahiff  powered over for Bristol's third from close range.\nBut Gloucester were not done and with the clock in red on 42 minutes they created space for Wade to dive over for a sixth in the corner.\nGloucester's intensity did not relent as the second half began and Wales scrum-half Williams caught Bristol's line unawares, throwing a long ball from a penalty to Atkinson who bundled over for his hat-trick.\nWade then chased his own kick past two Bristol players to tap down his own third try, and Barton then got in on the act after coming on as a replacement with Gloucester's ninth.\nThe win was out of Bristol's reach but they scored a crucial fourth to ensure they took something from the trip up the M5 through Williams, who muscled over under a tackle.\nGloucester director of rugby George Skivington told BBC Sport: \n\"I do think we were brilliant in defence, I know we conceded four tries but our defence was brilliant. Set-piece was very clinical. \n\"Attack-wise, we've scored a lot of tries this year but there has been times we've scored four and then the game has sort of gone along, we've not deliberately been conservative but I think scoring those three tries straight after the break was as good as we have been.\n\"I think Lightsy [James Lightfoot-Brown, attack coach] is really paying off there and the boys are really enjoying it. It is hard work, Lightsy's very on his detail - it's not lucky. It's just rewards to James and to all the boys.\"\nBristol director of rugby Pat Lam told BBC Sport:\n\"Well done to Gloucester, they were superb tonight, definitely their night and great to see so many young Gloucester kids and supporters enjoyed the game. \n\"I think we worked our way back 29-21 just before half-time and then we conceded again.\n\"At half-time we talked about how we have got to start fast and we turned the ball over from the kick-off and got a chance to get into it, and if we scored there we're back in the game but we turned the ball over and Gloucester scored.\n\"Not a great night defensively but we'll take the one point, the season ebbs and flows. The journey towards the end of May, June is not always easy one but you learn along the way. Our main thing is we got one point out, we'll dust ourselves off, we've got five more [games] to get into those play-offs.\"\nGloucester: Carreras; Wade, Harris, S. Atkinson, Hathaway; C.

        "article_text": "Wisconsin voters have elected a Democratic-backed judge to serve on the state supreme court, according to projections, following the most expensive judicial election in US history.\nSusan Crawford is on course to beat conservative rival Brad Schimel, which would keep intact the 4-3 liberal control of the Midwestern state's highest court. \nPresident Donald Trump's billionaire adviser Elon Musk was a prominent fundraiser in the campaign, and was the subject of Democratic attack ads. More than $100m (\u00a377m) was spent by the candidates and their allies, including $20m by Musk.\nThe result is expected to have far-reaching implications, potentially even affecting the balance of power in the US Congress.\nThat is because the state's supreme court is expected to play a key role in cases related to congressional redistricting ahead of midterm elections in 2026 and the next presidential election, in 2028.\nWith the majority of ballots tallied, Crawford had won about 54% of the vote, and Schimel had around 45%, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.\nAddressing the fundraising by Musk, Crawford told supporters in her victory speech: \"Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. Our courts are not for sale.\"\nThe Dane county judge was formerly a private lawyer for Planned Parenthood and she backed abortion rights during her campaign.\nAfter giving his personal backing to Schimel, Tuesday's result was a setback for Trump in a crucial swing state that he won by less than a percentage point during last November's presidential election.\nHowever, he took consolation from fellow Republicans managing to hold on to two congressional seats in Florida elections on Tuesday. \nThe contest was seen as a test of Musk's powerbroking status. The SpaceX and Tesla boss travelled to the state to give out millions of dollars to voters who pledged to support conservative causes. \nIn celebrating Crawford's win, Democrats framed her victory as Musk's defeat. \n\"Wisconsin cannot be bought. Our democracy is not for sale. And when we fight, we win,\" Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote in a post on social media.  \nMusk addressed the defeat of his candidate in a post on his social media site X, writing: \"I expected to lose, but there is value to losing a piece for a positional gain.\"\nIn the city of Milwaukee, which leans Democratic, officials reported a shortage of ballots on Tuesday \"due to unprecedented and historic voter turnout\", the city's election commission said in a statement.\nWisconsin separately voted on Tuesday to enshrine into the state constitution a law requiring voters to show ID to cast their ballots. \nVoters were already required to show ID, but adding it to the state constitution made it harder to change in the future. Crawford had opposed the voter ID constitutional amendment. \nAt an NBA game in Milwaukee on Tuesday, several voters spoke to the BBC about their concerns.\nMilwaukee Bucks fan Mike McClain said he was motivated by a dislike for Musk, who he referred to as \"the real president\".\n\"I don't know how a billionaire, almost a trillionaire, can decide what's going on,\" he said. \"You can't even relate with common people.\"\nCrawford also benefited from large donations by billionaire donors, including financier George Soros, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. But Musk outspent them all.\nA Schimel supporter who did want to give his name said he was supporting the conservative out of loyalty to Trump. \n\"We got to take it back home here and reinforce everything that Donald Trump has done,\" he said.\nMuch of the liberal campaign focused on the role played by Musk in the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), a cost-cutting taskforce that has moved to fire thousands of government workers and slash the federal payroll.\nDuring a rally on Sunday, Musk distributed two $1m cheques to voters at a rally who signed a petition of his against \"activist judges\". \nOthers who signed it received $100 from Musk. \nOn Tuesday, Musk's political action committee added that it would pay $50 to anyone who snapped a picture of a Wisconsin resident standing outside a polling site and holding a photo of Schimel.\nMusk donated more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump to the White House. He held similar $1m giveaways to boost the Republican president's campaign last year.\nWisconsin's supreme court is expected to play a key role in determining the shape of congressional districts if Democrats seek to challenge current district maps as they are widely expected to do.\nRepublicans currently hold six of the state's eight seats in the US House of Representatives.\nAt his rally on Sunday, Musk alluded to the looming fight over congressional districts, saying the judicial race was ultimately about control of the US House of Representatives, where Republicans currently hold a narrow majority.\nThat slender margin was shored up on Tuesday in special congressional elections in Trump's political heartland of Florida. \nRepublican candidates Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine held on to those ruby-red seats in races that were seen as a barometer of the political landscape ahead of next year's Midterm elections.",

        "article_text": "England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson will again caddie for Lottie Woad at the Augusta National Women's Amateur tournament\nIt was while standing on the 12th tee at Augusta National that Lottie Woad had one of those 'pinch me' moments.\nThe English amateur, from Farnham in Surrey, was seven holes away from securing a career highlight win that would kick-start a stellar 2024.\nIt was a year that started with her becoming the first European to claim the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA) title at the home of the Masters - a title she will try to become the first to defend this week when the three-day competition starts on Wednesday.\nIt was a year in which the England Golf women's squad member played in her first majors, finished as top Briton at the Women's Open, helped win the Curtis Cup, and ended it as the world's number-one-ranked amateur.\n\"It was definitely a breakthrough year,\" the 21-year-old tells BBC Sport. \"Winning at Augusta was the highlight and that kicked off the whole year.\"\n\"I have respect for everyone playing the 12th hole because it looks bigger than it actually is, but there is not much room. It's probably like 20 feet deep max.\"\nAnd it was on the back nine at Augusta - where so many Masters dreams have flourished and floundered - that Woad managed to keep her nerve.\nThe 12th was among the pivotal holes and she had to steady herself to tackle one of the most daunting par-threes in golf.\nDozens of rounds have been ruined on this most picturesque of holes. Tiger Woods hit three balls in Rae's Creek, the water that protects the front of the green, on his way to a 10 in 2020, the year after he won his fifth Green Jacket.\n\"You're standing on the tee and you're just like, 'I'm on hole 12',\" she says.\n\"You're nervous but then you're also going 'I'm playing the 12th at Augusta', so it's not too bad.\"\nWoad, who went into the final round of the 54-hole event - of which the first 36 are played at the nearby Champions Retreat Golf Club - with a two-shot lead, marked a three on her card to stay at six under. \nBut up ahead American Bailey Shoemaker was putting the finishing touches to the first bogey-free round at Augusta in the five-year history of the ANWA. A sensational 66 set a target of seven under.\nA bogey on the par-five 13th meant Woad dropped two behind, but she produced a magical finish with three birdies in her final four holes to snatch victory on the final green.\nThe putt on the 18th was an 18-footer, downhill.\n\"It didn't have much break but it was pretty quick,\" she says.\n\"Then it went in and I've won at Augusta and everyone kind of went crazy.\"\nWoad's season was about to get a little more crazy. The victory opened the door to play the majors, the Chevron Championship two weeks later being the first.\nShe spent a hectic week catching up with friends and college work at Florida State University, where she is in the penultimate year of a sports management degree, before heading to Texas.\n\"My parents and coaches were at Augusta and they wanted to go home, so I was left on my own at my first major,\" she says.\n\"I had to get a local caddie, but I had a lot of confidence from Augusta, made the cut and was in contention.\" \nWoad finished joint 23rd, alongside England's Georgia Hall and Charley Hull, two of her \"favourite players\" that she had \"looked up to\" since concentrating on the sport from about the age of 13.\nShe had taken her first lessons, aged seven, with Farnham pro Luke Bone, who remains her coach.\nProgression to the England Girls followed by the age of 15 and, while perhaps not seen as the most naturally gifted golfer, Woad's work ethic impressed as she took advantage of resources not previously available to her.\n\"I had a putting coach, a strength and conditioning coach and a psychologist,\" she says.\n\"I was always pretty good at the long game, but I had to work a lot harder on my short game and I learned how to practise more effectively.\"\nShe went on to win the prestigious Girls Amateur Championship at Carnoustie in 2022, a decade after Hall triumphed in the event.\nWoad was back in Scotland for last year's Women's Open, which was held over the Old Course in St Andrews.\nShe had missed the cut at the US Women's Open and Evian Championship but arrived in Fife in buoyant mood for her fourth major.\nWoad would be in contention all week and finish joint 10th to win the Smyth Salver as the highest-placed amateur, with another highlight being a 60-yard chip-in eagle two on the par-four last in round three.\n\"That got me back into the top 10 going into final day. It was a really cool moment with the grandstand full of cheering people,\" she says.\n\"Then at the prize-giving I get to stand next to the winner, Lydia Ko. To see her lift that trophy motivates you.\n\"It was a perfect week. Home of golf, first Open - I couldn't have dreamed it better.\"\nThere was little time for celebration, though. The Curtis Cup, which pits Great Britain and Ireland's top female amateurs against their American counterparts, was the following week.\nThe Americans were favourites to win a fourth successive title after domineering victories in the previous three editions of the biennial event.\nBut GB&I were boosted by having Europe's victorious Solheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew as their leader.\nAnd Woad, who grew up 40 minutes from the Sunningdale Old Course that hosted the event, contributed 2\u00bd points in a nerve-shredding 10\u00bd-9\u00bd triumph.\nBy that point, Woad had ascended to top of the amateur rankings, which earned her the Mark H McCormack medal. Ko won the prize three successive times from its inception in 2011, while Ireland's Leona Maguire and rising US star Rose Zhang are also three-time recipients.\nSo what does 2025 hold for Woad?\nThe 'P' word is unavoidable, even if Woad will \"only be making that decision when I get to it\".\nTurning professional would appear to be the next logical step and Woad is on an LPGA pathway that could help accelerate that process.\n\"You can get an LPGA card when you reach 20 points and I'm currently on 16,\" she says. \"I'm trying to get 20 points this year and then we'll have a decision to make.\n\"If you make a cut in a major you get a point. If you get a top-25 finish you get a point. If you win Augusta or NCAAs (National Collegiate Athletic Associations), you get two points.\n\"I'm trying to not think too much about it. But if I play well I'm going to get those points.\"\nThe NCAAs are the pinnacle of collegiate golf in the US, pitting teams and individuals against each other. Woad finished runner-up in the individual competition last year, while her university team were joint 11th.\nThis season, Woad has posted an impressive eight consecutive top-three finishes since September. But her Florida State team-mate, 19-year-old Malaysian Mirabel Ting, has eclipsed that, winning six events since last year's AWNA to lead the NCAA individual rankings.\nJasmine Koo is also in a field which boasts 49 of the top 50 in the world. Over the past 12 months the number two ranked player has had four wins and seven top-five finishes.\nAnd 16-year-old Asterisk Talley is tipped to feature again. She finished joint eighth last year and went on to beat Woad in the singles at the Curtis Cup as she also enjoyed a superb 2024.\nHowever, Woad goes into the week knowing that she has conquered Augusta National before and she will again have England Golf women's lead coach Steve Robinson on the bag.\n\"That's going to be nice, to have that familiarity,\" she says. \"I'm just really excited. It's going to be a fun week, and hopefully I can be the first to defend the title.\"",

        "article_text": "Usher has kicked off a 10-night residency at London's O2 Arena with a slick, two-hour show that was impressive and frustrating in equal measure.\nThe US pop star played more than 40 songs, including hits like Yeah, Burn, U Remind Me and OMG, with multiple costume changes and buttery-smooth choreography.\nBut the show, which comes to the UK after a 62-date run in the US, felt oddly rough around the edges - including a handful of on-stage stumbles and missed musical cues.\nThe momentum was frequently torpedoed by waffly, overlong video interludes - but Usher's magnetic stage presence just about held the concert together.\nTitled \"Past, Present, Future\", the tour is billed as an \"intimate\" look at Usher Raymond IV's 30-year career, as well as \"a glimpse into the future\".\nIt comes as the star, one of the best-selling artists of the 2000s, is enjoying a career rebirth - following an acclaimed Super Bowl half-time show, and the release of his ninth studio album, Coming Home.\nWith 10 sold-out shows at the O2, he enters an elite group of artists who've played double-digit residencies at the venue, alongside Queen (10 shows in 2022), Bon Jovi (12 nights in 2010) and Prince (21 nights in 2007).\n\nAt its core, Past, Present, Future illustrates the skill with which the 46-year-old has navigated the evolving trends of the music industry.\nWe see a video clip of him, aged 14, dancing to his debut single, Call Me A Mack, then watch as he transforms into a teenage heartthrob, a confessional balladeer, an EDM party-starter, and an elder statesman of R&B.\nHe arrives from under the stage in a fog of dry ice and a cone of laser beams, apparently controlling the lights with his bare hands, before dancing to the middle of the arena with the molten fluidity of his idol, Michael Jackson.\nClad in a sparkly raincoat and wide-brimmed Pharrell hat, he races through hits like Coming Home, Hey Daddy and U Make Me Wanna, backed by a funky 10-piece band and a dance team that echoes his every move.\nThe choreography is a constant highlight. Usher's moves are so effortless that they look unrehearsed, but such ease comes at a cost: Last year, he had to postpone the start of the tour after injuring his neck in practice.\nAt the O2, that pain seemed a distant memory, as he careened around the U-shaped stage on roller skates, pulling off a flawless moonwalk, and even freeze-framing in a handstand.\nHe might have fumbled a hat at one point, but it was one of his dancers who came closest to calamity - losing his balance during an elaborate chair routine, sending the chair spinning across the stage.\nThe band also suffered a mishap, missing Usher's cue to extend the intro to Superstar, and coming in four bars early. Not disastrous, but still unusual for a show on this level.\nThe hits were punctuated by numerous interludes, narrated by Celeste, a glitch-prone \"computer driven by AI technology to help Mr Raymond tell his story\",  from teen wannabe to global superstar, against a backdrop of infidelity, tabloid infamy, redemption and survival.\nThe problem was his songs couldn't support the weight of that story. With a few exceptions, Usher mostly sings about lusting after women in the club, and carnal pleasures in the bedroom.\nThe result was a weirdly disconnected show, where Usher followed a moving video about his absent father with a song about his ex, which he sung while straddling a motorbike.\nPriapism was a running theme. Women in the audience were fed with cocktail cherries (\"oh, it's your first time?\" Usher mugged into the camera)  and part of the stage was turned into a strip club, complete with pole dancers, during Bad Girl.\nThat sort of tongue-in-cheek raunch has been a hallmark of Usher's career, but it felt dated and shallow in a concert that promised an intimate look into his personality. \nPerhaps he just wanted us to know that, deep down, he really, really likes sex.\n\nLuckily, the songs still hold up. A trio of quiet storm ballads - Climax, Burn and Confessions Part II - had couples serenading each other, while a trio of women near me took the opportunity to slow dance a security guard who was mopping the floor.\nTo his credit, Usher sang everything live, with an airy falsetto that's undiminished after 30 years on tour. During U Got It Bad, he held one sustained note for over 10 seconds.\nAt times, he struggled to hold the audience's attention during the slow jams. The UK has always preferred him in club mode - and it was his three biggest-sellers, Yeah, OMG and DJ Got Us Falling In Love that really set the O2 alight.\nStrangely it was one of those empty club anthems, I Am The Party, that ultimately carried the most meaning.\n\"Hopefully my [music] has been something to you,\" Usher said over the introduction.\n\"Maybe we fell in love together, maybe we had a good time together, but something brought you here. And I just want you to know, I appreciate the connection.\"\n\"If I didn't have you to cheer me on, I wouldn't continue to do this.\"\nPop stars say this sort of thing all the time. But as he stood at the O2, drenched in sweat, remembering the father who abandoned him and soaking up the audience's affection, Usher didn't seem to be putting on an act.\nBy the encore, he'd given up all pretence of being a high-rolling playboy. \nInstead, he bounded around the stage, giddily filming the audience on his phone, as they hollered out the chorus to Without You.\nIf only that performer had shown up earlier.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nKildunne's hat-trick against Wales\n\"I haven't even scratched the surface of my potential.\"\nThose were the words of England full-back Ellie Kildunne in November when she was named World Rugby's women's player of the year.\nThe 25-year-old scored 14 tries in nine tests for the Red Roses last term, and it looked, on the outside, as though maintaining form before a home Rugby World Cup - which starts in August - was all she needed to do.\nBut Kildunne strived to become even better.\nAfter featuring late off the bench against Italy in York, a first start in this year's Women's Six Nations came in the 67-12 hammering of Wales at Principality Stadium in front of a record crowd of 21,186 for a Wales women's team event on home soil.\nThe Harlequin marked her 50th cap with a second-half hat-trick and a player-of-the-match performance to properly kick-start the biggest year of her rugby career to date.\n\"Pressure is definitely a privilege,\" Kildunne told BBC Two.\n\"Our potential is the unimaginable. We are going to keep getting better. I really think we are going to take it to levels that we've not been to before.\n\"We are just going to keep pushing until we get to a point that we just can't imagine what is next.\"\nTwo of Kildunne's tries were relatively straightforward dot downs, with the third an instinctive finish from a kick-through.\nWhen the whistle sounded for the start of the second half, Kildunne had no tries. By  the 56th minute, her hand was above her head for yet another signature lasso celebration after a third score.\nKildunne made the most carries (16) and metres (145m) in the game, but it was her kicking game which stood out.\nFrom tidy deft chip-kicks to cause havoc in the backfield to grubber-kicks to turn the Wales defence, Kildunne has widened her game to be more than just a lethal counter-attack runner.\n\"She is starting to serve the team in different ways and there are going to be times that teams take away the counter-attack from her,\" England head coach John Mitchell told BBC Two.\n\"She is world-class with that plan A [running it back], but she is going to have to adapt in 2025 as certain teams will not allow her to get ball.\n\"We have to use her in the right way.\"\nKildunne made her England debut in 2018 as an 18-year-old\nWomen's Six Nations: Wales 7-26 England - bonus point secured in 27 minutes\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast\nKildunne was one of 13 changes Mitchell made to his starting XV from England's opening round victory over Italy, with the majority of his front-line starters returning.\nLike last weekend, the Red Roses ran away with the contest, scoring their bonus-point try inside 27 minutes.\nNumber eight Maddie Feaunati was named player of the match in York and further pressed her case to continue in the back row with two powerful finishes.\nWales-born Meg Jones scored the pick of England's 11 tries when she slalomed her way through her native country, showing incredible balance and footwork.\nJones, who was playing her first Red Roses match since both her parents passed away, pointed to the sky and tapped her chest before diving over the line.\n\"I haven't played here since I was 12 years old,\" Jones, 28, told BBC Two.\n\"When I heard both the anthems it took me a little bit. I have just tried to enjoy it as much as I can, I know they will both be so proud of me.\n\"I said in the week that they will still be in the crowd.

And it's just a really very special environment. And I wouldn't trade it for the world.\"\nIt was there that they teamed up with renowned coach Romain Haguenauer - and it was he who did not let on his real thoughts on what 30-year-old Gibson has described as a \"terrible\" first practice session together in Montreal.\n\"[There were] some little passive jokes perhaps but we always felt his belief and his encouragement for us to really want to try and go as far as we could,\" Gibson said previously.\n\"That has really instilled a hard work ethic in us and also where we want to get to in the sport, it just seems that the possibilities are endless, and I think that really came from him.\"\nHaguenauer is also the coach of Americans Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who won their third successive world title this year. \nMadison Chock and Evan Bates (centre) took gold, with Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier (left) getting silver ahead of Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson (right) with bronze\nThis video can not be played\nFear and Gibson's world figure skating championships performance\nA talented artist, who loves interior decorating, DIY and drawing, Gibson has also been able to channel creativity on to the ice \u2013 something that has been actively encouraged by Haguenauer.\nAccording to Fear, their coach will always say \"why not?\" to new ideas.\nLike Gibson, Fear is also highly creative, this year designing her own dress for their free dance.\nIn that context, it was no surprise that they bucked the trend and went for a fun disco-style free dance in 2018-19 while many of their rivals were skating to more serious classical numbers.\nThe crowds got on board with the 'Disco Brits' and their scores began to rise, winning the national championships and placing sixth at the Europeans that season.\n\nOver the years Fear and Gibson have been known for their high-energy performances that have delighted crowds because they always look like they are having fun with their best friend.\nThey really are.\nGibson has spoken in the past of his enjoyment of performing \u2013 be it dancing with his dad or posting light-hearted social videos.\nIt was that aspect of ice dance, coupled with a struggle to consistently perform the big jumps in single and pairs skating, that persuaded him to switch disciplines in 2015 at the age of 21.\nHe had been a late starter in figure skating, only taking it up at the age of 11, and even though he was a natural \u2013 he raced through three badges in one of his first beginner sessions \u2013 he was not qualifying for the biggest events in singles.\nIn their first season together in 2016-17, he and Fear won the British ice dance title and qualified for the European Championships. \nAway from the ice, Fear enjoys performing behind the microphone, either singing or presenting podcasts.\nA psychology student with a thirst for learning, she presents and edits her own podcasts where her interview subjects range from athletes to authors to entrepreneurs.\n\"I just really have felt the power of role models in my own life, [Canadian Olympic ice dance champion] Tessa Virtue really inspired me in this sport and the belief in myself,\" she said. \"And I want to be able to give that to people in a variety of crafts from all over the world to share stories and just spark something in my listeners.\"\nGibson has been a guest on her show, revealing his love of haggis and fudge and how he has the latitude and longitude coordinates of his home town - Prestwick in Scotland - tattooed on his shoulder. \n\nLilah Fear and Lewis Gibson create playlists over the year before settling on the music for next season's dances\nWhen it comes to their music choices for their dances, there are a couple of simple requirements.\n\"We go with the one that makes us the most excited and where we think, oh, yeah, we want to skate to that every single morning when it's freezing at 7am, and get all the repetitions and hear it over and over again,\" Fear said.\nThis season that means a Beyonce medley for the free dance, which includes Halo, which has allowed them to show a more emotional side before the trademark struts to Crazy in Love.\n\"It [Halo] really evokes something within us and we really believe in the message of finding your inner light, letting who you are shine through and just breaking down all those barriers that you've put up along the way,\" Fear said.\n\"That's where the emotion comes through is because it's a very authentic story for us and for everyone watching, they can relate to that feeling. And when you're able to perform from a place of truth like that, it's meaningful and can touch a lot more people.\"\nSuccess at the World Championships has come at the ideal time with next year's Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina looming large.\nSince finishing 10th in at the 2022 Beijing Games, Fear and Gibson have made no secret of their ambition to reach the podium in Italy for a first British Olympic figure skating medal since 1994.\nThat was a bronze for Torvill and Dean, 10 years after their famous gold, and the skating legends have often sent messages of encouragement to three-time European medallists Fear and Gibson over the years.\nTorvill and Dean have said they hope there is now a new couple who can take British ice dance forward after shouldering that job themselves for so many decades.\n\"Hopefully this will stir up momentum,\" Dean told BBC Sport last month.\n\"Success breeds success but you've got to have somebody doing that to begin with and hopefully that's what Lilah and Lewis can do for the future of British ice skating.\n\"We've been skating for together for 50 years and, you know, maybe they can see their future for another 50 years - that might shock them if they thought like that!\"",
