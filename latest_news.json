        "article_text": "This story contains details of someone taking their own life, which some readers may find distressing.\nThe family of a Boeing whistleblower who took his own life last year has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company.\nThe complaint alleges that John Barnett was subjected to a campaign of harassment, abuse and humiliation after he raised concerns about safety issues.\nIt claims that the conduct of the company was \"the clear, foreseeable cause\" of Mr Barnett's death.\nBoeing said it was saddened by Mr Barnett's death and extended its condolences to his family.\nThe former Boeing manager was found dead from what police described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the parking lot of a Charleston hotel on 9 March last year.\nThe 146-page lawsuit has been brought by his mother, Vicky Stokes, and his brothers Rodney and Michael on behalf of his estate. It was filed on Wednesday in the US District Court of South Carolina.\nIt attributes his death to Boeing's actions, including what it describes as a retaliatory campaign by his managers that amounted to a \"hostile work environment\".  \n\"Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that Boeing's conduct would result in PTSD and John's unbearable depression... Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death,\" it says.\nIt describes Mr Barnett as a dedicated, idealistic worker who \"took his role seriously in protecting the flying public\" and \"believed that he had a personal, legal and moral obligation to ensure\u2026 that every possible defect was identified, documented and remedied.\"\nIt describes how he was allegedly harassed, denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn and contempt, as well as being removed from investigations he was working on and blacklisted from transferring to other quality control positions within the company.\nMr Barnett took early retirement from Boeing in March 2017, at a time when the claim says he had been suffering from symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, and knew he was going to be fired. The lawsuit alleges the company continued to put pressure on him, for example by preventing friends who continued to work there from having any contact with him.\nAmong the exhibits put forward in support of the claim are an email, in which he says, \"Boeing has completely destroyed my outlook on life\" and his handwritten final note, which says \"I can't do this any longer!! Enough!!\"\nJohn Barnett worked for Boeing for 32 years. \nFrom 2010, he was employed as a quality manager at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility builds the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.\nDuring his time at the factory, Mr Barnett raised a number of concerns with management about violations of safety procedures, as well as about defects in aircraft on the production line.\nHe later took his concerns to the media. In 2019, he told the BBC that:\nBoeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns.\nIt established that the location of at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action.\nOn the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had \"identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly\". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft.\nSafety standards at Boeing have come under a harsh spotlight since an incident last year in which a disused door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max aircraft shortly after takeoff. \nThe incident, which came five years after two previous catastrophic accidents involving the 737 Max, brought intense scrutiny of the company's quality control procedures and conditions in the factory. \nThe company appointed a new chief executive last year, industry veteran Kelly Ortberg, and has produced a detailed action plan to address concerns raised by regulators about issues on the factory floor.\nIn response to the lawsuit being filed, Boeing issued a brief statement. \n\"We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family,\" it said.\nPreviously, however, the company has pushed back against the allegations made against it, telling the BBC: \"Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety.\"\nIt also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law.\nIt added: \"We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously.\"\nIf you have been affected by the issues in this story, you can find support from the BBC's Action Line.",

        "article_text": "When you see pasta, your brain probably doesn't jump to the secrets of the universe. But for almost a century, physicists have puzzled over spaghetti's counterintuitive properties.\nYou might think physicists only ask the big questions. We mostly hear about the physics of the cosmic and the miniscule, the shape of our universe and the nature of the particles that fill it. But physicists, of course, have ordinary lives outside of the laboratory, and sometimes their way of questioning the universe spills over to their daily habits. There's one everyday item that seems to especially obsess them: spaghetti.\nGoing back at least a century, spaghetti has been the subject of rigorous studies. Through this research, physicists continue to learn new things about the solid state of matter, the chemistry of food and even draw connections to the origin of life. The steady torrent of spaghetti science helps to demonstrate that deep questions lurk in our ordinary routines, and that there are plenty of hungry physicists who can't stop asking them.\nFor example: how thin can spaghetti get? The typical spaghetto \u2013 the word for an individual strand of spaghetti \u2013 is between one and two mm thick (0.04-0.08in). But other long noodles vary widely in diameter, from udon at 4mm (0.16in) to angel hair at 0.8mm (0.03in). The thinnest handmade strands are called su filindeu, coming in at 0.4mm (0.02in), so slender that only a few women in Nuoro, Italy know how to make them.\nBut recently, a team of researchers at the University College London wondered if 21st Century lab equipment could do better. They used a technique called \"electro-spinning\". First, they dissolved flour into a special, electrically charged solution in a syringe. Then they held the syringe over a special, negatively-charged plate. \"This pulls the solution through the dispenser needle down towards the collector plate in a very stringy noodle-type shape,\" says Beatrice Britton, lead author of the study.\nWhen the solution dried, the researchers were left with a crisscrossing thread of incredibly thin spaghetti. \"To the naked eye, all you see is a sort of lasagna sheet,\" Britton says, but a powerful microscope reveals a mat made of strands as thin as 0.1mm (0.004in). These noodles are also much stiffer than regular spaghetti. Britton and her colleagues hope their research can be a step towards biodegradable alternatives to plastic \"nanofibres\", which are now used to filter liquids and treat wounds.\nThe world's thinnest spaghetti is just one recent example of how physicists can't seem to stop plying their tools on everybody's favourite carb. But physicists using their noodle on their noodles is no new thing. In 1949, Brown University physicist George F Carrier posed \"the spaghetti problem\" in The American Mathematical Monthly, which he deemed to be \"of considerable popular and academic interest\". Essentially, the problem amounts to: \"Why can't I slurp up a strand of spaghetti without getting sauce on my face\"?\nHis equations showed how the exposed strand swings about more wildly as it gets shorter and shorter, guaranteeing an eventual slap of the noodle against the slurper's lip \u2013 and the fateful sauce eruption Carrier so deplored. Sadly, his mathematical formulas offered no way around the face-slap. It's as deeply etched in the laws of the universe as the Big Bang.\nLater, two scientists inverted Carrier's pioneering study, exploring what happens when a stringy object slips out of a hole instead of being sucked in. They called their version the \"reverse spaghetti problem\", familiar to any impatient eater who's had to spit out burning pasta because they hadn't waited for it to cool. For now, no theoretical physicist has attempted the more complicated problem of two dogs slurping from either end of the same spaghetti strand.\u00a0\nThe great mid-century American physicist Richard Feynman helped unlock the riddles of quantum mechanics, explaining how the elementary particles that make up atoms interact with one another. But Feynman's enormous contribution to spaghetti physics is less widely known. One night, Feynman wondered why it's almost impossible to break a stick of spaghetti into two pieces instead of three. He and a colleague spent the rest of the evening snapping spaghetti sticks until they covered the kitchen floor.\nFeynman's interrogation into the counterintuitive physics of dry spaghetti sparked a quarter century of attempts to explain it. This finally happened in 2005, when two French researchers showed that spaghetti always breaks into two pieces \u2013 at first. But after the fracture, as the two bent pieces snap straight again, all their pent-up strain gets released in a shockwave, causing further splintering.\nIn 2018, a team of MIT scientists figured out how to stifle the shockwave \u2013 delicately twist the spaghetti strand before snapping it. Their method required lab equipment, but it reliably produced a perfect pair of fragments. Their work provided a new and deeper understanding of brittle rods that goes beyond spaghetti; the phenomenon of three-way fracturing is well-known to pole vaulters, for example.\nMy (Italian-American) mother taught me to break a bundle of dry spaghetti in half before putting it in boiling water, so it fits horizontally in the pot. I guess Feynman did the same, but it's an outrage to many of the world's spaghetti-eaters. If you're in the latter camp, then you place your dried spaghetti bundle upright in the pot of boiling water, then watch it slowly soften, buckle and submerge itself.\nThis familiar spaghetti behaviour may not seem like a puzzle, but try removing a recently-curled piece of spaghetti from the pot and letting it dry. It will stay curved rather than returning to its original straight length \u2013 something in those first few minutes irreversibly changes the composition of the spaghetti. In 2020, two physicists finally explained this spaghetti transmutation. It's due to a feature called \"viscoelasticity\" \u2013 a name for the unique way materials like spaghetti respond to physical stress. This special property allows water to flow through the strand's outer layers.\nThe strange mechanics of cooked spaghetti go even further. In one study, scientists dropped strands on the ground and measured how they coiled to learn about other elastic materials, from rope to DNA strands. In another, physicists tied spaghetti into knots and studied what types of strain would cause them to tear.\nSpaghetti physics even goes beyond the pasta itself \u2013 sauce is loaded with its own scientific mysteries. When eight Italian physicists met while doing research abroad in Germany, they found a shared frustration in the classic Roman dish cacio e pepe.\nThe sauce requires very few ingredients \u2013 it's basically a mixture of reserved pasta water and grated pecorino cheese \u2013 but they'd all experienced its mystifying fickleness. Often the cheese irreversibly clumps up, ruining the sauce. This is especially common when you cook it in large batches, which made the physicists hesitant to invite their German colleagues to dinner. \"We can't mess up cacio e pepe in front of German people,\" says Ivan Di Terlizzi, who studies statistical and biological physics at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, Germany.\nFortunately, among them were some of the world's foremost experts on the physics of \"phase separation\", exactly the kind of congealing phenomenon that plagued their group dinners. Arguing about the phase separation of cacio e pepe, they realised it was flummoxing from a scientific perspective as well.\n\"This is actually a very interesting problem,\" says Daniel Maria Busiello, co-author on the cacio\u00a0study. \"So we decided to design an experimental apparatus to actually test all these things.\"\nThe \"apparatus\" consisted of a bath of water heated to a low temperature, a kitchen thermometer, a petri dish and an iPhone camera attached to an empty box. They invited as many hungry friends as they could find to Di Terlizzi's apartment and hunkered down to cook a weekend's worth of cacio e pepe.\u00a0\nThey found that the \"simple\" sauce was enormously complex. Chemically, it's a water-based solution with only a few components: starch (from the pasta water), lipids (from the cheese) and two kinds of protein (also from the cheese). Using their apparatus, they found a physical explanation for the sauce-wrecking clumps, which they termed the \"mozzarella phase\".\nProteins, unlike most molecules, get stickier when they're hot. As the sauce is heated, the researchers found this leads to these proteins sticking to the lipids and forming mozzarella-like clumps. In a well-made cacio e pepe, what prevents this is the starch, which forms a protective coat around the lipid molecules so they can't stick to the proteins. If the sauce gets too hot, the increased stickiness of the proteins overcomes this barrier.\nOnce they understood the science behind the sauce, it was clear how to fix it. \"If you add enough starch above a certain threshold, you don't get this kind of separated state,\" says Di Terlizzi. Pasta water doesn't typically contain enough starch to guarantee this threshold, so they suggest adding a mixture of corn starch dissolved in water.\nThe group decided to conclude their manuscript with a foolproof recipe for the classic dish. But in surveying the rich scientific literature, they realised they weren't the first to reach this cacio epiphany. In the name of academic integrity, they cited a YouTube video wherein the Michelin-star Roman chef Luciano Monosilio suggests the same tweak for a foolproof recipe \u2013 a dash of corn starch. \"It's the only non-scientific reference in our paper,\" says Di Terlizzi.\nThe physics they used connects the clumping of cacio e pepe to ideas about the origin of life on Earth. Biophysicists use phase separation to understand how droplets of liquid can congeal and divide within a solution. \"A droplet dividing pretty much looks like a proto-cell,\" says Giacomo Bartolucci, another co-author on the study. Inside the little blobs that preceded actual cells, some believe, the building blocks of life may have come together via a process much like the Italians\u2019 mozzarella phase. The same ideas are helping biologists understand how the plaques that cause Alzheimer's coalesce in the brain.\nWhy is spaghetti such a locus of speculation and study for physicists?\nFor one, it's simple \u2013 flour, water and heat, says Vishal Patil, one of the discoverers of the twist-and-break method who is now a professor of mathematics at the University of California, San Diego. The fact that a combination of so few components raises so many deep questions speaks to how physics underlies everything they see and do, Patil says.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 Why sarcastic teens are the smartest\n\u2022 The French towns giving away free chickens\n\u2022 YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know\nIt also shows that no matter how deep physicists probe the big and the small, the answers can still fall short of explaining phenomena we see every day. When it comes to cacio e pepe, all the tools of theoretical physics can only tell us what every Italian grandmother knows: keep the stove burning low when you make it. Laboratory electrospinning can only achieve marginally thinner spaghetti than what the women of Nuoro, Italy make daily by hand.\n\"Spaghetti is just a very accessible thing you can play with,\" Patil says. The low cost of flour-based noodles is what made them a democratic delicacy for so many cultures around the world \u2013 spaghetti was popularised in Naples as street food. That's why Feynman didn't hesitate to snap pounds of the stuff onto his kitchen floor.\nAfter a long day at the blackboard, plugging away at the impenetrable math of quantum mechanics or black holes, the mechanical wonders of spaghetti are the perfect fodder for scientists' mealtime probing.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "The 2025 season began in thrilling fashion as Lando Norris beat Max Verstappen to win an incident-packed Australian Grand Prix.\nMeanwhile, Lewis Hamilton finished 10th in his first race for Ferrari.\nChangeable conditions led to a series of crashes, three safety cars and an aborted start.\nBBC Sport F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your questions after the race in Melbourne.\nWill McLaren allow Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri to race? They always say the drivers are free to race, however whenever they get near on track, drivers are told to hold positions. Will this rob us of the only championship battle if the McLaren is so dominant? - Martin\nThere's a simple answer to this question - yes. McLaren's philosophy is that the drivers are free to race, with the caveat that the team's interests always come first.\nWhat that means is that the drivers have rules - Norris and Piastri can compete but they cannot risk each other's cars.\nThat's what explains the order, midway through the Australian Grand Prix, for the cars to hold station until they had cleared some lapped traffic and the team had a better understanding of the incoming wet weather.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said: \"During the race at some stage we had to go relatively soon through some backmarkers while the cars were close together and the conditions on track were still a little tricky with intermediate tyres that were running down a bit in terms of their rubber, and at the same time receiving some updates on the weather forecast.\n\"That led us to close, for a short period, the internal racing until we had clarity as to the weather prediction, what this meant for how we should use the tyres, and until we had closed the matter of overtaking the backmarkers. Once this was completed, we re-opened the racing.\"\nIt was clear from the tone of Piastri's reply that he was not that happy about being told to hold station - at that stage he had closed to within a second of Norris and was challenging for the lead, claiming he was quicker.\nOnce the drivers were allowed to race again, though, Norris extended the gap, and then Piastri made a mistake at Turn Six trying to keep up.\nThat suggests Norris had previously been managing his pace to contain the wear on his intermediates. And Piastri admitted his tyres were too far gone by then to challenge.\nThe overall philosophy was explained by Norris after qualifying.\n\"There are clearly rules we cannot cross,\" he said. \"Both cars must always stay in the race, but we're both competitors. That's clear.\n\"We both want to fight for a win and victories. But there are boundaries around the car - just a little more space here and there. We're free to race, free to try and win races.\n\"But what won us the constructors' last year was how we helped one another and how we kept things clean.\" \nHow long do you predict it will take Lewis Hamilton to find his feet at Ferrari, as in to at least match Charles Leclerc, if he does? - Oliver\nSince Hamilton joined Ferrari, he has consistently referred to the learning process he will have to go through before he can perform at his optimum.\nOver the race weekend in Australia, the word that kept recurring was \"building\" - a reference to the accumulation of knowledge he requires before he can extract the best from himself within the context of Ferrari's car and team.\nThis involves the behaviour of the car on track, the operations of the car's systems - two things that are interlinked - and his communications with the team, both in the car and out of it.\nThrough the weekend in Melbourne, there were obvious signs that these were not  yet at their most fluent.\nHamilton said: \"I've learned a huge amount this weekend. There's a lot to take away from it. And, yeah, I've got some changes I've got to make for next week, and I'll see how it goes.\"\nHow long will this process take? Well, as the saying goes, how long is a piece of string?\nThe question contains an assumption, though. Hamilton will certainly believe he can \"at least match Charles Leclerc\". In fact, he'll believe he can beat him on balance over a season. Of course he will.\nBut Leclerc is richly talented, and possibly the fastest driver over one lap in F1.\nGood as Hamilton obviously is, this is no easy challenge.\n\n'Copybook victory as Norris and McLaren come through chaos unscathed'\nHamilton's first Ferrari race 'a big crash course'\n'I'm just embarrassed' - tough introduction for F1 rookies\nWhat's wrong with the second Red Bull seat? No-one has performed well in it for a while now. It's like it's cursed - Niko\nMax Verstappen is a genius-level driver who is clearly an all-time great. Anyone who got into the second Red Bull would know they faced the fight of their lives to come out on top against the Dutchman - and that includes the other recognised top-level drivers in F1 at the moment.\nAnd within that reality lies the inherent contradiction of the approach Red Bull are taking to their second seat.\nThey don't want a driver who can challenge Verstappen. They want someone who can provide enough support to get in the mix with his rivals and take points off them, easing Verstappen's path to the drivers' title and the team's to the constructors' championship.\nThe problem is that they keep picking second-string drivers to do a job that only drivers of a higher quality are able to do.\nIn a tightly-packed field, having a driver who is at best 0.3 seconds a lap off Verstappen is going to mean someone qualifies close to the back of the group of the top four teams, and therefore is rarely going to be of much help.\nFor this season, they could have had Carlos Sainz - a driver who actually very marginally out-qualified Verstappen when they were team-mates at Toro Rosso back in 2015.\nBut they rejected him on the basis of the potential tension it would cause in their team. Instead, they picked Sergio Perez - a decision that baffled many people in F1.\nIt backfired on them when the Mexican had a second poor season, and they had to pay him off. Now they have picked Liam Lawson, a rookie with only 11 races' experience and of as-yet-unproven quality.\nThrown in at the deep end in Melbourne, Lawson struggled, to say the least.\nThe situation is exacerbated because the car is developed following Verstappen's feedback.\nHe wants a very sharp front end, and has the ability to cope with the loose rear this inevitably creates. But only drivers of the very highest level of talent could cope with those characteristics, and only drivers with the very highest level of mental strength could cope with racing Verstappen.\nLewis Hamilton fought for the title in his rookie season. Is that still possible for the right driver in the right car or have times, processes and cars moved on since then? - Doug\nThere is no question that moving to a new team presents a driver with a series of challenges that make his life more difficult - as explained above.\nHamilton, of course, famously fought for the title in his debut season with McLaren in 2007, but that was after meticulous preparation and thousands of kilometres of testing, which made him what is widely regarded as the best prepared rookie in history.\nIt's been a while since a driver has immediately contended for the championship after switching teams, but then all the title battles in recent years have been between teams whose drivers have been with them for some time.\nThe last time a driver new to a team fought for the title was 2010, when Fernando Alonso not only won his first race for Ferrari, but took the title battle to the wire. Had it not been for an infamously catastrophic strategy error at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, he would have been champion.\nJenson Button was also on the fringes of the title fight that season, after moving from Brawn to McLaren.\nIt's hard to form conclusions from that, though, because it's so long ago. F1 cars have become significantly more complex since then, and drivers have less time in terms of pre-season testing to prepare.\nHaving said that, perhaps one should consider another year of Alonso's career.\nIn 2023, he joined Aston Martin from Alpine, and he was outstanding from the start. He was Verstappen's biggest challenger for the first part of the season, took six podiums in the first eight races, came close to winning in Monaco, and was outstanding all year, even as the team fell from competitiveness.\nSo, it's hard to argue against the idea that if a driver is good enough - and Hamilton obviously is - it is possible.\n\nThis video can not be played\nBig surprises & how will Hamilton do?: BBC 5Live team share 2025 predictions\nAston Martin have invested a lot of money in people, facilities and resources. Does money guarantee success in F1? - Anil\nMoney is required to succeed in F1, but it does not guarantee success.\nThe example always held up on this subject is Toyota's F1 programme, which ran from 2002-9.\nIt is widely regarded to have had the biggest budget ever, but the team failed to win a single race.\nThere were a bunch of reasons for this - and never having a true top-level driver was certainly one of them.\nBut most would agree the fundamental issue was that corporate Toyota was too involved in the team, with too many layers and strictures of management, depriving it of the dexterity and fleet-footedness required of any F1 team operating at the highest level.\nAt its heart, F1 success is about finding the right people, putting them in the right places, and empowering them to produce the best of themselves. An approach perfectly demonstrated by McLaren's rise from backmarkers to world champions in the last couple of years.\nAs Alonso said in Australia, Aston Martin now have all that is required for success.\nThey have a state-of-the-art new factory - including a driver-in-the-loop simulator, and a wind tunnel that has just become operational - and have signed Adrian Newey, the sport's greatest ever designer, to lead an expensively assembled technical team.\nBut now they have to put all that together and prove they can compete with teams that have been at the front for years.\n\"The package is completed now,\" Alonso said. \"We will need time. This is not football. Football is very easy - you take the best pitch, the best manager, the best players and eventually you win maybe the next match.\n\"In F1, you can have the best facilities, the best people, but you still need time to put the ingredients together and win, and we have so many examples in F1 history.\"\nSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson\nAustralian Grand Prix in pictures\nAustralian Grand Prix Review\nHow to follow Chinese Grand Prix on the BBC",

        "article_text": "Colombian energy giant Ecopetrol has polluted hundreds of sites with oil, including water sources and biodiverse wetlands, the BBC World Service has found.\nData leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.\nThe BBC has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times since then.\nEcopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.\nThe company's main refinery is in Barrancabermeja, 260km (162 miles) north of the Colombian capital Bogota.\nThe huge cluster of processing plants, industrial chimneys and storage tanks stretches for close to 2km (1.2 miles) along the banks of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena \u2013 a water source for millions of people.\nMembers of the fishing community there believe oil pollution is affecting wildlife in the river.\nThe wider area is home to endangered river turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, and is part of a species-rich hotspot in one of the world's most biodiverse countries. Nearby wetlands include a protected habitat for jaguars.\nWhen the BBC visited last June, families were fishing together in waterways criss-crossed by oil pipelines.\nOne local said some of the fish they caught released the pungent smell of crude oil as they were cooked.\nIn places, a film with iridescent swirls could be seen on the surface of the water - a distinctive signature of contamination by oil.\nA fisherman dived down in the water and brought up a clump of vegetation caked in dark slime.\nPointing to it, Yuly Vel\u00e1squez, president of Fedepesan, a federation of fishing organisations in the region, said: \"This is all grease and waste that comes directly from the Ecopetrol refinery.\"\nEcopetrol, which is 88% owned by the Colombian state and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rejects the fishers' claims that it is polluting the water.\nIn response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.\nAndr\u00e9s Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.\nHe joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised \"something was wrong\".\nMr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as \"awful\" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: \"Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.\"\nHe left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.\nOne database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called \"unresolved environmental impacts\" across Colombia.\nEcopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.\nMr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled \"only known to Ecopetrol\".\n\"You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,\" says Mr Olarte.\nThe BBC filmed at one of the sites marked \"only known to Ecopetrol\", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.\nEcopetrol's CEO from 2017 to 2023, Felipe Bay\u00f3n, told the BBC he strongly denied suggestions that there was any policy to withhold information about pollution.\n\"I say to you with complete confidence that there is not, and was not any policy nor any instruction saying, 'these things can't be shared',\" he said.\nMr Bay\u00f3n blamed sabotage for many oil spills.\nColombia has a long history of armed conflict, and illegal armed groups have targeted oil facilities - but \"theft\" or \"attack\" are only mentioned for 6% of the cases listed in the database.\nHe also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.\nHowever, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.\nFigures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.\nAsked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".\nThe firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.\nIt says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.\nThe data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.\nThe fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.\nShe said there had been a \"massacre\" of fauna. \"This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,\" she said last June.\nIt is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.\nA 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.\nMr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.\n\"In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,\" he says.\nMr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC.

The military should only manage barracks and national defence,\" said Wilson, an activist with the Indonesian Association of Families of the Disappeared (KontraS), a group advocating for activists who disappeared during a crackdown in 1997 and 1998.\n\"Since 1998, there has been a creeping murder of democracy. And today marks its peak. Democracy has been killed by the House of Representatives,\" Wilson told the BBC. \nThe revisions allow active military personnel to hold positions in 14 civilian institutions, up from 10. They also raise retirement age by several years for most ranks. Highest-ranking four-star generals can now serve until 63, up from 60. \nBy Thursday evening, the crowd of protesters outside parliament had grown to nearly a thousand. \"Return the military to the barracks!\" \"Against militarism and oligarchy,\" read the banners they held.\nPolice officers and military personnel stood guard around the protesters. \nWhile there have been efforts over the past 25 years to limit the military's involvement in politics and governance, local human rights watchdog Imparsial found that nearly 2,600 active-duty officers were serving in civilian roles even before the law's revision.\nThe changes signal a \"broader consolidation of power\" under Prabowo, said Dedi Dinarto, lead Indonesia analyst at public policy advisory firm Global Counsel. \nThat the main opposition party endorsed the changes - despite initial opposition - further underscores this shift, he noted. \n\"By embedding military perspectives into civilian domains, the legislation could reshape Indonesia's policy direction, potentially prioritising stability and state control over democratic governance and civil liberties,\" Mr Dinarto said. \nThe armed forces' \"dual function\", where they are given control of security and administrative affairs, was central to Suharto's regime.\nFor some Indonesians, Prabowo epitomises that authoritarian era. It was he who led the special forces unit accused of abducting activists in 1997 and 1998.\nMany had feared that his return to political power and becoming president would erode Indonesia's hard-won but fragile democracy.\nSince taking office last October, Prabowo has already been expanding the military's involvement in public areas. His flagship $4bn free-meal programme for children and pregnant women, for instance, receives logistical support from the armed forces.\nDefending the amendments on Thursday, defence minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin told parliament \"geopolitical changes and global military technology\" require the military to transform to tackle \"conventional and non conventional conflicts\". \n\"We will never disappoint the Indonesians in keeping our sovereignty,\" he said. \nHowever some rights groups argue that increasing military control in public affairs beyond defence will undermine impartiality. \n\"How can active-duty officers in the Attorney General's Office remain impartial when they are still bound by military command?\" asked Virdika Rizky Utama, a researcher at Jakarta-based think-tank PARA Syndicate, Benar News reports. \n\"If the military gains influence over the justice system, who will hold them accountable?\" \n\"President Prabowo appears intent on restoring the Indonesian military's role in civilian affairs, which were long characterised by widespread abuses and impunity,\" said Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch. \n\"The government's rush to adopt these amendments undercuts its expressed commitment to human rights and accountability.\" \nKontraS also noted that the government's \"rush to amend the [law] stands in stark contrast to its prolonged inaction on other critical human rights commitments\".\n\"This long struggle cannot stop just because the law has been passed. There is only one word: Resist,\" said Sukma Ayu, an undergraduate at Universitas Muhammadiyah Prof. Hamka in Jakarta. \n\"We will continue protesting until we claim victory... We have no choice but to occupy the 'house of the people',\" she said. ",

The argued in part that because Boasberg's order was made orally rather than in written form, it was not enforceable - and that the planes had already left the US by the time it was issued.\nBoasberg has ordered the administration to give further details about the deportations by noon (16:00 GMT) on Tuesday.\nHe has requested further details about the timing of the order under which the deportations occurred, as well as details about the flights themselves.\nDuring a hearing on Monday, Boasberg said he clearly ordered the government to turn the planes around.\n\"You're saying that you felt you could disregard it because it wasn't in a written order?\" he asked Department of Justice lawyers.\nIn the same hearing on Monday, the judge said he would not make another ruling in the case until a hearing scheduled for Friday. \nIn the meantime, government lawyers said that the deportations had been paused. The Trump administration also asked in a court motion that Boasberg be removed from the case.\nThe dispute began over the weekend when a group of 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members, plus 23 alleged members of the international MS-13 gang, were sent from the US to a prison in El Salvador.\nAnnouncing the move on Saturday, Trump accused the gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\".\nHe cited the Alien Enemies Act - legislation dating to 1798 that allows non-citizens to be deported in wartime. The act was last used during World War Two, when it was invoked to arrest and deport citizens of Axis countries.\nCampaign groups have questioned Trump's justification.\nThe act was used as the basis to deport 137 of the total of 261 people who were deported, the White House said on Monday. The basis on which the other deportees were removed from the US is unclear.\nOn Saturday, during the hearing that took place as several of the deportation flights were in the air, Boasberg ordered a 14-day pause.\nAfter lawyers told the judge that planes with deportees already had taken off, he reportedly gave a verbal order for the flights to turn back \"immediately\", although that directive was not included in a written ruling published shortly thereafter.\nNonetheless, a timeline of events reported by US media suggests the Trump administration had the opportunity to stop at least some of the deportations.\nUnder the US system of checks and balances, government agencies are expected to comply with a federal judge's ruling.\nBut Trump's Department of Justice argued, citing case law in a filing on Monday, that \"an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction\".\nAdministration officials also pointed out that the five named plaintiffs in the lawsuit that prompted the hearing were not among those deported, and also argued that once the flights left US airspace, the judge's powers no longer applied.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order.\"\nNeither the US government nor El Salvador has named those who have been deported, or provided details of their alleged criminality or gang membership.\nSeveral relatives of men believed to be among the group told the New York Times that their loved ones did not have gang ties.\nThe White House, for its part, has insisted that authorities are \"sure\" that the detainees were gang members, based on intelligence.\nTrump's border tsar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House on Monday that Trump did \"exactly the right thing\".\n\"The plane was already over international waters with a plane full of terrorists and significant public safety threats,\" he said. \n\"We removed terrorists. That should be celebrated in this country.\"\nEl Salvador has agreed to accept the deportees from the US.\nThe country's president, Nayib Bukele, appeared to mock the judge's ruling.\n\"Oopsie\u2026 Too late,\" he posted on social media, along with a picture of a headline announcing the ruling and a 'crying with laughter' emoji.\nHis team also published footage of some of the detainees inside one of its mega-jails.\nAccording to the White House, El Salvador's government received $6m (\u00a34.62m) to take the detainees, which Leavitt said \"is pennies on the dollar\" compared to the cost of holding inmates in US prisons.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which brought the lawsuit leading to the judge's order, questioned Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act, a sweeping wartime authority that allows fast-track deportations.\n\"I think we're in very dangerous territory here in the United States with the invocation of this law,\" said the ACLU's Lee Gelernt.\nThe Alien Enemies Act only allowed deportations when the US was in a declared war with that foreign government, or was being invaded, Mr Gelernt said. \n\"A gang is not invading,\" he told BBC News.\nMaking matters worse was the fact \"the administration is saying nobody can review what they're doing\", Mr Gelernt added.\nAmnesty International USA said the deportations were \"yet another example of the Trump administration's racist targeting\" of Venezuelans \"based on sweeping claims of gang affiliation\".\nVenezuela itself criticised Trump, saying he \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\".\nThe latest deportations under Trump's second term are part of the president's long-running campaign against illegal immigration.\nThe two gangs targeted with the weekend deportations were declared \"foreign terrorist organisations\" by Trump after returning to the White House in January.",

        "article_text": "The government has unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the overhaul would create a more \"pro-work system\" to encourage people to take up jobs, while protecting those who cannot work.\nThe changes will make it harder for people with less severe conditions to claim disability payments. Extra benefit payments for health conditions will also be frozen for current claimants and nearly halved for new applicants. \nAnd people aged under 22 could be prevented from claiming universal credit top-up payments for health conditions.\nThe government has not given a precise breakdown of the forecast savings but the bulk are expected to come from changes to eligibility for disability payments. \nThe overall benefits bill will continue to rise - but Kendall told the BBC the changes would put welfare on a more \"sustainable footing\" by getting people into work.\nSpending on health and disability-related benefits has ballooned since the Covid pandemic, and has been forecast to increase from \u00a365bn a year currently to \u00a3100bn by 2029.\nThe proposals are the result of months of work but they have become more urgent with the worsening economic backdrop, which has made it more difficult for the government to meet its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.\nCharities and some Labour MPs are worried benefit cuts will push disabled people into poverty. \nThe government responded to their concerns by scrapping plans to freeze personal independence payments (Pips), which provide extra living costs for people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition.\nBut Kendall said eligibility for Pips - the main disability benefit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - would be tightened from November 2026. \nIt will become harder to qualify for the daily living component of Pip, which is for people who need help with everyday tasks and starts at \u00a372.65 a week. \nThere will be no change to the mobility component, for those who need help getting around.\nKendall told the BBC details on how many people would be affected would be set out alongside Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring Statement next week. \nThe Resolution Foundation think tank has estimated between 800,000 and 1.2 million people could lose support because of restrictions on claiming Pip.\nKendall also announced work capability assessments, which are used to determine whether someone is fit to work and if they can receive additional benefits payments because of a health condition or disability, would be scrapped in 2028.\nShe said the assessments were \"complex, time-consuming and often stressful for claimants\", as well as being based \"on a binary can-can't work divide\".\nIn the future, financial support for health conditions will only be available through the Pip assessment, based on the impact of someone's health condition rather than their capacity to work. \nReassessments to determine whether someone is still eligible for benefits will increase, although those with the most severe conditions that will never improve will not be reassessed. \nFrom April next year the extra amount of universal credit for a health condition or disability will be frozen for existing claimants until 2029/30 and cut by almost half for new claimants.\nThere will be an additional premium for people with severe, lifelong conditions that mean they will never work.\nMeanwhile, there will be a permanent, above-inflation rise to the standard allowance of universal credit \u2013 equivalent to a \u00a3775 annual increase in cash terms by 2029/30.\nThe government will also introduce a \"right to try\" to guarantee that people who try out a job will not lose their existing benefits if it does not work out.\nThe Disability Benefits Consortium, which represents more than 100 charities and organisations, said: \"These immoral and devastating benefits cuts will push more disabled people into poverty, and worsen people's health.\"\nThe SNP said the measures would \"harm the most vulnerable\" and \"mark the start of a new era of austerity cuts\".\nDebbie Abrahams, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, argued there were \"more compassionate ways to balance the books rather than on the back of sick and disabled people\".\nHowever, other Labour MPs agree with the government that there is a moral case for reforming the welfare system to encourage people into work.\nThe Conservatives said the changes were \"too little, too late\" and needed to be \"tougher\".\nShadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately asked why the government was only planning to save \u00a35bn annually, when the total bill for health and disability benefits is forecast to rise to more than \u00a3100bn a year by 2029/30.\nLiberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said: \"If the government was serious about cutting welfare spending it would get serious about fixing health and social care and the broken Department of Work and Pensions.\"\nSome of the changes will require new legislation, raising the prospect of a rebellion by some Labour MPs during votes in Parliament.\nHowever, the size of the government's majority limits the threat from a vote. \nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

When asked by the judge whether he had read the 12-page indictment, he reportedly responded, \"Not cover to cover\".\nHe was released on a $100,000 bail, and he is expected to attend trial in New York at a later date. If found guilty, he faces 20 years in prison.",

Netflix has declined to comment on his arrest.Between 2018 to 2019, the streaming giant gave Mr Rinsch an initial budget of $44m to film the show, which depicts artificial human clones, but he allegedly never completed a single episode.In March 2020, Netflix sent him another $11m after he argued that the initial budget was \"not sufficient\", according to prosecutors.But instead of using the funds for the series, he allegedly transferred them to his personal bank accounts and used it to invest in several risky financial ventures, the US Justice Department said. \"Only two months after receiving the $11m, about half of it had already been spent, the indictment says.While he \"was in the process of losing\" the money, Mr Rinsch allegedly informed Netflix that the show was \"awesome and moving forward really well\", according to the indictment.He allegedly used the remaining funds to speculate on cryptocurrency, and on personal expenses and luxury items for himself, including a fleet of Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari, court documents state. If found guilty, he faces 20 years in prison.FilmNetflixHollywood \"But that was fiction.",

The feeling persists that the American icon is not yet ready for retirement.\nA wildcard for Indian Wells was announced but then swiftly declined. A \"miscommunication\" was the reason given.\nSources say Williams was then offered a wildcard for the Miami Open, which began on Tuesday and was the venue of her last match.\nThe 44-year-old thought about it for a couple of days - although it was no great surprise when she turned it down.\nHowever, the Florida resident did take to the practice court there on Wednesday for a session with Tunisia's Ons Jabeur.\nIndian Wells and Miami were the only two tournaments Williams played last year. \nHer last Grand Slam appearance was at the 2023 US Open and her last victory at any level came against Veronika Kudermetova in Cincinnati two weeks before that.\nThe last time Williams played a full schedule was 2019. \nIt was some achievement to do so in the year she turned 39, having been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, external - an autoimmune condition which can cause fatigue and joint pain - a few years earlier.\nBut turning 45 - which she will do just two weeks before Wimbledon on 17 June - is historically not a barrier to competing on tour. After all, Martina Navratilova won a singles match at the All England Club aged 47. \nShould Williams request a wildcard for either Wimbledon, where she is a five-time singles champion, or for the US Open, where she won the singles title twice, it seems unlikely it would be rejected.\nFashion is a big part of Williams' life and she was at Paris Fashion Week two weeks ago - one of the reasons she did not play in Indian Wells.\nShe owns the interior design company V Starr but, even though more than 30 years have passed since her professional debut, many feel she will attempt a final foray into professional tennis.\nSecond Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefing\n'Sport was a big release' - how autism helps Brooksby on court\nGetting through groundhog day - how Draper became Masters champion\nIt is possible Williams, who is ranked number 1,151, will never retire. \nFormer US Open and French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova has not played since Wimbledon 2021, but is yet formally to call it a day. \nVenus' sister Serena, meanwhile, did not like the word retirement, preferring instead  to \"evolve away from the sport\" in September 2022.\nSerena's name does, however, appear on the International Tennis Integrity Agency's retired players list. \nJoining that list is a strong commitment to retiring, as any player who later changes their mind must make themselves available for drug testing for six months before returning to play.\nIt means Venus could still expect a visit from out-of-competition testers. But she no longer needs to submit details of her daily whereabouts as she was removed from the international registered testing pool last June - a usual process for singles players who drop out of the world's top 100.\nWilliams has not played frequently enough to qualify as either a full or associate member of the WTA Tour this year, but she has also not completed a WTA retirement form. \nTo play again she would need to fill out an annual player form and find a $250 administration fee from the nearly $43m of prize money she has earned. \nHer management team did not respond to a request for information about her plans and it seems Williams will keep us guessing a little longer. Any ideas she might have for the summer have not been widely shared within the sport.\nMany retirement tributes have been written and signed off a long time ago.\nThey may still need updating.",

That vote is set for Friday.\nFriedrich Merz, the man behind these plans and who is expected to soon be confirmed as Germany's new chancellor, told the lower house during Tuesday's debate that the country had \"felt a false sense of security\" for the past decade.\n\"The decision we are taking today... can be nothing less than the first major step towards a new European defence community,\" he said, adding that it includes countries that are \"not members of the European Union\".\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the vote \"excellent news\".\nSpeaking at a press conference with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, she said the vote \"sends a very clear message to Europe that Germany is determined to invest massively in defence\".\nFrederiksen meanwhile called it \"fantastic news for all Europeans\".\nGermany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.\nBut despite fears the vote would be tight, lawmakers in the end voted in favour of the changes by 513 to 207 - comfortably over the two-thirds majority required.\nOne leading German newspaper described this vote as \"A day of destiny for our nation\".\nUnder the measure, any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. Until now, this debt brake has been fixed at 0.35% of GDP.\nThe change could transform the country's partially neglected armed forces in an era of great uncertainty for Europe.\nAnd this vote was not just about defence. It was also about freeing up \u20ac500bn for German infrastructure - fixing things like bridges and roads, but also to pay for climate change measures, something the Green Party insisted on.\nMerz, whose CDU party won Germany's general election last month, proposed the measures swiftly after the win.\nIn an interview on Sunday he specifically mentioned fears that the US could pull back from defending Europe and Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that the \"situation has worsened in recent weeks\".\n\"That is why we have to act fast,\" Merz told public broadcaster ARD.\nIt is a significant political win for Merz, who will, when he takes power as chancellor, now have access to hundreds of billions of euros to invest in the state - what some in Germany have called a \"fiscal bazooka\".\nIt is also an important moment for Ukraine. The defence plans approved today by the Bundestag also allow spending on aid for states \"attacked in violation of international law\" to be exempt from the debt brake.\nThat will enable outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz to release \u20ac3bn in aid to Ukraine as early as next week.\nMerz chose to push the changes through the old parliament, knowing the vote arithmetic was more favourable now than it would be after 25 March, when the new parliament session begins.\nThe far-right AFD and far-left Linke, which both performed well in February's election, oppose Merz's plans.\nMerz has still not agreed a coalition deal to govern Germany after his election win, and has announced ambitious plans to have a government in place by Easter.\nCoalition negotiations in Germany, however, can drag on for months at a time.",

I was saying  to my husband 'look at this message, how brilliant is that'. I'm just so glad that it has reached somebody and did good.\"\nJoel was also touched by the message.\n\"It's amazing\u2026 TikTok's been an amazing thing,\" he says.\nClare says she has also had to deal with a small number of hurtful comments. \nFollowing a \"really horrible comment\" she posted a video in response.\nShe said: \"To that person and all the other people that didn't get enough love as a child, I'm going to prove on here that people with Down's syndrome can do absolutely anything...\n\"[Joel] certainly wouldn't say a nasty word about anybody, certainly not somebody he doesn't even know so I wish there were less people like you in the world and more people like Joel.\" \nRecalling that post, Clare says she usually chooses to \"ignore the negativity\" but felt she had to speak out that day.\n\"It doesn't bother us,\" she says. \nClaire was 24  and had not long been married when she discovered she was pregnant.\nShe says she had all the usual scans throughout her pregnancy but only discovered Joel had Down's syndrome after he was born.  \n\"I thought there was something off because everyone kept asking if I was okay and put me in a room on my own,\" she recalls. \nWhen a paediatric consultant came to see her she asked him if everything was OK.\n\"He said 'we're 99% sure that your little boy has Down's syndrome',\" she says. \n\"It frightened me to death because I didn't know anything about it at all\u2026 it was a scary, scary time.\"\nClare and Joel's dad barely had time for the news to sink in before Joel became critically ill.\nClare says after being told he had two holes in the heart, bowel disorder Hirschsprung's disease and seeing him in an incubator she gained a new perspective.\n\"I didn't care what he had, I just wanted Joel to be alive and be OK\u2026. so I came to terms with [him having Down's syndrome] relatively quickly,\" she says.\nJoel spent his first five years of his life in and out of hospital.\n\"You're so grateful for every single milestone and I still am,\" says Clare.\nClare and Joel's dad separated when he was a teenager and Joel now lives with Clare and his step-dad and has four step siblings.\nHe spends two nights a week at his dad's house. \n\"You've got a hot tub there haven't you Joel, you like to put the music on,\" says Claire.\n\"We're away with the fairies having a few cans,\" says Joel, prompting Clare to erupt into laughter. \n\"Away with the fairies,\" she laughs.\nWith Joel now a grown man there has inevitably been some talk of him moving out of the family home.\nBut there's a sticking point - some of Joel's friends who are slightly older than him have moved into assisted living but that does not appeal to Joel.\n\"Joel wants to live in the West End with all the actresses so I'm trying to get into Joel's head that's not going to happen,\" laughs Clare.\n\"But no Clare, let me speak,\" interrupts Joel.\n\"I want to be in the West End, on stage.\"\n\"But we're not thinking about moving out yet are we,\" says Clare.\n\"Not yet,\" answers Joel, \"but if I had a girlfriend - Sophie Evans?\".\nJoel is a super fan of Welsh singer and actress Sophie Evans, who played Glinda in the West End production of Wicked.\nThe pair have met many times when Joel and Clare have gone to see her perform and she visited the family in August for Joel's birthday. \n\"She's married,\" laughs Clare.\n\"She has a child and another one on the way.\"\n\"I'm the father,\" says Joel, and the pair peal into laughter.\nThis kind of exchange is typical and precisely what is keeping their followers on TikTok entertained. \n\"We laugh most of the time and then cry from laughing,\" says Joel. \n\"I've got a wonderful mother, she's the best. Since I've been a baby I've had an amazing life and she's been with me every step I take and she's an amazing, amazing cook.\"\nClare says listening to Joel speak about her like this this makes her emotional. \n\"We're always together, we're very tactile, Joel loves a cwtch [cuddle] and we have nice chats,\" she says. \n\"I'm just really extremely proud of him.\"\n \"My life is amazing, fantastic,\" says Joel. \n\"I wouldn't change it for the world.\"",

        "article_text": "Debra Eichenbaum got her two young children vaccinated against the measles virus 20 years ago, and - like millions of other parents - hadn't thought about the highly contagious disease since.\nBut when cases across the US began to climb this year, the 62-year-old began to worry about how best to protect her husband, David, who is immunocompromised after surviving pancreatic cancer.\nSo she got another measles shot, and emailed friends her age, encouraging them to check with their doctors to make sure they were still immunised.\n\"There's no downside to it,\" she said. \"For me, that was a no-brainer.\"\nMs Eichenbaum is just one adult who debated an extra shot when cases spiked across the US. Others are thinking about their children, who may not yet have been immunised against the virus.\n\"There is a lot of confusion out there right now, especially in light of differences in how different age groups of the population have been vaccinated based on what the recommendations were at the time of their vaccination,\" said Donald Dumford III, an infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic.\nThe US declared it had eliminated measles from the country in 2000, after decades of access to a safe and effective vaccine. But since the Covid-19 pandemic and an increase in vaccine scepticism, the number of measles outbreaks has risen.\nThere have been over 300 cases in 2025 across more than a dozen states. This year, the US saw the first measles death in a decade: a 6-year-old girl in western Texas, the epicentre of an outbreak that has spread to neighbouring New Mexico and Oklahoma.\nMeasles is a dangerous virus that has no cure and can lead to a host of complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. It can be deadly. \nVaccination rates must be 95% or higher for the broader population to be protected, but several communities where the virus is spreading have rates well below that. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases that exists, spreading very easily if people are unprotected, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nHealth Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine-sceptic, has sent mixed messages about the outbreak, at times encouraging people to talk to their doctor about vaccines, and at other moments, promoting alternative treatments not recommended by public health experts.\nThe federal government has not offered any guidance about whether certain adults should talk to their doctor about getting another shot - or whether parents in hotspots should consider getting their young children vaccinated sooner.\nAsked for comment, the US Department of Health and Human Services referred the BBC to existing measles vaccine guidance from the CDC.\nMs Eichenbaum decided on another measles vaccine over concerns that some people vaccinated in the 1960s may have received a less effective dose. \nThose vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 may have received what is known as an inactivated measles vaccine, and should consider getting an additional shot, said Melissa Stockwell, a professor of paediatrics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\nThose who are unsure about their vaccination status can either search for their written vaccination records or have their antibody levels checked with a blood test, doctors say.\nAdults born earlier than 1957 likely had measles as a child and are considered immune, Dr Stockwell said.\n\"The recommendation is that anyone who does not have presumptive immunity should be vaccinated,\" she said.\nFor weeks before his new baby was born, Kyle Rable and his pregnant wife exchanged anxious messages throughout the day, wondering how they could best keep their future son safe from measles.\n\"It's basically both of our constant thoughts all the time,\" said Mr Rable, whose wife gave birth to their son, Steven, earlier this month in the same hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where a child died of measles just a week before.\nThe outbreak in western Texas has raised the alarm for parents across the state and in the wider region, especially those who have young babies who cannot yet be immunised.\nThe measles vaccine is not generally recommended for children who are under a year old because the shots do not work as well before that age, doctors say. \nIt is a two-dose vaccine. Typically, children are given their first shot between the ages of 12 and 15 months, and then another between ages 4 and 6.\nBut for young children who live near a measles outbreak, paediatricians may recommend a shot at an earlier age, between six and 11 months, said Stuart Ray, professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nMr Rable plans to ask about vaccination plans at his son's two-week checkup, and will \"100%\" vaccinate his child early if the doctor recommends it.\nChildren vaccinated before they are a year old still need two additional standard doses of the measles vaccine later on, Dr Ray said.\n\"There's no harm in getting the additional doses,\" said Tony Moody, a paediatrics professor at Duke University School of Medicine. \"The decision about getting an early MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) should be a conversation between the family and their paediatrician.\"\nChildren can get a second dose as soon as 28 days after their first shot.\n\"The vaccine starts providing some protection within weeks of the first dose,\" Dr Ray said.\nParents hoping to get their children vaccinated against measles, or adults looking for another dose, can make an appointment at a pharmacy. \nHowever, some pharmacies - especially in Texas, the epicentre of the outbreak - have seen vaccine shortages because of higher demand.  \nThe CDC has provided thousands of doses to the state. \nLocal health departments in western Texas also are holding vaccination clinics, while many across the US offer the shot free of charge.

        "article_text": "As polar tourism surges, experts warn of its environmental impact. From transport choices to local food, here's how to visit responsibly while protecting fragile ecosystems.\nI first learned of Greenland's existence from a world map pinned on my childhood bedroom wall. Decades later, I finally made it to the capital, Nuuk. I'd long been fascinated by pictures of the brightly coloured wooden houses lining its rocky shores \u2013 red, yellow, green and blue against an icy backdrop. Small icebergs floated just offshore and the absence of trees gave a stark, otherworldly feel. I looked forward to experiencing the crisp, biting air, exploring Inuit art at the Nuuk Kunstmuseum and maybe, if I was lucky, spotting some seals or a passing whale.\u00a0\nI'm not the only one entranced by Greenland's icy beauty: between 2018-2023, tourism to the country grew by 46%, with 131,767 visitors arriving in 2023. Much of this surge is due to the increasing number of cruise ships navigating Arctic waters.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to the Arctic Council, ships entering the Arctic Polar Code area \u00a0\u2013 a regulated maritime zone around the North Pole \u2013 increased by 37% between 2013 and 2024. Many cruise operators, like Hurtigruten, Swan Hellenic and Ponant, offer routes encompassing Iceland, Svalbard and Greenland, with the latter expecting visitor numbers to keep growing thanks to a 2024 airport expansion in Nuuk and two more international airports set to be built by 2026.\nMeanwhile on the opposite side of the planet, Antarctica is seeing a similar tourism boom. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports a steady rise in visitors since the 1990s. In the 2022-23 season, 104,897 people visited the continent, rising to 124,262 last year. More than 80,000 of those set foot on Antarctic land \u2013\u00a0an alarming statistic for conservationists who warn that human presence can disrupt fragile ecosystems, alter animal behaviour and unwittingly bring invasive foreign organisms with them.\nAs tourism to the poles increases, organisations like the Arctic Council, the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO) and Visit Greenland stress the urgent need to balance economic benefits with environmental responsibility. The lure of the polar regions is undeniable: the near lunar landscapes; the intensity of the blue sky on a freezing, sunny day; the thrill of fresh snow crunching underfoot; and the unique wildlife that calls these places home.\nJames Grecian, a marine ecologist at Durham University, UK, and scientist-in-residence at climate advocacy nonprofit Arctic Basecamp, has spent years studying polar wildlife. Last year, he was in Antarctica studying snow petrels \u2013\u00a0or more specifically, their vomit.\nThoughtful Travel\nWant to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\nSnow petrels' stomach oil deposits freeze into solid lumps that contain, when analysed in a lab, data on how their diet has changed over the years, and in turn, what that means about the local ecosystem. \"We can tell a lot about past conditions by taking samples from the environment, or from animals,\" Grecian explains. \"For example, the baleen plates of whales can be taken from dead animals, and the chemical signatures will tell you something about the environmental conditions or what the animal was eating.\"\nAs a fairly frequent polar visitor, he understands the appeal of these environments \u2013 and also the impact. He notes there are choices we can make to reduce the damage to these vital but threatened regions. Polar tourism is showing no signs of slowing down, but Grecian hopes that, with increased awareness of its drawbacks, visitors can make the most ethical choices possible. Here are his suggestions on how to do that.\nFirst of all, you'll need to weigh up your travel options to reach the polar region of your choice.\nThe problem with a cruise ship is that you're bringing the hotel and all the services with you,\" he says. \"I've heard stories of towns being quite unhappy about the disruption when lots of people disembark. They get all their meals catered on the ship so they won't go to the local cafes. Contrast that to planes \u2013 if you fly into an area, you're going to be staying in local hotels, you're going to be using local tour operators. The communities have a chance to benefit economically. But you need to offset that against the massive carbon emissions of planes.\"\u00a0\nWhile ships may seem a greener alternative to flying, global data suggests otherwise. Aviation accounts for 2.5% of CO2 emissions globally, while shipping contributes slightly more at 3% (although most of that is from cargo ships). There's also the noise pollution issue \u2013\u00a0the hum of ships' engines has been shown\u00a0to disrupt whales' echolocation ability.\n\"There's a horrible video \u2013 an animation based on real blue whale migration tracking, and it's a blue whale caught in shipping lanes,\" says Grecian. \"It's like a pinball in a machine; it keeps turning around and turning back because of the amount of noise that the ships produce.\"\nSo what's the alternative?\u00a0\n\"Using trains is about a 90% or 95% reduction in CO2, so from a climate perspective, a train to Norway for the fjords is a better option.\" It is possible \u2013\u00a0but takes much longer \u2013\u00a0to reach parts of the Arctic by train, even if flights are required for some of the journey. There's direct trains to Narvik in the Norwegian Arctic from Stockholm; from Trondheim to Bod\u00f8 in Norway or from Helsinki to Rovaniemi in the north of Finland.\nOr you could \u2013\u00a0if you have the money \u2013\u00a0charter a small sailing boat. \"I know people in the Falklands who sail to Antarctica fairly regularly,\" says Grecian. \"The cost of [a private charter] probably wouldn't be far off the cost of a berth on a fancy cruise ship.\"\nPolar wildlife is a big draw for visitors, but Grecian cautions against disturbing the very animals people come to see.\u00a0\n\"You must be appreciative of being a guest in that environment and try to treat it with as much respect as you can,\" says Grecian. \"There can be a tendency these days to try and get selfies with animals and that can cause a lot of disturbance. They're not used to seeing people, so give them space. You shouldn't be trying to chase them down.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Will you be going on holiday to\u2026 Greenland next year?\n\u2022\u00a0Antarctic tourism: Should we just say no?\n\u2022\u00a0Could airships be the next cruise ships?\nGrecian recommends patience. \"If you sit quietly, some animals are quite curious. I haven't seen penguins in Antarctica but I have in the Falklands, and they came within 3-4m (10-13ft). So if you're quiet and still, you might get a visitor.\"\nLocal guides can also provide essential knowledge \u2013 plus Grecian says that sometimes it's about noticing the small things. \"Some people say you should always look up, but if you look down, you can see signs of animals. You might see footprints in the mud, or scat that will give you a suggestion of what animals might have passed through.\"\nThat might sound drastic, but if you're visiting on land rather than on a cruise, there is a good reason to eat local products. Transporting supplies to these remote areas carries a significant carbon footprint \u2013 globally, food production contributes three billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually.\n\u00a0In Greenland and parts of Arctic Canada, many Inuit communities still\u00a0subsistence hunt. Their hunting rights are legally protected in Canada and in Greenland, and are regulated to prevent over-hunting. \"The rights of the Indigenous population to pursue traditional hunting practices is enshrined in law,\" says Grecian. \"The meat of a ring seal or a harp seal in Greenland will have a much lower carbon footprint than imported meat or non-native crops.\"\nOf course, your personal comfort levels at the idea of eating seal meat are yours to decide, but bear in mind that if you're visiting a majority-Inuit region like Greenland, the alternatives are limited and local meat is the more environmentally-friendly option \u2013\u00a0a study comparing the carbon footprint of imported meat and local seal in Greenland found seal had the lowest footprint compared to pork and poultry.\nFor the intrepid travellers planning on camping or venturing off the beaten track, it's vital to have the right gear \u2013\u00a0and not just the obvious things like base layers, shoe spikes and waterproofs.\n\"If you're going somewhere particularly cold or out camping in more remote parts, you can hire gear in the country,\" says Grecian. Not only will it make your suitcase lighter; it'll benefit the local economy.\"\nBut when it comes to packing for your visit, Grecian offers tips on some practical but often forgotten items. \"Nasal spray,\" he says. \"Cold environments tend to be dry, so the inside of your nose can dry out and can bleed.\" And don't underestimate the strength of polar Sun \u2013 Grecian recommends taking factor 50 sunscreen. If you're camping or in other basic, remote accommodation, you might want some creature comforts, too: \"On an expedition, coffee is vital for me. On my last trip I took a moka pot and a French press!\"\nGrecian laughs when I tell him that, on my visit to Greenland, I didn't see a single whale. I went in October \u2013\u00a0the start of winter, just as humpback whales begin their migration to the Caribbean.\n\"If there's a specific activity or animal you want, look up their migration patterns,\" he says. And if it's a natural phenomenon, check when it occurs. \"For instance, a lot of people go to Newfoundland in May or June [to see] grass and flowers against the backdrop of icebergs. If you want to see that you have to go at that specific time of year.\"\nHis advice underscores a broader idea: polar travel should be guided by what's best for the natural world, not just what looks good on social media.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

Sporting announced his transfer fee as \u00a318.4m.\nHe has impressed in Spain, but has also picked up two red cards in his past four games.\nWhile Chelsea fans must wait a while to see Quenda, Essugo could join up with Enzo Maresca's side for the inaugural Fifa Club World Cup this summer in the United States.\nThe Portuguese pair are the latest young players signed by the London club, who have already confirmed moves for two other 17-year-olds this summer.\nBrazilian Estevao Willian and Ecuadorian Kendry Paez will also move to Chelsea in the summer.\nDario Essugo was given his second red card of the season against Real Betis this month\n\"He is a very creative player. He is a very young player and has a lot of potential to achieve,\" Portuguese football journalist and pundit Mariana Fernandes told BBC Sport.\n\"A right-winger with a left foot - so he has a left foot but also likes to go through opponents with his right foot, which becomes very confusing for defenders to try and stop him.\n\"He is really quick, really smart and mature in the way he transforms the game.\"\nQuenda was born in the African nation of Guinea-Bissau but moved to Portugal as a child and joined a small club on the outskirts of Lisbon. He caught the eye of Benfica scouts and spent two years in their academy before moving closer to home and joining Sporting.\nIn 2023 he signed his first professional contract and, while with the reserve team, caught the eye of ex-Sporting manager Ruben Amorim, who gave him his senior debut in the Portuguese Super Cup at the beginning of this campaign.\nAt just 17 years and 95 days, the Portugal Under-21 international became the club's youngest ever goalscorer with his strike in a 4-3 defeat by Porto.\nQuenda recorded 20 goal contributions in 33 appearances for Sporting's under-23s last season and now has 10 goals involvements in 44 games this campaign.\nWhile he was deployed on the wing to help both attack and defence under now Manchester United boss Amorim, he has moved into a more offensive role in a front three under Sporting's new head coach Rui Borges.\n\"He is a very complete player, a very put together player,\" Fernandes added. \"He has the mentality that he always has to go back and help the team to defend. He doesn't stay up front.\n\"I think the right word to describe Quenda is he is a very brave player.\n\"His main strength is one on one challenges. He is really strong on the duels with the ball at his feet. It is very rare for a defender here in Portugal to stop Quenda in a duel or one on one challenge.\"\nFernandes also told BBC Sport that Quendas had a 100m euro (\u00a384m) release clause, but that Sporting would sell for about half that price with the right negotiations.\n\"With Sporting having almost another season-and-a-half with the player, this did the trick for Chelsea to seize the opportunity,\" Fernandes said.\n\"He is going to a team that explores youth and young players and I think that is what Chelsea saw.\n\"To seize the opportunity to sign a player who in two seasons time would be double the price and would be much harder to sign.\"\nHe is impressing with his pace, strength and technical ability already, but would he be ready to step up to the Premier League level?\n\"He is a generational talent,\" Ferandes believes.\n\"The mentality is there, psychologically he is there and I think he is ready to play for Chelsea and to play in the Premier League.\n\"He will need to adapt to playing in a bigger league, a bigger club, with bigger challenges and bigger opponents.\"\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone",

He did it at the behest of a local agent in his town in the southern Indian state of Kerala.\nIt was the promise of a better life for their child who has special needs that prodded the couple to dip into their savings and take such a risk. But when they got to the UK there was no work.\n\"We kept chasing the care home, but they made up excuses. After I pleaded with them, they forced us to undergo some unpaid training and gave my wife just three days of work,\" Mr George said. \"We couldn't carry on and came back to India a few months later.\"\nMr George believes he has been scammed by the company and says the ordeal has set him back at least by a decade financially. His family is just one among hundreds of people from Kerala seeking work in the UK who have been exploited by recruiters, care homes and middlemen.\nMost have now given up hope of getting justice or their money.\nAlchita Care in Bradford has not responded to the BBC's questions. Their sponsorship licence - which allows care homes to issue certificates of sponsorship to foreign care workers applying for visas - was removed by the Home Office last year.\nBut at least three other care workers who sent thousands of pounds to Alchita Care and uprooted their lives from Kerala told us that the jobs they had been promised did not materialise.\nOne of them, still in the UK, said his condition was so precarious that he was surviving on \"bread and milk\" from charity shops for the past few months.\nLike Mr George, Sridevi (not her real name) says she was charged \u00a315,000 for a visa sponsorship by Alchita Care. She spent another \u00a33,000 to get to the UK in 2023.\nShe's unable to return to India, scared of facing family members and friends from whom she took a loan to make the trip.\n\"I struggle to even pay for my rent and meals,\" she said. Her job is a far cry from the stable eight-hour work she was promised, she says. She is sometimes on call from 4am to 9pm, driving from one patient's home to another, but gets paid only for the few hours she is actually with the patient, and not the full shift.\nThousands of nurses from Kerala, desperate to migrate to the UK every year, are estimated to have been exploited after the government added care workers to the UK's shortage occupation list during Covid. This allowed people to be recruited from overseas as long as they were sponsored.\nFor many, the care worker visa was a golden ticket to a better life as they could take family along.\nBaiju Thittala, a Labour party member and the mayor of Cambridge, told the BBC he had represented at least 10 such victims over the last three years.\nBut the cross-border nature of these exploitative schemes means it has been incredibly hard to pursue justice, he said. Very often the victims have made payments to care homes or middlemen domiciled outside India which leads to \"jurisdiction problems\", he added.\nSecondly, lawyers are expensive and most care workers, already in deep debt, can hardly afford to fight it out in the courts.\nThittala estimates at least 1,000-2,000 people from Kerala, directly or indirectly victims of these schemes, are still in the UK.\nThere are also hundreds of people scattered across Kerala's towns who lost money before they could even leave home.\nIn the town of Kothamangalam, the BBC spoke to some 30 people who had collectively lost millions of dollars while trying to obtain a care visa that allows professionals to come to - or stay - in the UK to work in the social care sector.\nAll of them accused one agent - Henry Poulos and his agency Grace International in the UK and India - of robbing them of their life savings through fake job offers and sponsorship letters.\nMr Poulos even made some of them take a 2,500km journey to Delhi for visa appointments that were non-existent, they said.\nShilpa, who lives in the town of Alleppey, told the BBC she had taken out a bank loan at a 13% interest rate to pay Mr Poulos, who gave her a fake certificate of sponsorship.\n\"I thought the UK would offer a good future for my three daughters, but now I am struggling to pay their school fees,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I have lost everything. My wife had left her job in Israel so that we could move to the UK,\" said another victim, Binu, breaking down. He made a comfortable \u00a31,500 with his wife in Israel but has now been forced to take his children out of private school in Kerala because there's no money anymore.\nNeither Mr Poulos nor Grace International responded to the BBC, despite repeated attempts to get in touch with them. The police in Kothamangalam said Mr Poulos was absconding in the UK, and they had sealed his local offices after receiving complaints from six people.\nThe previous Conservative government in the UK admitted last year that there was \"clear evidence\" that care workers were being offered visas under false pretences and paid far below the minimum wage required for their work.\nRules to reduce its misuse were tightened in 2024, including increasing the minimum salary. Care workers are also now restricted from taking dependents, making it a less attractive proposition for families.\nSince July 2022, about 450 licences allowing employers to recruit foreign workers have been revoked in the care sector.\nSince the beginning of this year, sponsors are now also explicitly prohibited by the Home Office from passing on the cost of the sponsor licence fee or associated administrative costs to prospective employees. \nTop police officials in Kerala, meanwhile, told the BBC they were still investigating these cases in India and would work with Interpol agencies to crack down on agents, if necessary.\nBut for the hundreds who've already been exploited, justice remains elusive, and still very much a distant dream.",

This allowed people to be recruited from overseas as long as they were sponsored.The carers crossing the globe to fill UK shortageFor many, the care worker visa was a golden ticket to a better life as they could take family along.Baiju Thittala, a Labour party member and the mayor of Cambridge, told the BBC he had represented at least 10 such victims over the last three years.But the cross-border nature of these exploitative schemes means it has been incredibly hard to pursue justice, he said.",

        "article_text": "Oscar (left) joined Shanghai Port from Chelsea for a reported \u00a360m in January 2017\nWhen China's president, Xi Jinping, visited Manchester in October 2015, there followed a bizarre photo opportunity and a bold statement.\nThe former was an image of two global leaders - Xi and then UK Prime Minister David Cameron - posing alongside Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero. The unlikely selfie went viral on social media.\nThe latter laid out a target that seemed much more likely for a nation of 1.4 billion people - and the football world took notice.\nIn a written interview with the news agency Reuters, President Xi said he wanted China's national team to become \"one of the best in the world\".\nSix months after Xi's visit to the UK, the Chinese government launched a strategy that aimed to make the country a \"world football superpower\" by 2050.\nIn the long term, the president wanted China to host and be competitive at the men's World Cup. By 2030, he wanted China to be one of the best teams in Asia.\nWhen the strategy was announced, China were 81st in the Fifa world rankings. Today, they sit 90th - wedged between New Zealand and the Caribbean island of Curacao.\nChina's only appearance at a men's World Cup remains at the 2002 tournament in Japan and South Korea, where they were eliminated in the group stage.\nShould they lose to Saudi Arabia and Australia in this month's international break, it would almost certainly end their hopes of reaching the next edition in 2026.\nDespite that, some of Xi's aims are already taking shape - his strategy having been set out over three stages, spanning 34 years.\nOne of them was to get tens of millions of young people playing the sport regularly. China's community football projects have indeed been hugely upscaled, with pitches now accessible all over the country.\n\"This absolutely kicked into high gear from 2016 - football pitches were springing up everywhere,\" says Dr Mike Gow - an expert in contemporary China at Edge Hill University.\n\"You're never more than about 10 minutes' walk from either a half-size or full-size all-weather pitch. The scale of it is quite impressive.\"\nXi Jinping posed for a selfie with Sergio Aguero and David Cameron when he visited the UK in 2015\nBut while access has improved, adopting a football culture similar to Europe and the UK is proving more challenging.\nIn 2018, David Sproer was working as a coach in Cologne when he was presented with an opportunity to work for the Shanghai Football Association as a youth coach in the women's game.\n\"It felt like a gold rush,\" he says. \"It felt like things were really taking off, and that Chinese football could make huge steps towards a brighter future.\"\nSproer left the country, along with many other European coaches, during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nHe says he has no regrets about his time in China, but believes parts of his experience shone a light on why the country is so dominant in Olympic sports such as gymnastics, diving and table tennis but has struggled in football, where cohesion and communication play a more important role.\n\"Chinese kids are educated and socialised a little differently from European kids,\" he says. \"They grow up with an understanding that there is always a right and a wrong answer.\n\"You have to be a little bit more versatile in football than, say, diving. It's not about perfection, it's also about creativity.\"\nThe growth of the game among young people has also suffered as a result of the perception of football in the country.\nIn December 2024, former Everton midfielder Li Tie was sentenced to 20 years in prison for fixing matches and accepting bribes. He had been China's men's national team coach from January 2020 to December 2021.\nThe saga was the latest in a string of corruption cases that have blighted Chinese football over many years. According to Sproer, they have had an impact on the number of parents willing to volunteer to help in organising youth teams.\n\"Kids are under enormous academic pressure. The parents are under pressure in their jobs,\" he says.\n\"So there isn't much time to volunteer, and there is also not this culture of volunteering, because football in China in the professional leagues doesn't have the greatest image.\"\nHulk spent five season in the Chinese Super League, scoring 51 goals in 100 games\nThree months before Li Tie's sentencing, Chinese football had suffered a blow, with a 7-0 defeat by bitter rivals Japan in World Cup qualifying.\n\"This is like England getting hammered by Germany,\" says Dr Gow.\n\"Fans were angry, but they were more exasperated. Exasperated at the state of the game, and exasperated at the level of corruption in the game.\"\nWhen Xi set out his football plan in 2016, it led to a wave of investment from Chinese private investors in British and European clubs.\nThe Chinese Super League (CSL) had its own resurgence, with wealthy owners pumping money into clubs to finance moves for players such as Oscar, from Chelsea, and Hulk from Zenit St Petersburg.\nNow, only two Chinese investors have overall control of professional clubs in England - the Fosun International Group at Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Dai Yongge, whose tenure at Reading has been beset by financial crises and successive points deductions.\nAnd clubs in the CSL are counting the cost of their transfer spending, with Guangzhou Evergrande, who won eight domestic titles and two Asian Champions Leagues between 2011 and 2019, forced into liquidation in January as a result of unpaid debts.\n\"A lot of entrepreneurs used the China football strategy as a pretext to move money out of China,\" Dr Gow says.\n\"It's very difficult to get your money out of China, so they seized on this opportunity that there was a national policy.\n\"Fairly quickly, within a two- or three-year period, the authorities came along and said 'no, this is not what we want you to be doing,' so they kind of closed the door on that outward investment.\"\nWith the presence of Chinese investors dwindling at European clubs, and with the men's national team still struggling to make inroads on the pitch, it is tempting to write off Xi's ambitions already.\nBut those who've spent time in the country still feel the targets can be met by 2050, with China's results in younger age groups signalling some progress.\n\"Never underestimate them,\" says Dr Gow.\n\"When you have the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China, and they come out with a plan like this, they tend to deliver the objectives.\"\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

They finished bottom of the table in eight of the 12 Six Nations that came before, so there is clear evidence of the team becoming more competitive.\n\"Wales, Ireland and Italy are all operating at a similar level to Scotland, and given they host all three in Edinburgh this time around, there is an opportunity to enjoy a very positive campaign that can act as a springboard towards the Rugby World Cup.\n\"The experienced heads of captain Rachel Malcolm, Jade Konkel, Chloe Rollie and Lisa Thomson are all still key figures, but whereas in previous teams they would be required to drag some of the lesser lights along with them, the dawn of professionalism in the women's game in Scotland has started to bear fruit, and now the new faces in the squad are arriving better prepared for Test rugby.\n\"Francesca McGhie, 21, has brought pace and finishing power to an exciting back-three that already boasts proven international performers such as Rollie and Rhona Lloyd.\n\"Back-row Alex Stewart was Scotland's breakout star in last year's tournament, the then 19-year-old producing some dominant displays to mark her out as not only a star of the future, but one for here and now.\n\"There looks to be an excellent blend of youth and experience in this Scotland squad, one that could produce a big year if they can generate some precious momentum in this Six Nations.\"\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast\nIoan Cunningham stood down as head coach in November following an underwhelming year of results for Wales.\nAfter finishing the Six Nations with the Wooden Spoon - only managing one narrow win over Italy - Cunningham's side achieved a solitary victory against Japan in their WXV2 campaign.\nSean Lynn, newly recruited from Gloucester-Hartpury, has taken charge.\nLynn said: \"My values as a coach are three words; caring, challenge and passionate. Everything I brought into Gloucester-Hartpury was about togetherness and making sure we were all aligned.\n\"My big value coming from Wales is how passionate and caring the family is and that's what I wanted to bring into this environment - the family and the future family that we've got in this pathway, which is super exciting.\"\nCaptain Hannah Jones, fresh off the back of a third successive PWR title with Lynn, will be a danger in the midfield with her hard running lines.\nWith excitement building around the new era, more than 10,000 tickets have already been sold for England's visit to Principality Stadium on 29 March, breaking the previous record home attendance for the team.\nHowever, a big loss for Wales is the absence of destructive prop Sisilia Tuipulotu, who will miss the tournament with a hamstring injury.\nSix Wales players to watch in Women's Six Nations\nFrance, fourth in the world rankings, are the last team to beat the Red Roses in the competition back in 2018.\nHowever, their losing run against the champions has extended to 13 games and they will need to show big improvements to mount a title challenge this year.\nUnder co-head coaches Gaelle Mignot and David Ortiz, Les Bleues struggled at WXV1, losing heavily to Canada and New Zealand.\nWing Marine Menager is likely to be the team's leading light once again.

Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking.\nFew images are as indelible as the sight of candy-coloured tulips bursting through the dark winter ground. But in the Netherlands \u2013 the world's largest exporter of the magical bloom \u2013 venerating tulips is a way of life. In the weeks leading from icy winter to spring, rows of flowers stud the country's landscape in technicolour streaks, most famously in the Bollenstreek \"Bulb Region\", stretching between the towns of Haarlem and Leiden, arching towards the North Sea. And with tulips come tourists; eager to experience the blooms for themselves.\nThe SpeciaList\nNienke Panis-Ringersma is the owner of the photography and Dutch culture blog Tulips in Holland, which now also shares its tulip photos and weekly flower updates via X, Instagram and most recently TikTok. She is a licensed national tour guide, and her husband says she eats, sleeps and dreams tulips.\nWe spoke to Nienke Panis-Ringersma, the lens behind the popular Dutch-based tulip photography blog, Tulips in Holland, to find the best tulip bloom experiences in the Netherlands. \"People in the Netherlands are very down to earth,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose images and tulip facts receive thousands of likes per month on Facebook. \"They are quite used to the flower fields. You know when it's tourist season, because the roads are clogged with people on a bike who are not used to riding bikes.\"\nNonetheless, Panis-Ringersma adores her nation's iconic bulb flower \u2013 enough to have made it her career. \"I think it's the excitement,\" she says. \"It starts around December when we can buy tulips in the florist shops. And around the third weekend of January, we celebrate National Tulip Day. Around 300,000 tulips are placed on the museum square in Amsterdam with a beautiful backdrop of the Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum. It's the start of many tulip festivals leading up to the start of spring. It's a magical place and I love the flower, the fragrance. Every tulip is unique. There is a great story to tell.\"\u00a0\nHere are Nienke Panis-Ringersma's favourite ways to experience tulip season in the Netherlands.\n1. Best overall: Keukenhof\n\"So, you ask for absolutely number one place? Visit Keukenhof,\" says Panis-Ringersma.\nEstablished in 1949, Keukenhof Gardens is undoubtedly the most popular tulip experience in the Netherlands; its lushly landscaped \"inspirational\" tulip gardens and windmills drawing over a million visitors each year during its eight-week season. \"Around 7 million bulbs are planted by hands, not by machine, every year,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose budding love for tulips was ignited by childhood visits to Keukenhof, where her grandfather volunteered as a ticket taker. \"It's the most beautiful spring garden in the world.\"\n\u00a0\nResponsible Flower Viewing\nTourists, take note; in the Netherlands, it's illegal to park near or walk through tulip fields. \"Flower fields are commercial fields,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can damage crops by entering with your normal shoes, when you bring in bacteria, especially the hyacinths are very sensitive to that. And you don't want to have people over in the fields taking photos, picking flowers over there. Some tourists think that the fields are for there for them.\"\nVisitors enjoy a wide variety of experiences at Keukenhof including picnics, flower exhibitions and didactic \"whisper boat\" cruises through the gardens, where contemporary art sculptures dot the grounds. But plan ahead; Keukenhof is open for just two months, usually from the first day of Spring to the first week of May, depending on the weather (in 2025, 20 March to 11 May). \"The best time to go is the $1m question,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's different every year\u2026 right now we have an extremely warm winter. I think the best time to visit for this year is around the middle of April.\"\nWebsite: https://keukenhof.nl/en/\nAddress: Stationsweg 166A 2161 AM Lisse\nContact: info@keukenhof.nl\nInstagram: @visitkeukenhof\n2. Best cultural experience: Catching the Bloemencorso Flower Parade\nTo truly get swept up in the excitement of tulip season, be sure to catch the Bloemencorso Flower Parade.\u00a0\n\"A flower parade is a very festive flower festival,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's about 20 different floats, marching bands, cars very lavishly decorated with all kinds of flowers, people enjoying themselves, street entertainment\u2026 every town is a very festive atmosphere.\"\nInsider Bloemencorso Flower Parade tip\nPanis-Ringersma encourages visitors to also catch the events surrounding parade day. \"Not many people know that there's the Night Parade on Friday evening,\" she says. \"It's in Noordwijkerhout, a very small town. People gather there to look at the parade floats, have a drink and have something to eat outside on the terrace.\" During the Night Parade, the floats are illuminated, creating a magical atmosphere.\nAnd on float Construction Days (Wednesday to Friday), spectators can watch volunteers decorate the floats with thousands of flowers. On Sunday afternoon, after the parade, the floats are displayed for one last time in the city of Haarlem.\nThe Bloemencorso parade takes place each year on the third Saturday of April, marching along the road from Noordwijk to Haarlem, through the Bollenstreek and past Keukenhof. \"It's a full day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"People line up at least three four lines thick to see. Some people get their seats ready at least three hours before the parade to make sure\u2026 it's like a Disney parade. People are sitting down on the streets waiting for the parade to pass by.\"\nPanis-Ringersma's tip: watch from Noordwijk. \"Lots of people try to see the parade around Keukenhof because it passes the gardens,\" she says. \"But that's an extremely busy spot. Go to Noordwijk early in the morning. It's a beautiful seaside town.\"\nWhile waiting for the parade, feast on Dutch Stroopwafel cookies, or have lunch at Panis-Ringersma's casual Dutch dining pick, Hudson Restaurant. \"It's a very festive day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"Every town is having markets \u2026 it's an absolute must-see for people traveling to the Netherlands.\"\nWebsite: https://bloemencorso-bollenstreek.nl/en/\nPhone: +31 (0)252 428 237\nInstagram: @bloemencorsobollenstreek\n3. Best interactive experience: Visiting a tulip farm\nFor those who aren't satisfied merely admiring the blooms from afar, Panis-Ringersma suggests visiting a tulip farm. \"Because everybody really wants to go into the fields, which is not allowed,\" she says. \"So, please go to a tulip farm where it is allowed!\"\nPanis-Ringersma's three farm recommendations are all found in the heart of the Bollenstreek. \"All three are founded by bulb growers,\" she says. \"So, they know absolutely what they are doing. They're all a very hands-on experience.\"\nThe family-run Tulip Experience in Noordwijkerhout is Panis-Ringersma's first pick; home to nearly 1 million tulips. \"You can go to the field where you can see at least 700 different types of tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can visit the tulip market with all kinds of products made of tulips or with tulips on it. You can pick your own tulips. It's a very fun experience.\" What sort of tulip products? \"Beer with tulips, tulip vodka, tulip Aperol Spritz, soap smelling of tulips, vases, napkins with tulips, wallets with tulips,\" she says. \"If you can name it, everything with tulips.\"\nAlternatively, visit Tulip Barn in Hillegom just 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, where visitors can immerse themselves in the 750,000 tulips sprawling across the farm's gardens and production field. \"They are more focused on making Instagrammable photos,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"So, for a bit younger target audience.\"\nHeading further south, Panis-Ringersma also likes De Tulperij in Voorhout. \"You can go together with the bulb grower,\" she says. \"You're walking into the fields. He will dig up some tulip bulbs and will show you how they are growing and what they are doing each year to make them grow. It's a very interesting environment.\"\nWebsite: https://tulipexperienceamsterdam.nl\nAddress: Delfweg 37, 2211 VK Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands\nPhone: +31651368784\nInstagram: @tulipexperienceamsterdam\n4. Best for kids: Tulip picking\nFor visitors with antsy kids (and a car), Panis-Ringersma loves tulip picking in the Bollenstreek. \"Not in the regular fields where you can say as you're walking, 'Oh, I like this one!'\" she says. \"No, just go to a to a picking farm and pick your own tulips.\"\nTulip Road Trip Map\nWhen roaming the Bollenstreek, it's helpful to have a plan \u2013 like Panis-Ringersma's helpful tulip road trip map; perfect for navigating the area by car or by bike.\n\"The green map square is Keukenhof,\" she explains. \"All the yellow stars are flower fields. The pink line is a long route among various flower fields; the blue is a route towards the beach. And when you drive by bike or by car, you will absolutely find tulip fields in bloom regardless the time of season during springtime.\"\nThere are several picking farms in the Bollenstreek area, but Panis-Ringersma recommends heading to Annemieke's Pluktuin, a tulip nursery in Hillegom run by husband-and-wife team, Annemieke and Pieter. \"Pluktuin is literally 'picking garden',\" explains Panis-Ringersma. \"Tulip picking is an absolutely brilliant experience, especially when you go with children to walk into the field and get the tulip with the bulb and you can take the bulb and the tulip with you back home or to the hotel.\"\nWebsite: https://www.annemiekespluktuin.nl\nAddress: Haarlemmerstraat 15A, 2182 HA Hillegom, Netherlands\nPhone: +31653839979\nInstagram: @pickinggardenholland\n5. Best for tulip aficionados: Hortus Bulborum\nFor Panis-Ringersma, whose passion for tulip photography led her to become an expert in tulip horticulture, the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen is a sacred institute of learning.\nDid You Know?\n\"An interesting fact about tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's not native to the Netherlands but people think it is.\" Tulips are, in fact, native to the Himalayas, where they flourished as a small red mountain flower before being brought to Turkey in the 1400s. \"People from Turkey went to the Himalayas and took this magical flower,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They thought, 'Oh, it's very interesting. Let's see if we can make it taller or different colours.' At the end of the 16th Century, it came to the Netherlands. People would have thought, 'Okay, it's a very ugly bulb, but there comes a beautiful flower out of it.'\"\n\"It's like a living museum,\" she says. \"Tulips entered the Netherlands around the 16th Century. And people loved them from the very beginning. And right now, there is one place in the Netherlands that keep the bulbs alive from the 16th Century and later on. So, this is a place where you can visit and find the oldest bulbs of the Netherlands still blooming.\"\nThe Hortus Bulborum houses more than 4,500 varieties of historical spring bulbous plants, from tulips to daffodils to hyacinths, which are rarely cultivated in modern day. The garden's star bulbs include a specimen of Fritillaria Persica, dating to 1557, and the ancient 16th-Century tulip Duc van Tol Red and Yellow.\n\"So, you can visit and it's a very small garden,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They have great apple pie! So absolutely visit and drink some coffee with apple pie over there and have a look at all the different kinds of flowers.\"\nWebsite: https://hortus-bulborum.nl/en/\nAddress: Zuidkerkenlaan 23A, 1906 AC Limmen, Netherlands\nPhone: +31617291643\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hortusbulborum/\n\u00a0\nThis article was originally published 31 March 2024 and has been updated to reflect the 2025 opening and closing dates for Keukenhof Gardens.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife and Travel, delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Travel, head over to our Facebook page or message us on X.",

Sporting announced his transfer fee as \u00a318.4m.\nHe has impressed in Spain, but has also picked up two red cards in his past four games.\nWhile Chelsea fans must wait a while to see Quenda, Essugo could join up with Enzo Maresca's side for the inaugural Fifa Club World Cup this summer in the United States.\nThe Portuguese pair are the latest young players signed by the London club, who have already confirmed moves for two other 17-year-olds this summer.\nBrazilian Estevao Willian and Ecuadorian Kendry Paez will also move to Chelsea in the summer.\nDario Essugo was given his second red card of the season against Real Betis this month\n\"He is a very creative player. He is a very young player and has a lot of potential to achieve,\" Portuguese football journalist and pundit Mariana Fernandes told BBC Sport.\n\"A right-winger with a left foot - so he has a left foot but also likes to go through opponents with his right foot, which becomes very confusing for defenders to try and stop him.\n\"He is really quick, really smart and mature in the way he transforms the game.\"\nQuenda was born in the African nation of Guinea-Bissau but moved to Portugal as a child and joined a small club on the outskirts of Lisbon. He caught the eye of Benfica scouts and spent two years in their academy before moving closer to home and joining Sporting.\nIn 2023 he signed his first professional contract and, while with the reserve team, caught the eye of ex-Sporting manager Ruben Amorim, who gave him his senior debut in the Portuguese Super Cup at the beginning of this campaign.\nAt just 17 years and 95 days, the Portugal Under-21 international became the club's youngest ever goalscorer with his strike in a 4-3 defeat by Porto.\nQuenda recorded 20 goal contributions in 33 appearances for Sporting's under-23s last season and now has 10 goals involvements in 44 games this campaign.\nWhile he was deployed on the wing to help both attack and defence under now Manchester United boss Amorim, he has moved into a more offensive role in a front three under Sporting's new head coach Rui Borges.\n\"He is a very complete player, a very put together player,\" Fernandes added. \"He has the mentality that he always has to go back and help the team to defend. He doesn't stay up front.\n\"I think the right word to describe Quenda is he is a very brave player.\n\"His main strength is one on one challenges. He is really strong on the duels with the ball at his feet. It is very rare for a defender here in Portugal to stop Quenda in a duel or one on one challenge.\"\nFernandes also told BBC Sport that Quendas had a 100m euro (\u00a384m) release clause, but that Sporting would sell for about half that price with the right negotiations.\n\"With Sporting having almost another season-and-a-half with the player, this did the trick for Chelsea to seize the opportunity,\" Fernandes said.\n\"He is going to a team that explores youth and young players and I think that is what Chelsea saw.\n\"To seize the opportunity to sign a player who in two seasons time would be double the price and would be much harder to sign.\"\nHe is impressing with his pace, strength and technical ability already, but would he be ready to step up to the Premier League level?\n\"He is a generational talent,\" Ferandes believes.\n\"The mentality is there, psychologically he is there and I think he is ready to play for Chelsea and to play in the Premier League.\n\"He will need to adapt to playing in a bigger league, a bigger club, with bigger challenges and bigger opponents.\"\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Nienke Panis-Ringersma has made a career out of following the region's famous blooms. Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking.\nFew images are as indelible as the sight of candy-coloured tulips bursting through the dark winter ground. But in the Netherlands \u2013 the world's largest exporter of the magical bloom \u2013 venerating tulips is a way of life. In the weeks leading from icy winter to spring, rows of flowers stud the country's landscape in technicolour streaks, most famously in the Bollenstreek \"Bulb Region\", stretching between the towns of Haarlem and Leiden, arching towards the North Sea. And with tulips come tourists; eager to experience the blooms for themselves.\nThe SpeciaList\nNienke Panis-Ringersma is the owner of the photography and Dutch culture blog Tulips in Holland, which now also shares its tulip photos and weekly flower updates via X, Instagram and most recently TikTok. She is a licensed national tour guide, and her husband says she eats, sleeps and dreams tulips.\nWe spoke to Nienke Panis-Ringersma, the lens behind the popular Dutch-based tulip photography blog, Tulips in Holland, to find the best tulip bloom experiences in the Netherlands. \"People in the Netherlands are very down to earth,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose images and tulip facts receive thousands of likes per month on Facebook. \"They are quite used to the flower fields. You know when it's tourist season, because the roads are clogged with people on a bike who are not used to riding bikes.\"\nNonetheless, Panis-Ringersma adores her nation's iconic bulb flower \u2013 enough to have made it her career. \"I think it's the excitement,\" she says. \"It starts around December when we can buy tulips in the florist shops. And around the third weekend of January, we celebrate National Tulip Day. Around 300,000 tulips are placed on the museum square in Amsterdam with a beautiful backdrop of the Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum. It's the start of many tulip festivals leading up to the start of spring. It's a magical place and I love the flower, the fragrance. Every tulip is unique. There is a great story to tell.\"\u00a0\nHere are Nienke Panis-Ringersma's favourite ways to experience tulip season in the Netherlands.\n1. Best overall: Keukenhof\n\"So, you ask for absolutely number one place? Visit Keukenhof,\" says Panis-Ringersma.\nEstablished in 1949, Keukenhof Gardens is undoubtedly the most popular tulip experience in the Netherlands; its lushly landscaped \"inspirational\" tulip gardens and windmills drawing over a million visitors each year during its eight-week season. \"Around 7 million bulbs are planted by hands, not by machine, every year,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose budding love for tulips was ignited by childhood visits to Keukenhof, where her grandfather volunteered as a ticket taker. \"It's the most beautiful spring garden in the world.\"\n\u00a0\nResponsible Flower Viewing\nTourists, take note; in the Netherlands, it's illegal to park near or walk through tulip fields. \"Flower fields are commercial fields,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can damage crops by entering with your normal shoes, when you bring in bacteria, especially the hyacinths are very sensitive to that. And you don't want to have people over in the fields taking photos, picking flowers over there. Some tourists think that the fields are for there for them.\"\nVisitors enjoy a wide variety of experiences at Keukenhof including picnics, flower exhibitions and didactic \"whisper boat\" cruises through the gardens, where contemporary art sculptures dot the grounds. But plan ahead; Keukenhof is open for just two months, usually from the first day of Spring to the first week of May, depending on the weather (in 2025, 20 March to 11 May). \"The best time to go is the $1m question,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's different every year\u2026 right now we have an extremely warm winter. I think the best time to visit for this year is around the middle of April.\"\nWebsite: https://keukenhof.nl/en/\nAddress: Stationsweg 166A 2161 AM Lisse\nContact: info@keukenhof.nl\nInstagram: @visitkeukenhof\n2. Best cultural experience: Catching the Bloemencorso Flower Parade\nTo truly get swept up in the excitement of tulip season, be sure to catch the Bloemencorso Flower Parade.\u00a0\n\"A flower parade is a very festive flower festival,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's about 20 different floats, marching bands, cars very lavishly decorated with all kinds of flowers, people enjoying themselves, street entertainment\u2026 every town is a very festive atmosphere.\"\nInsider Bloemencorso Flower Parade tip\nPanis-Ringersma encourages visitors to also catch the events surrounding parade day. \"Not many people know that there's the Night Parade on Friday evening,\" she says. \"It's in Noordwijkerhout, a very small town. People gather there to look at the parade floats, have a drink and have something to eat outside on the terrace.\" During the Night Parade, the floats are illuminated, creating a magical atmosphere.\nAnd on float Construction Days (Wednesday to Friday), spectators can watch volunteers decorate the floats with thousands of flowers. On Sunday afternoon, after the parade, the floats are displayed for one last time in the city of Haarlem.\nThe Bloemencorso parade takes place each year on the third Saturday of April, marching along the road from Noordwijk to Haarlem, through the Bollenstreek and past Keukenhof. \"It's a full day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"People line up at least three four lines thick to see. Some people get their seats ready at least three hours before the parade to make sure\u2026 it's like a Disney parade. People are sitting down on the streets waiting for the parade to pass by.\"\nPanis-Ringersma's tip: watch from Noordwijk. \"Lots of people try to see the parade around Keukenhof because it passes the gardens,\" she says. \"But that's an extremely busy spot. Go to Noordwijk early in the morning. It's a beautiful seaside town.\"\nWhile waiting for the parade, feast on Dutch Stroopwafel cookies, or have lunch at Panis-Ringersma's casual Dutch dining pick, Hudson Restaurant. \"It's a very festive day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"Every town is having markets \u2026 it's an absolute must-see for people traveling to the Netherlands.\"\nWebsite: https://bloemencorso-bollenstreek.nl/en/\nPhone: +31 (0)252 428 237\nInstagram: @bloemencorsobollenstreek\n3. Best interactive experience: Visiting a tulip farm\nFor those who aren't satisfied merely admiring the blooms from afar, Panis-Ringersma suggests visiting a tulip farm. \"Because everybody really wants to go into the fields, which is not allowed,\" she says. \"So, please go to a tulip farm where it is allowed!\"\nPanis-Ringersma's three farm recommendations are all found in the heart of the Bollenstreek. \"All three are founded by bulb growers,\" she says. \"So, they know absolutely what they are doing. They're all a very hands-on experience.\"\nThe family-run Tulip Experience in Noordwijkerhout is Panis-Ringersma's first pick; home to nearly 1 million tulips. \"You can go to the field where you can see at least 700 different types of tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can visit the tulip market with all kinds of products made of tulips or with tulips on it. You can pick your own tulips. It's a very fun experience.\" What sort of tulip products? \"Beer with tulips, tulip vodka, tulip Aperol Spritz, soap smelling of tulips, vases, napkins with tulips, wallets with tulips,\" she says. \"If you can name it, everything with tulips.\"\nAlternatively, visit Tulip Barn in Hillegom just 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, where visitors can immerse themselves in the 750,000 tulips sprawling across the farm's gardens and production field. \"They are more focused on making Instagrammable photos,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"So, for a bit younger target audience.\"\nHeading further south, Panis-Ringersma also likes De Tulperij in Voorhout. \"You can go together with the bulb grower,\" she says. \"You're walking into the fields. He will dig up some tulip bulbs and will show you how they are growing and what they are doing each year to make them grow. It's a very interesting environment.\"\nWebsite: https://tulipexperienceamsterdam.nl\nAddress: Delfweg 37, 2211 VK Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands\nPhone: +31651368784\nInstagram: @tulipexperienceamsterdam\n4. Best for kids: Tulip picking\nFor visitors with antsy kids (and a car), Panis-Ringersma loves tulip picking in the Bollenstreek. \"Not in the regular fields where you can say as you're walking, 'Oh, I like this one!'\" she says. \"No, just go to a to a picking farm and pick your own tulips.\"\nTulip Road Trip Map\nWhen roaming the Bollenstreek, it's helpful to have a plan \u2013 like Panis-Ringersma's helpful tulip road trip map; perfect for navigating the area by car or by bike.\n\"The green map square is Keukenhof,\" she explains. \"All the yellow stars are flower fields. The pink line is a long route among various flower fields; the blue is a route towards the beach. And when you drive by bike or by car, you will absolutely find tulip fields in bloom regardless the time of season during springtime.\"\nThere are several picking farms in the Bollenstreek area, but Panis-Ringersma recommends heading to Annemieke's Pluktuin, a tulip nursery in Hillegom run by husband-and-wife team, Annemieke and Pieter. \"Pluktuin is literally 'picking garden',\" explains Panis-Ringersma. \"Tulip picking is an absolutely brilliant experience, especially when you go with children to walk into the field and get the tulip with the bulb and you can take the bulb and the tulip with you back home or to the hotel.\"\nWebsite: https://www.annemiekespluktuin.nl\nAddress: Haarlemmerstraat 15A, 2182 HA Hillegom, Netherlands\nPhone: +31653839979\nInstagram: @pickinggardenholland\n5. Best for tulip aficionados: Hortus Bulborum\nFor Panis-Ringersma, whose passion for tulip photography led her to become an expert in tulip horticulture, the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen is a sacred institute of learning.\nDid You Know?\n\"An interesting fact about tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's not native to the Netherlands but people think it is.\" Tulips are, in fact, native to the Himalayas, where they flourished as a small red mountain flower before being brought to Turkey in the 1400s. \"People from Turkey went to the Himalayas and took this magical flower,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They thought, 'Oh, it's very interesting. Let's see if we can make it taller or different colours.' At the end of the 16th Century, it came to the Netherlands. People would have thought, 'Okay, it's a very ugly bulb, but there comes a beautiful flower out of it.'\"\n\"It's like a living museum,\" she says. \"Tulips entered the Netherlands around the 16th Century. And people loved them from the very beginning. And right now, there is one place in the Netherlands that keep the bulbs alive from the 16th Century and later on. So, this is a place where you can visit and find the oldest bulbs of the Netherlands still blooming.\"\nThe Hortus Bulborum houses more than 4,500 varieties of historical spring bulbous plants, from tulips to daffodils to hyacinths, which are rarely cultivated in modern day. The garden's star bulbs include a specimen of Fritillaria Persica, dating to 1557, and the ancient 16th-Century tulip Duc van Tol Red and Yellow.\n\"So, you can visit and it's a very small garden,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They have great apple pie! So absolutely visit and drink some coffee with apple pie over there and have a look at all the different kinds of flowers.\"\nWebsite: https://hortus-bulborum.nl/en/\nAddress: Zuidkerkenlaan 23A, 1906 AC Limmen, Netherlands\nPhone: +31617291643\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hortusbulborum/\n\u00a0\nThis article was originally published 31 March 2024 and has been updated to reflect the 2025 opening and closing dates for Keukenhof Gardens.\u00a0\nBBC Travel's\u00a0The SpeciaList\u00a0is a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\u00a0\n--\nIf you liked this story sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of stories from BBC Future, Culture, Worklife and Travel, delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on\u00a0Facebook, or follow us on\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Travel, head over to our Facebook page or message us on X.",

        "article_text": "When Rebecca, a 48-year-old mother from Michigan, needed help for her disabled son, she turned to the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.\nRebecca's 13-year-old adopted son had foetal alcohol syndrome, ADHD, and other mental health diagnoses that required specialised educational support. His symptoms could include aggression towards peers, faculty or objects, and he received suspensions last fall following outbursts.\nRebecca said the school district isolated her son from his peers for months, with only special education teachers and limited faculty for contact.\nIn October 2024, Rebecca filed a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights alleging the school violated federal disability law and her son had been \"discriminated against and denied a free appropriate public education\". She alleged the school only allowed him to \"attend school for two hours per school day and in a 1:1 segregated setting\". Hours were gradually added back, Rebecca said, but he remained isolated. The school district did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThough Rebecca had a private lawyer and an education advocate, an OCR lawyer in the Cleveland office was facilitating mediation with the school district as soon as April.\nBut before that could happen, the Trump administration fired the Cleveland office's entire staff, including the attorney helping Rebecca's son, throwing her case - and others like it - into limbo. \n\"I don't have any other option for this kid,\" said Rebecca, who asked the BBC to withhold her last name and her son's name to protect his privacy. \"They're playing politics with my little boy. And I don't think that's fair.\"\nThe sudden firings, and ensuing confusion, were precursors of President Donald Trump's next big move: to try and dismantle the Department of Education entirely.\nOn Thursday, he signed an executive order that directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin to \"facilitate the closure\" of the department. Congress, not the president, actually holds the power to dismantle a federal agency, and the order will likely spark legal challenges. \nBut the move has left many Americans like Rebecca uncertain about their children's future.\n\nPress Secretary Karoline Leavitt told media on Thursday that while the department will not be shut down completely, what will remain will be much smaller, and will focus on \"critical functions,\" such as federal student loans.\nOCR, she said, will be greatly reduced in \"scale and the size\".\nCuts have already begun: On 11 March, the Trump administration made drastic cuts to the department using a process known as a reduction in force, halving its staff. \nMcMahon said the downsizing showed a \"commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.\"\nAlthough the Department of Education has little oversight over the day to day operations of most schools in the US, it plays a key role in enforcing federal education guidelines and policies.\nThe Office for Civil Rights was one of the hardest hit divisions in that first round of firings. The administration shuttered 7 of the 12 regional offices, including major metropolitan areas like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco. \nThis month, as Rebecca and her husband tried to figure out what the changes at the department meant for their son's case, the entire staff at OCR's Cleveland office received an email that their unit was \"being abolished\" \u2013 along with their positions.\nThe news left one Cleveland attorney who works on disability cases with a \"complete feeling of desperation.\"\nThe attorney worried not only about the individual cases still underway, they told the BBC.\n\"The effect of each individual case is sometimes much bigger, in terms of educating the school and making good for the others in the district,\" said the attorney, who requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the administration. \nParents and OCR attorneys had long been frustrated with the agency's growing backlog and diminishing staff. They fear new cuts will make it impossible for the already overwhelmed division to handle the tens of thousands of complaints it receives each year.\nTasked with making sure schools are following America's civil rights laws, the OCR's job is to help ensure that students are not discriminated against because of their disability, sex, race or religion. Remedies the office helps institute could be as straightforward as adding accessibility features to school buildings or seating a near-sighted child at the front of the class. But the office also tackles complex cases involving discrimination or bullying, as well as sexual harassment and assault.\nBefore his executive order, there were already signs that the office's mission was changing. \nOCR staff had received guidance for the office to prioritise cases involving antisemitisim, the AP reported. Craig Trainor, the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, has said they will take on cases involving transgender athletes at universities in order to combat \"radical transgender ideology\".\nOn 14 March, the Department of Education said it had launched investigations into more than 50 universities as part of the administration's move to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, which it views as exclusionary. \nStaffers who remained in their jobs said the Department of Education's new leadership had provided little to no guidance about how thousands of pending cases, including Rebecca's, would be reassigned. They also worried that cases involving racial minorities, or people with disabilities, will not receive the appropriate attention.\nThe office received a record 22,687 complaints in fiscal year 2024, according to OCR's annual report. Headcount had declined even as cases increased over the years. In 1981, OCR had 1,100 full time employees. By 2024, it was down to 588.\n\"We were already so incredibly flooded with cases,\" the Cleveland attorney said. \"I was never proud of our processing time.\"\nWith the new cuts, they said, \"this work will not be able to be done\".\nBut parents and educators say they will not let the Department of Education be shut down without a fight. Nikki Carter, a mother and disability advocate in Alabama, is one of two plaintiffs in a lawsuit brought by the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, which is suing the Department of Education, McMahon, and Trainor over the mass job cuts.\nThe lawsuit alleges that McMahon's actions have stalled Ms Carter's racial discrimination case that was being handled by the OCR and she \"has received no indication that the investigation has resumed\".\n\"There was a lack of communication throughout the entirety of the process,\" Ms Carter told the BBC. \"When the Trump administration came in, it made that situation even worse and even more difficult.\"\nDespite her frustrations with OCR, she believed the office was still necessary to help victims of racial discrimination. She hoped the lawsuit would not only restore the office, but improve it.\n\"Children, family, as well as advocates, they don't get due process,\" Ms Carter said. \"They are being denied just basic federal educational rights. And so when you can't get that on the local and state level, the only hope that we have is to turn to the federal government.\n\"We do need OCR to go back to work,\" she said. \"And we also need OCR to be accountable for their actions \u2013 or lack thereof.\"\nMeanwhile, Rebecca has transferred her son to a district school for students with emotional impairments. But she still wants OCR to negotiate special tutoring for her son, and to educate the district staff about how to help students like him. She recently learned her son's case would transfer to the still-operating Denver office, but has received no other updates.\n\"He was treated so poorly and differently because of the way his brain was structured,\" she said. \"I want to see somebody held accountable for the way he was treated.\" ",

His symptoms could include aggression towards peers, faculty or objects, and he received suspensions last fall following outbursts.Rebecca said the school district isolated her son from his peers for months, with only special education teachers and limited faculty for contact.In October 2024, Rebecca filed a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights alleging the school violated federal disability law and her son had been \"discriminated against and denied a free appropriate public education\". 'They're playing politics with my little boy': What Department of Education cuts mean for one mum3 hours agoShareSaveKayla EpsteinBBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesThe Department of Education headquarters in Washington, DCWhen Rebecca, a 48-year-old mother from Michigan, needed help for her disabled son, she turned to the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.Rebecca's 13-year-old adopted son had foetal alcohol syndrome, ADHD, and other mental health diagnoses that required specialised educational support. Staffers who remained in their jobs said the Department of Education's new leadership had provided little to no guidance about how thousands of pending cases, including Rebecca's, would be reassigned. This month, as Rebecca and her husband tried to figure out what the changes at the department meant for their son's case, the entire staff at OCR's Cleveland office received an email that their unit was \"being abolished\" \u2013 along with their positions.The news left one Cleveland attorney who works on disability cases with a \"complete feeling of desperation.",

It should have been done a long time ago,\" said Cwmtillery resident Russell Martin. \n\"Three years or more, four it's been around. We knew it could have happened. Not only that, it's deterioration of properties now.\"\nHe described sand bags being a feature of life now and concerns when there's bad weather, adding: \"If we were not of this age we wouldn't stay here.\n\"We are not moving now at 72 and 71 years of age.\"\n\"We haven't got a council house and can't just say 'you move me, I don't want to live here, I want to move from here',\" said another resident, Diane Morgan.\n\"We've put a lot of money into this [house], we still are, we've worked really hard. It's upsetting. Why should we live under this threat?\"\nShe gave a cautious welcome to the funding news, describing the \"pure carnage\" of \"two trees, massive boulders, slurry down the hill\", during Storm Bert. \nBut she also said she had sent photos to the authorities in the past following storms when rivers of water had been running down the street, saying: \"It's like we don't exist.\"\nWith more storms than ever happening, she called on the authorities to \"get your priorities right\". \nDeputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies described the Welsh government funding as \"unprecedented\", with it sitting alongside \u00a325m pledged by the UK government last October.\nWith coal tips dotted around the south Wales valleys - a legacy of the area's mining past - fears have existed for some time about the potential risks they pose.\nThese concerns were heightened in 2020, after a landslip in Tylorstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf. \nSome 60,000 tonnes of spoil material slid down the side of an old coal tip, entering a river.\nThis led to the launch of a Coal Tip Safety Taskforce between the Welsh and UK governments.\nA total of 2,573 disused coal tips were identified, with 360 classed as having \"the potential to impact public safety\" and requiring regular inspection.\nA review, commissioned by the Welsh government, found existing laws on tip safety - introduced in the wake of the Aberfan disaster in 1966 - no longer provided \"an effective management framework\", as they were designed for a time when there was an active coal industry.\nRhondda Cynon Taf has the highest number of the most risky category D tips in Wales. \nThe local authority area will receive \u00a311.49m, with Neath Port Talbot getting \u00a36.34m, Merthyr Tydfil \u00a34.2m, Caerphilly \u00a32.78m, Blaenau Gwent \u00a31.997m, Torfaen \u00a31.98m and Bridgend \u00a31.8m, in the major awards. \nWork will be carried out by local authorities, and Natural Resources Wales (NRW).\n\"These tips are a visible symbol of how coal mining shaped the valleys but many years later, the tips are still causing issues around safety and pollution which have to be addressed urgently,\" said Neath Port Talbot council leader Steve Hunt.\nNRW will get \u00a32.298m, while Wrexham will get \u00a3823,000, Cardiff \u00a3110,000 and Monmouthshire \u00a316,000. \nMr Irranca-Davies, who also has responsibility for climate change, said he hoped a Disused Mine and Quarry Tips (Wales) Bill introduced in the Senedd last December, would provide further reassurances. \n\"If passed, this ground-breaking legislation will establish a dedicated public body to safeguard against threats from tip instability,\" he said. \n\"The new authority would take full responsibility for assessment, registration, monitoring and management of these sites across Wales, helping to provide peace of mind to nearby communities.\"",

The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicians. \nThese expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident, and team members have to undergo a range of psychological assessments before travelling.\nBut on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".\nA South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".\nIncidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented.

Enough lives destroyed. Enough destruction. The guns must fall silent,\" Macron said in a post on X.\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Putin should agree to a \"full and unconditional ceasefire now\", telling MPs he had seen \"no sign\" that Putin was serious about a peace deal.\nHe warned that the UK and its allies have \"more cards that we can play\" to help force Russia to negotiate \"seriously\".\nThe White House sounded a more upbeat note on the eve of the Trump-Putin talks, which will take place by phone, saying peace in Ukraine has \"never been closer\".\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that Trump was \"determined\" to secure the peace deal.\nOn what the talks might cover, she said: \"There's a power plant that is on the border of Russia and Ukraine that was up for discussion with the Ukrainians, and he will address it in his call with Putin tomorrow.\"\nThe facility is likely to be the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It has been occupied by Russian forces since March 2022, and fears of a nuclear accident have persisted due to fighting in the area.\nAsked on Sunday what concessions were being considered in the ceasefire negotiations, Trump said: \"We'll be talking about land. We'll be talking about power plants [...] We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.\"\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on what the leaders would discuss, responding, \"we never do that\". \nWhile Putin has previously said he supports a ceasefire, he also set out a list of conditions for achieving peace.\nOne of the areas of contention is Russia's Western Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a military incursion last August and captured some territory.\nRussia had pushed to recapture it in recent weeks, and Putin now claims it is fully back in control of Kursk.\nHe has also raised numerous questions about how a ceasefire could be monitored and policed along the frontline in the east, and has said he would not accept Nato troops on the territory.\nThe peace proposal on the table was discussed by Ukrainian and American delegates in Saudi Arabia last week.\nAfter hours locked away in a room, they announced proposals for a 30-day ceasefire, which Ukraine said it was ready to accept.\nFrance's President Macron and newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who met on Tuesday, stressed their nations would continue their  \"unwavering\" support of Ukraine and demand \"clear commitments\" from Russia.

She lives with her family in Chantilly, Virginia, located in Loudoun County. \nMs Konanki was last seen early in the morning of 6 March. \nSurveillance video shows her and a group of friends walking toward the beach. \nShe was with five women and two American men in the video. \nMs Konanki stayed on the beach with one of the men as the others returned to the hotel, Dominican police told the BBC's news partner CBS.\nDominican President Luis Abinader said earlier this week during a news conference that the last person who had contact with Ms Konanki reported a wave hit them while they were on the beach. \nThe parents of the man - Joshua Riibe - last seen with Ms Konanki released a statement to CBS News saying they hope Ms Konanki is \"found as soon as possible\". \nRiibe is a senior at St Cloud State University in Minnesota. \n\"We recognise that this is a complex and painful situation for all parties involved, and we trust that the investigation will be conducted with transparency and justice. Our only interest is that due process be respected and that actions be taken with the fairness that the situation requires,\" the statement reads. \nThe Dominican Republic's national police told the BBC that they had received a request from Ms Konanki's family to declare her dead. \nOfficials have said that they have spent dozens of hours looking for the missing student. \nPolice are dividing search areas and assigning drones to certain sectors. \nPilots are monitoring footage that is being uploaded to a command centre where AI is looking to identify objects in the ocean. \nSearch crews are looking in water and on land. \nAuthorities say it's not clear whether foul play was involved in Ms Konanki's disappearance. \nThere was no blood or signs of violence found at the beach. \nThe University of Pittsburgh, where Ms Konanki is a student, said in a statement they are working with the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Homeland Security and local authorities in response to her disappearance. \nThe International Criminal Police Organization, known as Interpol, issued a global alert after Ms Konanki went missing. \nThe yellow notice is for missing persons such as victims of kidnappings or \"unexplained disappearances\".

        "article_text": "Repeated failures in how CTs, X-rays and other medical scans are being interpreted are leading to avoidable patient deaths and delays in diagnosing cancer, England's health ombudsman has warned. \nThe most common problems include doctors failing to spot abnormalities, scans being delayed or not carried out, and results not being followed up properly.\nThe ombudsman has upheld or partially upheld 45 cases which include failures in medical imaging in the last four years, and says lessons must be learned to avoid the same mistakes again. \nNHS England said staff work extremely hard to keep patients safe but acknowledged there was more to do to improve the \"response to serious health issues\".\nIn one case, medical staff at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough repeatedly failed to diagnose an 82-year-old man with bowel cancer and left him suffering prolonged pain, according to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO).\nThe man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021. \nA scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel.\nHowever, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery.\nThe patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home. \nLater that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body. \nJust months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain. \nThe ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions. \nFailings in his care \"were probably contributory factors to the patient's decision to end his life\", her report suggests. \nThe man's daughter said: \"I really tried to get the doctors to listen. \n\"I had a feeling something was wrong and I pleaded numerous times for them to keep him in the hospital, but they just kept discharging him and not doing anything to help him.\"\nA statement provided by the hospital trust says: \"We are very sorry for our failing in care in this case and we have a further meeting with the patient's family shortly to update them on the changes we have since made. \n\"This includes ensuring that older patients presenting with abdominal pain are appropriately reviewed.\"\nThe trust has also agreed to pay the family \u00a34,000, as recommended by PHSO. \nIn another investigation, the ombudsman found a cancerous tumour was incorrectly identified as benign (non-cancerous) - despite repeated scans suggesting otherwise. \nThe patient, a 54-year-old man, had his first scan in Tenerife, after becoming unwell on holiday. \nHis brother said: \"When my brother collapsed in Tenerife, the hospital immediately identified the tumour for what it was [an aggressive brain tumour] and even offered to remove it. \n\"But my brother wanted to come home, he thought the best place for him to have the treatment was in the NHS.\"\nThe man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital.\nHowever, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nHe died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous.\nIf the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said.\nWhile the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life.\nHis brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\"\nIn a statement, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We fully recognise that errors were made in this patient's care, and we apologised to his family at the time of the incident.\n\"Learning from mistakes when they occur is crucial, and we have made a number of changes as a result of this case to improve the safety and effectiveness of the care our teams provide.\"\nThe trust has agreed to pay the family \u00a33,500. \nMs Hilsenrath, whose team independently investigates complaints, said: \"Each of the cases we have investigated and upheld represent a real person whose life has been impacted by failings in care. \n\"They are also all instances where the organisations involved failed to identify that anything had gone wrong\"\nThe 2021 ombudsman report into medical imaging issues recommended system-wide improvements, but Ms Hilsenrath said while there had been some progress, she was still seeing instances where people's care was \"sub-optimal, often with devastating consequences\".\nIt is \"critical\" that action is taken to improve the digital infrastructure in the NHS and ensure people are diagnosed and treated swiftly, she added.\nDr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed digital infrastructure needed improvements. \n\"The ombudsman highlights some devastating failures in the NHS, and we must collectively learn from these experiences to drive meaningful change,\" she said. \n\"However, it must also be recognised that these findings reflect a system that is overburdened and under-resourced.\"\nThe college says it faces a 30% shortfall of clinical radiologists, which is projected to rise to 40% by 2028. \nAn NHS spokesperson said: \"The NHS had delivered a record number of tests and checks in 2024, a fifth more than pre-pandemic but we know there is more to do to improve the recognition and response of serious health issues.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with all those who have been affected by the failings highlighted in this shocking report.\"\nThe spokesperson added that they were opening more Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs), and using new technology like AI so \"all patients can receive world-class care\".\nChanges were also being introduced in cancer care, the spokesperson said, which would see 100,000 more patients who are referred receiving a diagnosis within four weeks and up to 19,000 more people starting their treatment within two months each year.",

Opposition lawmakers lit flares during the voting session on Tuesday, while demonstrators blocked a bridge in central Budapest. Human rights groups have also condemned the move.\nIt is the latest measure from Orban's government targeting Hungary's LGBTQ+ community. \nIn 2020, the country abolished its legal recognition of transgender people, and in 2021, politicians passed a law banning the depiction of homosexuality to under-18s.\nUnder the terms of the new law, it is now \"forbidden to hold an assembly in violation\" of that 2021 legislation. \nAnyone who does faces fines of up to 500 euros ($545; \u00a3420). That could include attendees and march organisers. Police are also allowed to use facial recognition technology to identify possible offenders.\nMPs also amended Hungary's right of assembly in parliament on Tuesday.\nThe law now says that only events \"respecting the right of children to proper physical, mental and moral development\" may take place.\nOpponents of Hungary's Pride marches, and of the country's LGBTQ+ community in general, have regularly, and without evidence, accused such demonstrations of being dangerous for minors.\nProtesters outside the parliament on Tuesday chanted:\"Assembly is a fundamental right\". They blocked off central Budapest's Margaret Bridge while staring down a police cordon. \nThe EU's equality commissioner Hadja Lahbib condemned the move. \"Everyone should be able to be who they are, live & love freely,\" she wrote on X. \n\"The right to gather peacefully is a fundamental right to be championed across the European Union. We stand with the LGBTQI community - in Hungary & in all Member States.\"\nThe organisers of Budapest Pride criticised the decision on social media. \"This is not child protection, this is fascism,\" they wrote.\n\"A democratic leader would never think of restricting the fundamental rights of those who disagree with him.\"\nOrganisers vowed to continue to hold their planned 30th Pride march in Budapest on 28 June.\nIn recent months Orban has launched increasing attacks on his critics and announced plans for more conservative law changes, vowing last year to \"occupy Brussels\" to protect Hungary's freedom. \nHis Fidesz party has been in office since 2010. But polls suggest that the new centre-right party Tisza is in the lead nationally ahead of next year's parliamentary election. \nTisza, which wants a more constructive relationship with the EU, shot up in popularity after Peter Magyar, a one-time Fidesz politician, broke with the ruling party in February 2024 over what he said was its poor running of Hungary.

        "article_text": "Dublin's Molly Malone statue should be protected to prevent members of the public  from \"violating\" it by groping the sculpture's breasts, a campaigner has said. \nTilly Cripwell pointed out that the bronze artwork has been groped so many times over the years that its breasts have become discoloured. \nThe 23-year-old student said she has witnessed \"disgusting behaviour\" at the statue  many times while busking beside it in recent years. \nDublin City Council has said it is considering the campaigner's call to repair the discoloured statue and raise it on to a higher plinth. \nThe council also confirmed it is in the process of asking tourist companies to deter their customers from touching the statue. \nMs Cripwell said the groping of the sculpture's breasts by passers by and some tourists \"sets a really bad example to younger generations\". \n\"It triggered me so much, I just had to put a stop to it,\" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme.\n\"The fact that this icon is immortalised in a statue but reduced to her breasts just seems so wrong.\" \nThe Molly Malone statue was erected 37 years ago in tribute to a legendary Dublin woman who sold shellfish in the streets of the Irish capital. \nIt is not clear if the character is based on a real or fictional person, but the figure of Molly Malone has come to represent part of Dublin's working class community. \nShe was also the subject of a traditional folk song, which tells the story of a fishmongers' daughter who sold cockles and mussels from a wheelbarrow.\nAccording to the colourful lyrics, Molly died of a fever but then returned as a ghost, still wheeling her wheelbarrow through the city's streets.\nMany public artworks in Dublin are popularly referred to by rhyming nicknames and for years, the Molly Malone statue was known as \"the tart with the cart\". \nThis name was in part due to suggestions that Molly Malone worked as a fishmonger by day and as a sex worker by night. \nThe statue was first erected in Dublin's Grafton Street in 1988, created by the renowned bronze sculptor, Jeanne Rynhart.\nIt was later moved to nearby St Andrews' Street to accommodate the construction of a tram line. \nMs Cripwell, who studies at Trinity College in Dublin, accepts that many people think they are doing nothing wrong because \"it's just a statue\".\nBut she said the groping annoys her because the sculpture is \"one of the few representations of women in Irish culture\".\n\"You can imagine the stag dos that come along and it's actually just disgusting behaviour, no matter what kind of object or person you're dealing with.\"\nThe statue is already on a small plinth but Ms Cripwell wants it raised higher to encourage respect and to prevent people clamouring over the statue so easily.\nShe points out that the statues of male figures in Dublin \"are all on high platforms reflecting their status\". \nThe campaigner acknowledged that she is asking for alternations to be made to an artwork that has become a Dublin landmark, but she argued change is necessary. \n\"She already been violated and that's shown in the gold discoloration on her breasts, so the original statue is not the same as it was.\"\nMs Cripwell is also lobbying for the whole sculpture to be repatinated \"so that her breasts aren't a different colour than the rest of her\". \nDublin City Council's spokeswoman told BBC News NI the request for \"repatination and securing the plinth is being considered\" and they are awaiting cost quotations.\n\"A full report will be made to the council's Strategic Policy Committee in April,\" she added. \nAn urban myth has emerged over the years which claims that touching the statue's breasts will somehow bring good luck. \nIt is a myth that has been perpetuated by some tourist companies - a practice that Ms Cripwell wants Dublin City Council to clamp down on. \nOne example of this was still visible on a Spain-based tourism website, Viabam, on Tuesday morning. \nIn a feature about the statue, the website read: \"They say that if you take a photo with her while touching her breasts, you will return to visit the city. \n\"And it seems to work, as it is one of the most sought-after and photographed monuments in Dublin.\"\nWhen contacted by BBC News NI, Viabam's spokesperson said the article was written a couple of years ago and it was \"never our intention to offend anyone\". \n\"We were totally unaware of this campaign and we have absolutely no problem in removing that information,\" they added. \nMs Cripwell said she wants tourist firms to \"actively deter\" their customers from touching the Molly Malone statue.\nBut several tourists - both male and female - were photographed by news agencies as they touched the statue during the St Patrick's Day festival on Monday. \nThe campaigner said the sculpture's \"allegedly busty dress\" was viewed as \"a green card for this behaviour\".\nShe added the practice is also popular at other European tourist sites, including at the statue of Shakespeare's Juliet in Verona.

Text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app. Listen live on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru, BBC Radio 5 Sport Extra.\nCraig Bellamy's eyes widen with excitement when he is asked about his favourite World Cup memories.\nHe launches into an impassioned monologue charting everything from Maradona's 1986 heroics to Roberto Baggio's emergence four years later and the tactical pragmatism of Brazil in 1994.\nThat tournament in the United States lit a fire in Bellamy the teenager, convincing him that he wanted to become a professional footballer.\nHe realised that ambition with a stellar playing career that included spells at Liverpool, Manchester City and Newcastle United - but he never represented his country at a major tournament.\nNext year, the World Cup returns to the United States, co-hosts along with Canada and Mexico, as Wales aim to qualify for a second time in succession.\nSo as Wales prepare for their opening qualifier at home to Kazakhstan on Saturday, would taking his country to a major tournament as head coach make up for Bellamy's inability to do so as a player?\n\"No, come on! That's going to hurt me forever,\" he says with a laugh that suggests he is not entirely joking.\n\"I want the players to qualify. Do I want to coach at a World Cup? Yeah, but is it the most important? I'm OK, trust me.\n\"Do I want the money that can come back to help us invest, to help us keep improving this game of ours? That's all I get motivated for. I need that money so we've got more pitches, we build more infrastructure.\n\"I'm going to come and go\u2026 but I want a legacy. I want to be able to say, 'in his period he did this'. The more I do, I'm always thinking this is serious, this is full-time. This is not a part-time role. People in Wales deserve that.\"\nWales name teenager Andrews, but suffer Ramsey blow\nWales men's internationals to be shown live on BBC\nBellamy's 'unrealistic' aim? To make Wales a top team\nBellamy has enjoyed an excellent start to his first senior managerial tenure.\nHe is unbeaten in his six matches to date, leading Wales to promotion to the Nations League's top division last year by winning their group, which also effectively guaranteed them at least a play-off for World Cup qualification.\nThe aim is to seal their place in the tournament automatically. After Saturday's match against Kazakhstan, Wales visit North Macedonia on Tuesday, while Belgium and Liechtenstein also lie in wait.\nWales qualified for their first World Cup in 64 years in 2022 but were desperately disappointing as they exited at the group stage in Qatar.\nBellamy has set his players the target of not only qualifying for the 2026 World Cup but giving a better account of themselves when they get there \u2013 to add their names to the pantheon of greats who have graced this hallowed competition.\n\"I remember the 1986 World Cup massively. I think the first game I remember was England against Poland and [Gary] Lineker scored a hat-trick,\" Bellamy, 45, recalls.\n\"We used to go to Spain and I had a Lineker shirt. I pulled away from that because I always wanted an Argentina one with Maradona.\n\"1990 I really enjoyed, but it wasn't a great World Cup. We saw the emergence of Roberto Baggio, but then Toto Schillaci took over like an unknown. There was also the emergence of Cameroon. I would say that was a good World Cup but the most important one for me was 1994 in the USA.\n\"It was amazing because I wanted an Italy-Brazil final. There was something about Romario. I just thought it would be his World Cup. I watched Brazil every game. They were more conservative than other Brazilian teams, but I still think they had that quality.\n\"That World Cup, at the time as a kid, I wasn't sure which way I wanted to go. Did I want to be with my friends mostly? I knew that path wasn't going to take me to being a footballer. I think spending a month watching nearly every game. It was 'give me that, I want to be a footballer'.\"\nBellamy went on to reach the top of the club game but, despite counting the likes of Ryan Giggs and Gareth Bale as international team-mates, Wales never got close to reaching a World Cup during his career.\n\"I've got to be honest, we weren't good enough to qualify,\" he says. \"I never thought we were ever a team that was going to be able to qualify. Even if we had all the luck in the world, we still didn't have enough quality, I don't feel.\"\nFortunately, Bellamy feels differently about the current squad.\n\"I see a lot more, and they proved that they've done it before. That helps because they've got experience of qualifying,\" he adds.\n\"I just want to win this group but I can't look that far ahead. I know you would love me to be able to say that but, I think if I live in the real world, it's one step at a time. It really is that because otherwise you get so overwhelmed and you can miss the point of what this is. Kazakhstan is most important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "article_text": "Eddie Jordan played the drums in a band called Eddie & The Robbers, and would often be on stage at Silverstone during the British Grand Prix weekend\nEddie Jordan, who has died aged 76, was one of the most flamboyant Formula 1 team bosses in the sport's history.\nRising to wealth and notoriety at a time when motorsport was a kind of Wild West featuring many chancers and deal-makers, Jordan's outspoken, over-the-top personality stood out.\nHe was a rogue who was sometimes loveable, sometimes dodgy, and occasionally both at the same time.\nJordan's arrival in a location would commonly be marked by hearing a Dublin accent yelling across a crowd at someone, launching an expletive-laden rant full of insults, backed by a smile. The worse it sounded, the more it was an indication of his respect for the recipient.\nIn his early days, he sold salmon out of the back of a van in the Irish capital. The fast, witty sales talk he mastered there stood him in good stead throughout a motor racing career that had its share of success but was all too often a struggle to survive.\nMany are the people whom Jordan betrayed along the way. But somehow his character flaws were largely indulged, and he was generally regarded with affection.\nEven when behaving badly, he had a warmth and humour that made it hard not to like him.\nI knew him for more than 30 years, and was often on the receiving end of one of those sweary rants.\nIn between the banter, Jordan was kind and supportive, and working with him, whether as journalist and team owner or broadcasting colleagues, was always a pleasure.\nI last saw him in September, at the announcement that Adrian Newey had signed for Aston Martin. The fact that Jordan brokered that deal while suffering from cancer speaks volumes, as does the quiet, humble, determined way he shared his diagnosis.\nChequered Flag podcast: Eddie Jordan Tribute\nEddie Jordan - pictures in the life of a Formula 1 icon\nThis video can not be played\nEddie Jordan: Former Formula 1 team boss dies aged 76\nThere was also a rock'n'roll aspect to his character. He played the drums in a band and had many associates in the music industry including John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd, and Boyzone's Shane Lynch.\nHe founded a Formula 1 team out of nothing, built it to win races, and even in one heady year challenged for the championship. But he could not survive for long in the rarefied air at the summit of the sport, and the team sank even quicker than it rose.\nOf course, when it was on its last legs and he sold it on, he made himself a fortune. He was always a canny businessman with an eye for a deal.\nPerhaps that is what attracted the eye of Bernie Ecclestone, F1's commercial boss throughout Jordan's career. Ecclestone, a former second-hand car dealer, recognised a kindred spirit and was a kind of guardian angel at times as Jordan navigated the choppy waters of being a privateer team owner.\nJordan first encountered motor racing on Guernsey, where he spent the summer of 1970 when a banking strike in Dublin meant he could not work in his job as a clerk. On his return to Ireland, he bought a kart, and won the Irish championship at his first attempt in 1971.\nHe moved up into motor racing in 1974, first into Formula Ford and then Formula 3, only to suffer a nasty accident at Mallory Park in 1976 and badly break a leg.\nIn hospital, his hair fell out. On seeing this, his mother Eileen - by all accounts, a formidable woman - procured him a wig, and demanded he wear it.\nHe never appeared without one again. Although there was the odd time in the early days when future grand prix driver Gerhard Berger, a renowned practical joker, would sneak up behind Jordan with a high-pressure air line, and blow the hairpiece off his head.\nJordan resumed his career, but by 1979 he was struggling to find money to pursue it, and he turned to team ownership.\nJordan gave Michael Schumacher his Formula 1 debut at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix\nEddie Jordan Racing achieved considerable success in F3 and F3000 through the 1980s. And he helped launch the career of many top-level drivers including Eddie Irvine, Johnny Herbert, Jean Alesi, Martin Brundle and Damon Hill.\nBy the end of the decade, he had his sights on F1. He hired engineer Gary Anderson to create the car, and he and his small team produced the Jordan 191, an elegant design now regarded as one of the most beautiful grand prix cars in history.\nDespite having two journeyman drivers in Italian veteran Andrea de Cesaris and Belgian novice Bertrand Gachot, the team immediately punched above their weight with a series of eye-catching performances. But the defining moment of the year came at the Belgian Grand Prix.\nJordan needed a replacement for Gachot, who had been sent to jail in the UK for using CS gas in an altercation with a London taxi driver. Mercedes offered him \u00a3150,000 to field their protege Michael Schumacher. The German was an immediate sensation.\nSpa-Francorchamps is regarded as one of the world's most demanding circuits, and Schumacher had never driven around it before. Yet he qualified the car seventh - four places and more than 0.7 seconds ahead of De Cesaris.\nA clutch failure on the first lap caused Schumacher's retirement, but Jordan left Spa optimistic about what could be for his team with this brilliant young driver in the cockpit.\nMichael Schumacher drives the Jordan in practice for the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix\nThe problem was, Jordan had not tied down Schumacher properly, and the rival Benetton team swooped, with a little help from Ecclestone - who knew about Jordan's financial difficulties as they navigated their first season, and wanted this obvious new star in a more successful, stable and secure environment.\nBy the next race, the Italian Grand Prix, Schumacher was a Benetton driver. McLaren boss Ron Dennis sympathised, after a fashion, with Jordan, saying to him: \"Welcome to the Piranha Club.\" The phrase has entered the lexicon, so perfect is it in summing up the ruthlessness of the F1 business environment.\nIn desperate need of a cash injection, Jordan switched from his off-the-shelf Cosworth engine to a factory deal with Yamaha for its V12 for 1992.\nBut the engine was heavy, thirsty and unreliable, and a difficult season followed before Jordan ditched the Yamaha for a privateer Hart engine.\nRubens Barrichello became a fixture in the cockpit, as the Brazilian brought a handy budget along with his obvious talent. For 1994, he was joined by Northern Ireland's Irvine, who had made a headline-grabbing debut in Japan at the end of 1993.\nIrvine's outspoken, insouciant character fitted well with the team. In Suzuka, he had un-lapped himself on race leader Ayrton Senna's McLaren while the pair battled  HIll's Williams in the wet.\nAnd Irvine's lippy dismissiveness when confronted by Senna complaining about the incident after the race led the three-time champion to punch him.\nJordan, a keen musician himself, loved the company of rock stars so relished the chance to speak to Sir Paul McCartney at the 2011 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix\nJordan earned himself a tidy packet by selling Irvine to Ferrari to join Schumacher at the end of 1995, and soon a series of dominoes started to fall that made Jordan major contenders for a while.\nJordan had taken works Peugeot engines for 1995 when they were cast off by McLaren after just one season. That helped them attract a major title sponsorship from tobacco company Benson & Hedges. Funding changed from being desperately sought to something that could be used for investment.\nFor 1997, Jordan wanted Hill, after he was dumped by Williams despite winning the world title at the end of 1996. Hill demurred, and made the error of joining Arrows instead.\nBut he did sign for 1998, replacing Giancarlo Fisichella as the team-mate of Ralf Schumacher, younger brother of Michael, with whom Hill had fought tense title battles in 1994 and 1995.\nAlong with Hill, Jordan had also secured a supply of Mugen Honda engines, more powerful and reliable than the Peugeots, and the services of highly regarded designer Mike Gascoyne.\nAfter a disappointing start, Anderson left mid-season, and the team began to gain in competitiveness.\nJordan's first F1 win came through a one-two at the 1998 Belgian Prix. Race winner Damon Hill is in the background while Ralf Schumacher appears unhappy after Jordan imposed team orders for his drivers not to battle after they took first and second positions in the race\nAt a wet Belgian Grand Prix, after Michael Schumacher crashed out in his Ferrari after colliding with David Coulthard's McLaren, the Jordan drivers found themselves running one-two, Hill in the lead. Jordan avoided a potential on-track drama by telling them to hold position, but created an off-track one.\nThe decision led to a visit from an unhappy Michael Schumacher to tell Jordan he had been unfair not to let his brother race for the win - ironic, considering the German's status as Ferrari's number one.\nFor 1999, Ralf Schumacher was tempted away by Williams, and their driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen went the other way. It became Jordan's most successful season.\nAs Hill faded into uncompetitiveness, Frentzen won two races and emerged as an unlikely title contender, but a bizarre retirement when leading the European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring ended their hopes.\nThe team had found a clever - and dubious - way to use anti-stall as launch control. But Frentzen forgot to turn off the system as he left the pits from his stop for fuel and tyres, and that triggered a safety system that cut the engine. Jordan were never to be so competitive again.\nJordan's most successful F1 season was in 1999, when Heinz-Harald Frentzen won two races and finished third in the drivers' championship\nOver the succeeding years, Anderson rejoined, drivers came and went, there were fights over engine supply, and the money began to dry up. But there was one more win - for Fisichella in the chaotically wet Brazilian Grand Prix of 2003.\nMcLaren's Kimi Raikkonen was declared the winner after a massive crash brought the race to a halt, but the officials had missed that Fischella had actually been leading at the crucial point - and the trophy was handed over at a ceremony at the following race in Imola.\nFinancial troubles worsened in 2004 and late in the year Ecclestone introduced Jordan to the Canadian businessman Alex Shnaider. Six weeks later, in January 2005, the team was sold for $60m.\nThe deal made Jordan secure for life, but on the day he signed it he was in tears in the office of commercial director Ian Phillips, who had been with the team from the start.\nFour years later, Jordan was back on the scene as an outspoken television pundit for BBC Sport, after the corporation won back the rights to F1, and he developed a reputation for being involved in breaking big stories.\nThese included Michael Schumacher's return to F1 with Mercedes in 2010, and that Lewis Hamilton was bound for the same team for 2013. \nIn truth, the Hamilton story was more collaborative than was admitted, to protect sources, and Jordan's involvement was not as singular as was presented at the time.\nJordan, pictured with presenter Suzi Perry and fellow pundit David Coulthard, worked on the BBC's F1 TV coverage from 2009 to 2015\nHe stayed on board as coverage switched to Channel 4 from 2016, albeit appearing with decreasing regularity. But, deal-maker as ever, Jordan was always working behind the scenes, and in 2024 he pulled his last master deal.\nNow acting as the manager of his friend Newey, Jordan negotiated an exit from Red Bull for F1's greatest ever designer, and a five-year deal with Aston Martin for a salary that could reach \u00a330m with add-ons and bonuses.\nThe irony was unmissable - Aston Martin is the latest iteration of the team Jordan had founded. It had passed through various name changes and owners to end up with the Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, who has built a new factory on the site Jordan had used since 1991.\nNot long after the Newey deal was sealed, Jordan revealed in December 2024 that he was being treated for aggressive prostate cancer, though that did not stop him heading a consortium which bought London Irish rugby club in early 2025.\nHe is survived by his wife Marie, and their four children, Zoe, Miki, Zak and Kyle.\nIn recent years, Jordan was the manager for former Red Bull chief technical officer Adrian Newey\nInterviewing Lewis Hamilton on the podium following the 2014 Spanish Grand Prix",

Crew members drift out of the sound stages, wearing overalls or hi-vis tabards. There has been constant film production here since the studios opened in February 2023, with the cameras rolling on Wicked before the building was even complete.\nThe noise of the mini-forklift trucks and golf buggies moving busily around the site is completely silenced as the doors shut on the 25,000sq ft (2,320sq m) Sound Stage 2.\nThe scene in Wicked for the song Dancing Through Life, with its spinning library and flying books, was filmed here.\n\"Every costume and every film set, all the props, all the special effects rigs, everything was made here in the studio,\" Tovey tells BBC London.\n\"To see the finished result on the big screen, and for it to win awards, has been the icing on the cake.\"\nWicked, which had the biggest cinema opening for a musical adaptation of a stage show, won two Academy Awards at this year's Oscars, including for Best Production Design, accepted by Londoner Nathan Crowley - plaudits that emphasise the quality of the crews working in film around London.\n\"A mile down the road is Elstree Studios; it's celebrating its 100th year this year and that just shows there are generations of crew that have grown up in this area,\" Tovey says.\nTax breaks make the Home Counties an attractive place to make film and high-end TV but there are other elements that have to come together, Tovey says.\n\"Being in the right place is crucial - for the crew base, for the supply chain, for easy access to central London and transport links - but also to have the room to build a facility of this scale.\"\nDespite the optimistic message coming from Sky Studios Elstree, it has been a punishing few years for the industry.\nThe post-Covid spending spree in high-end TV stalled - shows made in the UK saw a \u00a3598m spend last year, 22% down on 2023 - as streaming platforms cut back their budgets, while UK box office takings are still 22% below their 2019 level.\nIn 2023, the industrial action by writers in the US had some impact in the UK.

        "article_text": "At the toughest, most turbulent time of his life, the Post-Impressionist painter was supported by an unlikely soulmate, Joseph Roulin, a postman in Arles. A new exhibition explores this close friendship, and how it benefited art history.\nOn 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin.\nA rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. \"Roulin\u2026 has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,\" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as \"such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling\".\nPaying homage to this touching relationship is the exhibition\u00a0Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits, opening at the MFA Boston, USA, on 30 March, before moving on to its co-organiser, the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, in October. This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.\n\"So much of what I was hoping for with this exhibition is a human story,\" co-curator Katie Hanson (MFA Boston) tells the BBC. \"The exhibition really highlights that Roulin isn't just a model for him \u2013 this was someone with whom he developed a very deep bond of friendship.\" Van Gogh's tumultuous relationship with Gauguin, and the fallout between them that most likely precipitated the ear incident, has tended to overshadow his narrative, but Roulin offered something more constant and uncomplicated. We see this in the portraits \u2013 the open honesty with which he returns Van Gogh's stare, and the mutual respect and affection that radiate from the canvas.\nVan Gogh moved from Paris to Arles in February 1888, believing the brighter light and intense colours would better his art, and that southerners were \"more artistic\" in appearance, and ideal subjects to paint. Hanson emphasises Van Gogh's \"openness to possibility\" at this time, and his feeling, still relatable today, of being a new face in town. \"We don't have to hit on our life's work on our first try; we might also be seeking and searching for our next direction, our next place,\" she says. And it's in this spirit that Van Gogh, a newcomer with \"a big heart\", welcomed new connections.\nBefore moving into the yellow house next door, now known so well inside and out, Van Gogh rented a room above the Caf\u00e9 de la Gare. The bar was frequented by Joseph Roulin, who lived on the same street and worked at the nearby railway station supervising the loading and unloading of post. Feeling that his strength lay in portrait painting, but struggling to find people to pose for him, Van Gogh was delighted when the characterful postman, who drank a sizeable portion of his earnings at the caf\u00e9, agreed to pose for him, asking only to be paid in food and drink.\nBetween August 1888 and April 1889, Van Gogh made six portraits of Roulin, symbols of companionship and hope that contrast with the motifs of loneliness,\u00a0despair\u00a0and\u00a0impending doom\u00a0seen in some of his other works. In each, Roulin is dressed in his blue postal worker's uniform, embellished with gold buttons and braid, the word \"postes\" proudly displayed on his cap. Roulin's stubby nose and ruddy complexion, flushed with years of drinking, made him a fascinating muse for the painter, who\u00a0described him\u00a0as \"a more interesting man than many people\".\nRoulin was just 12 years older than Van Gogh, but he became a guiding light and father figure to the lonely painter \u2013 on account of Roulin's generous beard and apparent wisdom, Van Gogh nicknamed him Socrates. Born into a wealthy family, Van Gogh belonged to a very different social class from Roulin, but was taken with his \"strong peasant nature\" and forbearance when times were hard. Roulin was a proud and garrulous republican, and when Van Gogh saw him singing La Marseillaise, he noticed how painterly he was, \"like something out of Delacroix, out of Daumier\". He saw in him the spirit of the working man, describing his voice as possessing \"a distant echo of the clarion of revolutionary France\".\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Five ways to spot a fake masterpiece\n\u2022\u00a0Six Nordic paintings that help us rethink winter\n\u2022\u00a0How to transform your home with art\nThe friendship soon opened the door to four further sitters: Roulin's wife, Augustine, and their three children. We meet their 17-year-old son Armand, an apprentice blacksmith wearing the traces of his first facial hair, and appearing uneasy with the painter's attention; his younger brother, 11-year-old schoolboy Camille, described in the exhibition catalogue as \"squirming in his chair\"; and Marcelle, the couple's chubby-cheeked baby, who, Roulin writes, \"makes the whole house happy\". Each painting represents a different stage of life, and each sitter was gifted their portrait. In total, Van Gogh created 26 portraits of the Roulins, a significant output for one family, rarely seen in art history.\nVan Gogh had once hoped to be a father and husband himself, and his relationship with the Roulin family let him experience some of that joy. In a letter to Theo, he described Roulin playing with baby Marcelle: \"It was touching to see him with his children on the last day, above all with the very little one when he made her laugh and bounce on his knees and sang for her.\" Outside these walls, Van Gogh often experienced hostility from the locals, who described him as \"the redheaded madman\", and even petitioned for his confinement. By contrast, the Roulins accepted his mental illness, and their home offered a place of safety and understanding.\nThe relationship, however, was far from one-sided. This educated visitor with his unusual Dutch accent was unlike anyone Roulin had ever met, and offered \"a different kind of interaction\", explains Hanson. \"He's new in town, new to Roulin's stories and he's going to have new stories to tell.\" Roulin enjoys offering advice \u2013 on furnishing the yellow house for example \u2013 and when, in the summer of 1888, Madame Roulin returned to her home town to deliver Marcelle, Roulin, left alone, found Van Gogh welcome company.\nRoulin also got the rare opportunity to have portraits painted for free, and when, the following year, he was away for work in Marseille, it comforted him that baby Marcelle could still see his portrait hanging above her cradle. His fondness for Van Gogh shines through their correspondence. \"Continue to take good care of yourself, follow the advice of your good\u00a0Doctor\u00a0and you will see your complete recovery to the satisfaction of your relatives and your friends,\" he wrote to him from Marseille, signing off: \"Marcelle sends you a big kiss.\"\nVan Gogh's portraits placed him in the heart of the family home. In his five versions of La Berceuse, meaning both \"lullaby\" and \"the woman who rocks the cradle\", Mme Roulin held a string device, fashioned by Van Gogh, that rocked the baby's cradle beyond the canvas, permitting the pair the peace to complete the artwork. The joyful background colours \u2013 green, blue, yellow or red \u2013 vary from one family member to another. Exuberant floral backdrops, reserved for the parents, come later, conveying happiness and affection \u2013 a blooming that took place since the earlier, plainer portraits.\nArt history has also greatly benefitted from the freedom this relationship granted Van Gogh to experiment with portraiture, and to develop his own style with its delineated shapes, bold, glowing colours, and thick wavy strokes that make the forms vibrate with life. In the security of this friendship, he overturned the conventions of portrait painting, prioritising an emotional response to his subject, resolving \"not to render what I have before my eyes\" but to \"express myself forcefully\", and to paint Roulin, he told Theo, \"as I feel him\".\nHad Van Gogh not felt Roulin's unwavering support, he may not have survived the series of devastating breakdowns that began in December 1888 when he took a razor to his ear. With the care of those close to him, he lived a further 19 months, producing a staggering 70 paintings in his last 70 days, and leaving one of art history's most treasured legacies.\nLike the intimate portraits he created in Arles, the exhibition courses with optimism. \"I hope being with these works of art and exploring his creative process \u2013 and his ways of creating connection \u2013 will be a heartwarming story,\" Hanson says. Far from \"shying away from the sadness\" of this period of Van Gogh's life, she says, the exhibition bears witness to the power of supportive relationships and \"the reality that sadness and hope can coexist\".\nVan Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits is at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 30 March to 7 September 2025, and at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam from 3 October 2025 to 11 January 2026.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

He also accused the Trump administration of continuing to withhold information from the court.\nTrump hit back at the judge in a Truth Social post later on Thursday.\n\"Judge James Boasberg is doing everything in his power to usurp the Power of the Presidency,\" he wrote.\n\"He is a local, unknown Judge, a Grandstander, looking for publicity, and it cannot be for any other reason, because his \"Rulings\" are so ridiculous, and inept. SAVE AMERICA!\"\nIn another Truth Social post, Trump called for a stop to \"nationwide injunctions\" against his administration's policies, calling such court rulings \"unlawful\".\nHe also said \"our country is in very serious trouble\", urging Chief Justice Roberts and others on the Supreme Court to \"fix this toxic and unprecedented situation immediately\".\nIn the Venezuelan migrants deportation case, government lawyers submitted a six-paragraph declaration from an immigration official.\nThey also told the court they needed another day to consider whether to invoke a state secrets clause that allows federal authorities to withhold sensitive national security information in lawsuits.\nBut Judge Boasberg was not satisfied.\n\"To begin, the Government cannot proffer a regional ICE official to attest to Cabinet-level discussions of the state-secrets privilege,\" he wrote.\nThe judge initially gave a deadline of Wednesday, before extending it to Thursday. Now he has given the Trump administration until Friday morning to provide a sworn declaration from a cabinet-level official.\nJudge Boasberg will also hold a previously scheduled hearing on Friday about Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.\nThe president last weekend cited the 18th Century measure to deport more than 200 Venezuelans, alleging almost all were members of the gang Tren de Aragua.\nBut an immigration attorney working on behalf of one of the deported men told a court on Thursday that her client was a professional soccer player in Venezuela without a criminal record, CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, reported. \nThe man, Jerce Reyes Barrios, had applied for asylum to escape political persecution, his attorney argued, saying that he was falsely accused of being connected to Tren de Aragua because of a tattoo on his arm. \nThe attorney said the tattoo honoured the football team Real Madrid. \nThe flights - which Mr Barrios and others were aboard - were halted by Judge Boasberg verbally over the weekend. Any flights currently in the air were to be turned back. \nBut the White House said the planes were already in international airspace, arguing that the judge's order was therefore invalid.",

We've been to two finals, a semi-final and a quarter final,\" the goalkeeper said.\n\"It's about that next step now. We know what it takes to get there. It's about what it takes to lift the trophy, and that is what the manager has come in to do,\" Pickford said.\n\"We have got Dan Burn's first call-up which is a great achievement for him. We have got Hendo with how many caps he has got. He has got that winning mentality, what he has won at Liverpool as a player and a captain.\n\"To have those leaders around the place, the more leaders you have in the team I think the more success they will bring.\n\"They will drive training standards, they will drive standards around the place and make it a better camp for everybody.\"\nHenderson joined Ajax in January 2024 after spending less than six months at Al-Ettifaq in the Saudi Pro League.\nHe has made 38 appearances this season and Ajax are six points clear at the top of the Eredivisie.\n\"His desire to want to win and what he has won and achieved is driven by himself,\" Pickford said.\n\"He's a winner and a big leader. I think bringing Hendo back in is great for the squad.\n\"He was vice-captain for numerous years. He didn't come to the last Euros but he was vice-captain in 2018 to Harry [Kane].\n\"I think someone like Hendo, it's great. Having leaders in your group, the teams that have won have always had that experience in the side as well.\n\"I think it's a great move for us to have someone like him in the squad. What he has done, how he is still driven - whether he plays or not he is going to be the leader on the training pitch,\" Pickford added.\nEngland reached the final of Euro 2024 under previous manager Gareth Southgate where they lost to Spain, and Pickford says it is hard to know if Henderson could have helped England win their first men's trophy since 1966.\n\"We got to a final and didn't win it,\" Pickford said.\n\"Jords is a great lad and respected by all the players and the staff.\n\"I don't think we will ever know if he was a miss as we got to the final.

She received a fourth call, also from the clinic. \nThe sheriff's office noted it never reported an official date of death for her and said that initially they'd stated that Arakawa's last known activity was on 11 February. Authorities say she'd exchanged emails with a massage therapist and visited a grocery store, pharmacy and a pet store. Garage clicker data showed she returned home around 5:15 p.m. that day. \nDr Josiah Child, who leads Cloudberry Health, told the BBC that while the clinic had never treated Hackman or Arakawa, she had reached out for medical advice.\n\n\"She called and described some congestion but didn't mention any respiratory distress, shortness of breath, or chest pain,\" he said.\nArakawa initially had scheduled an appointment for 12 February but cancelled on 10 February, explaining that she needed to care for her husband, Dr Child said. \nOn the morning of 12 February, she called again seeking treatment but because no doctor-patient relationship had been established, the clinic told her she needed to be seen in person.\n\"There were a couple calls back and forth to just schedule that appointment for the afternoon, but she never showed up,\" Dr Child explained. \"Our office called back several times and never got an answer.\" \nThe couple were both found dead on 26 February.\nChief Medical Investigator Dr. Heather Jarrell stated that \"based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that [Betsy] passed away first.\"\nThe Santa Fe medical examiner determined she died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare rodent-borne respiratory disease.\nAuthorities believe Hackman died on 18 February - the date of his last recorded pacemaker activity, which showed an abnormal rhythm of atrial fibrillation.\nHis cause of death was severe heart disease, with advanced Alzheimer's disease listed as a contributing factor. Experts believe his Alzheimer's may have prevented him from realising his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.\nIf he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.\nA necropsy report also revealed that one of the couple's three dogs, which had been crated while recovering from surgery, died from starvation and dehydration.\nAs the investigation continues, representatives for Hackman and Arakawa's estate have taken legal action to block the release of body camera footage and other visual evidence from their home when their remains were discovered. \nA New Mexico judge has issued a temporary restraining order that prevents their release, with a hearing set for March 31.",

That would be a game people would want to watch.\"\nWRU should have 'fronted up' after England loss - Davies\nWhere can Welsh rugby possibly go from here?\nGeorgia have risen to 11th in World Rugby's rankings - one place above Wales, who have dropped to the lowest position in their history after 17 consecutive Test defeats.\nThe former Leicester forward's side have now won 17 second-tier titles and he says they need a greater challenge.\n\"We feel we are probably a little bit too strong for this tournament although the other teams are improving, especially Spain and Romania, but for us to improve we need to play at a tougher level,\" the 54-year-old told the BBC Radio Wales Breakfast programme.\n\"We need to go and get challenged and we need to lose games. We need to lose games to know what it feels like to play at the level the Six Nations is at, as Italy had that opportunity in the early 2000s.\n\"We feel we've earned the right, not to be given that place, we want the opportunity to prove that potentially we're good enough to compete on a regular basis at that level.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'WRU must cut a region to solve Welsh rugby crisis' - Warburton\nCockerill does however admit the prospect of a play-off in the near future is unlikely. \n\"I don't think so. If you're in the Six Nations you wouldn't want to be voting for that type of play-off, would you?\" he added. \n\"Because it might be you, and the ramifications of not being in the Six Nations, from a rugby point of view but also from a financial point of view, would be very, very difficult.\n\"It's a bit like a Championship football club getting into the Premiership isn't it? You know it would be the richest game in world rugby. \n\"That would be a game people would want to watch and the money involved and the profile involved for Georgian rugby would catapult us into a completely different sphere if we were good enough to beat whoever finishes bottom.\n\"And if we lose, well we re-group, we keep developing and we fight for the opportunity to do that again. I don't see that as an unreasonable request.\"\nFormer England hooker and forwards coach Richard Cockerill was appointed head coach of Georgia in January 2024\nCockerill was part of England's coaching staff under Eddie Jones and led the team on an interim basis when the Australian was sacked in 2022.\nCurrently in charge of both the Georgian national team and the country's leading club side Black Lion, the former Leicester forward says he is not interested in Welsh rugby vacancies.\nThe Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) are looking for a new director of rugby as well as a full-time replacement for Warren Gatland, who left the Wales head coach role during the 2025 Six Nations.\n\"I think the Welsh job would be attractive for anybody,\" said Cockerill.\n\"It's a fantastic country with fantastic history, a country that loves its rugby. \n\"But whoever comes in next has got to be given time from top to bottom to develop the players that Wales need to be competitive because I think you look at the moment at players available for Wales, are they really good enough to be competing and being competitive in the Six Nations?\n\"I think honestly, and with all respect to everybody, I just think that they haven't quite got the quality at this point.\n\"They may grow into it with a lot of young players being in and around the squad, but they're not quite good enough at the moment so whoever comes in is going to need time - and we know in professional sport the one thing you don't get... is the opportunity to build a squad and settle in and build it from the ground up, which at the moment is probably where Wales is at.\"",

        "article_text": "The White House has denied an accusation from rights groups that it flouted due process by defying a judge's order while carrying out deportations at the weekend.\nA group of 238 alleged Venezuelan gang members, plus 23 alleged members of the international MS-13 gang, were sent from the US to a prison in El Salvador. Some were removed from the country under a law not invoked since World War Two.\nThe move came despite a temporary block issued by a judge. The White House said the judge's order itself was not lawful and was issued after the group was deported.\nNeither the US government nor El Salvador has identified the detainees, or provided details of their alleged criminality or gang membership.\nAnnouncing the move on Saturday, the day after he signed it, Trump accused the gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\".\nHe cited the Alien Enemies Act - a piece of legislation that dates to 1798, which was designed to allow non-citizens to be deported in times of war or invasion. Campaigners have questioned Trump's justification.\nThe act was used to process 137 of the total of 261 people who were deported, the White House said on Monday. \nThe basis on which the other deportees were removed from the US remains unclear, and details of the group as a whole have not been disclosed.\nSeveral relatives of men believed to be among the group told the New York Times that their loved ones did not have gang ties. \nThe White House, for its part, has insisted that authorities are \"sure\" that the detainees were gang members, based on intelligence. \nThe case raises constitutional questions since, under the US system of checks and balances, government agencies are expected to comply with a federal judge's ruling.\nA hearing to ascertain more information about the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act is taking place on Monday afternoon. \nThe order to halt the deportations came from US District Judge James Boasberg on Saturday evening, who demanded a 14-day pause pending further legal arguments.\nAfter lawyers told him that planes with deportees had already taken off, the judge reportedly gave a verbal order for the flights to turn back, although that directive did not form part of his written ruling.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied the court ruling had been broken. \n\"The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" she said. \"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from US territory.\"\nThe justice department echoed Leavitt, saying the deportees had already left before the judge's ruling - which it has appealed against.\nBut a timeline of events reported by US media suggests the Trump administration appears to have had the opportunity to stop at least some of the deportations.\nTrump's border tsar, Tom Homan, told reporters at the White House on Monday that Trump did \"exactly the right thing\". \n\"The plane was already over international waters with a plane full of terrorists and significant public safety threats,\" he said. \"We removed terrorists. That should be celebrated in this country.\" \nEl Salvador's President Nayib Bukele confirmed the arrival of deportees. \"Oopsie... Too late,\" he said of the judge's order, writing on social media. His team also published footage of some of the men inside one of its mega-jails.\nAccording to the White House, El Salvador's government received $6m (\u00a34.62m) to take the detainees, which Leavitt said \"is pennies on the dollar\" compared to the cost of confining them in US prisons. \nRights groups accused Trump of using a 227-year-old law to circumvent due process.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) questioned Trump's use of a sweeping wartime authority which allows fast-track deportations. \"I think we're in very dangerous territory here in the United States with the invocation of this law,\" said Lee Gelernt from the organisation.\nThe Alien Enemies Act only allowed deportations when the US was in a declared war with that foreign government, or was being invaded, Mr Gelernt said. \"A gang is not invading,\" he told BBC News. \nThe act was last used during World War Two to intern Japanese-American civilians.\nMaking matters worse was the fact \"the administration is saying nobody can review what they're doing\", Mr Gelernt added.\nMeanwhile, Amnesty International USA said the deportations were \"yet another example of the Trump administration's racist targeting\" of Venezuelans \"based on sweeping claims of gang affiliation\".\nVenezuela itself criticised Trump, saying he \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\".\nThe latest deportations under Trump's second term are part of the president's long-running campaign against illegal immigration.  \nThe US president has also moved to strengthen ties with El Salvador.\nThe two gangs targeted with the weekend deportations were declared \"foreign terrorist organisations\" by Trump after returning to the White House in January.",

Stuart has such a low penalty count and gets through so much good work, and it's the same for Genge - the nuts and bolts of his game are superb.\"\nThe engine room in the second row remains the same, with Barclay suggesting England captain Maro Itoje is a Lions skipper in waiting.\nIn the back row, Barclay has named Jac Morgan in his side despite Wales' run of 17 consecutive defeats and a second Wooden Spoon in as many years.\nMorgan made a tournament high 88 tackles, while only Itoje arrived at more rucks on both sides of the ball.\nThe Welshman replaces Scotland's Rory Darge, who made more cleanouts than any other player (45) but Barclay says Morgan could reach greater heights in the Lions set-up.\n\"I had Rory Darge in the back row but I think he has fallen off slightly. Jac Morgan  has played in a Wales side that is struggling, but he has stood out. Imagine him with the quality of [Lions] players and that coaching structure around him.\"\nIn the backs, Barclay selected five Scotsmen, including Finn Russell at fly-half.\nCentre Sione Tuipulotu was ruled out of the tournament with a pectoral injury but Barclay has opted for his countryman, who is expected to return before the end of the season, while England's Ollie Lawrence has dropped out of contention after suffering an unfortunate Achilles rupture.\nBarclay has picked Tuipulotu at inside centre, outside Russell and inside Huw Jones in an all-Scottish midfield, with Blair Kinghorn selected at full-back and Duhan van der Merwe on the wing. \nSix plays that defined the Six Nations \nFive talking points from final round of Six Nations\nThe Six Nations review with Barclay and Warburton\nWarburton, who captained the Lions to a series victory on their last visit to Australia in 2013, has selected a team of five Englishmen, five Irishmen, three Scots and two Welshmen.\nIn total, Warburton has made eight changes in personnel from his team of round one, with Fagerson again missing out in the front row, replaced by Tadhg Furlong, who played his first Test since July in Ireland's final day victory over Italy.\nFurlong missed Ireland's first four games of the competition with a hamstring and calf issue but former Wales captain Warburton says the prop has enough \"credit in the bank\".\n\"There is a lot of rugby to be played between now and the tour,\" said Warburton.\n\"If Furlong gets five games for Leinster and three games on the tour, he rolls into a Test series with eight games under his belt. If he gets fit, I think his ceiling is higher than any other tighthead.\"\nEngland's George Martin also replaces veteran Irishman Tadhg Beirne in the second row, alongside Warburton's choice for captain Itoje, despite the Leicester Tigers forward missing England's past three matches with a knee issue.\n\"I've gone with Martin because I think physicality wins up front and he brings that grunt,\" said Warburton.\n\"He got injured against France [in round two] but I think he is the best enforcer on the home isles.\"\nLike Barclay, Warburton has also chosen a half-back pairing of Ireland's Jamison Gibson-Park and Scotland's Russell, who had some nice touches with ball in hand but crucially missed what would have been a match-winning conversion against England.\nWarburton says a returning Tuipulotu in midfield could hold the key to Russell's success Down Under.\n\"Russell has been exceptional for Bath and they have been probably been the most physical team in the Premiership this season,\" he added.\n\"It will be his third tour as well so he's vastly experienced to hold the reins at 10.\n\"If you put him outside Gibson-Park and with Tuipulotu on his shoulder, playing behind that pack, it will enhance him even more.\n\"He is the most naturally gifted 10 we have and he could go to another level again.\"\nTommy Freeman is chosen on the wing after his impressive tournament in which he became the first England player to score a try in every game of a Six Nations campaign, while Wales full-back Blair Murray is Warburton's \"curveball\" selection.\nThe New Zealand-born Welshman, is picked ahead of namesake Kinghorn, who made a tournament-leading nine line breaks alongside 575m gained and 13 offloads.\n\"Before the tournament, I was asked who the best newcomer would be and I said Blair Murray,\" said Warburton.\n\"He didn't get picked in the first game so that didn't go too well but he comes from a  great pedigree with the Canterbury Crusaders.\n\"He is an exceptional athlete, has a counter-attack ability, is good under the high ball and brave in defence. \n\"It's the toss of a coin between him and Blair Kinghorn, who has been excellent as well and got better as the tournament wore on.\"\nThis video can not be played\nItoje 'frontrunner' for Lions captaincy - Warburton\nLions watch: Kinghorn & Chessum star but Lawrence injury blow ",

        "article_text": "Debra Eichenbaum had not thought about the measles virus for 20 years when she got her two young children vaccinated against the highly contagious disease.\nBut then cases across the US began to climb this year, and the 62-year-old worried about how best to protect her husband, David, who is immunocompromised after surviving pancreatic cancer.\nSo she got another measles shot, and emailed friends her age, encouraging them to check with their doctors to make sure they were still immunised.\n\"There's no downside to it,\" she said. \"For me, that was a no-brainer.\"\nMs Eichenbaum is just one adult who debated an extra shot when cases spiked across the US. Others are thinking about their children, who may not yet have been immunised against the virus.\n\"There is a lot of confusion out there right now, especially in light of differences in how different age groups of the population have been vaccinated based on what the recommendations were at the time of their vaccination,\" said Donald Dumford III, an infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic.\nThe US declared it had eliminated measles from the country in 2000, after decades of access to a safe and effective vaccine. But since the Covid-19 pandemic and an increase in vaccine scepticism, the number of measles outbreaks has risen.\nThere have been over 300 cases in 2025 across more than a dozen states. This year, the US saw the first measles death in a decade: a 6-year-old girl in western Texas, the epicentre of an outbreak that has spread to neighbouring New Mexico and Oklahoma.\nMeasles is a dangerous virus that has no cure and can lead to a host of complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. It can be deadly. \nVaccination rates must be 95% or higher for the broader population to be protected, but several communities where the virus is spreading have rates well below that. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases that exists, spreading very easily if people are unprotected, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nHealth Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine-sceptic, has sent mixed messages about the outbreak, at times encouraging people to talk to their doctor about vaccines, and at other moments, promoting alternative treatments not recommended by public health experts.\nThe federal government has not offered any guidance about whether certain adults should talk to their doctor about getting another shot - or whether parents in hotspots should consider getting their young children vaccinated sooner.\nAsked for comment, the US Department of Health and Human Services referred the BBC to existing measles vaccine guidance from the CDC.\nMs Eichenbaum decided on another measles vaccine over concerns that some people vaccinated in the 1960s may have received a less effective dose. \nThose vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 may have received what is known as an inactivated measles vaccine, and should consider getting an additional shot, said Melissa Stockwell, a professor of paediatrics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\nThose who are unsure about their vaccination status can either search for their written vaccination records or have their antibody levels checked with a blood test, doctors say.\nAdults born earlier than 1957 likely had measles as a child and are considered immune, Dr Stockwell said.\n\"The recommendation is that anyone who does not have presumptive immunity should be vaccinated,\" she said.\nFor weeks before his new baby was born, Kyle Rable and his pregnant wife exchanged anxious messages throughout the day, wondering how they could best keep their future son safe from measles.\n\"It's basically both of our constant thoughts all the time,\" said Mr Rable, whose wife gave birth to their son, Steven, earlier this month in the same hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where a child died of measles just a week before.\nThe outbreak in western Texas has raised the alarm for parents across the state and in the wider region, especially those who have young babies who cannot yet be immunised.\nThe measles vaccine is not generally recommended for children who are under a year old because the shots do not work as well before that age, doctors say. \nIt is a two-dose vaccine. Typically, children are given their first shot between the ages of 12 and 15 months, and then another between ages 4 and 6.\nBut for young children who live near a measles outbreak, paediatricians may recommend a shot at an earlier age, between six and 11 months, said Stuart Ray, professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nMr Rable plans to ask about vaccination plans at his son's two-week checkup, and will \"100%\" vaccinate his child early if the doctor recommends it.\nChildren vaccinated before they are a year old still need two additional standard doses of the measles vaccine later on, Dr Ray said.\n\"There's no harm in getting the additional doses,\" said Tony Moody, a paediatrics professor at Duke University School of Medicine. \"The decision about getting an early MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) should be a conversation between the family and their paediatrician.\"\nChildren can get a second dose as soon as 28 days after their first shot.\n\"The vaccine starts providing some protection within weeks of the first dose,\" Dr Ray said.\nParents hoping to get their children vaccinated against measles, or adults looking for another dose, can make an appointment at a pharmacy. \nHowever, some pharmacies - especially in Texas, the epicentre of the outbreak - have seen vaccine shortages because of higher demand.  \nThe CDC has provided thousands of doses to the state. \nLocal health departments in western Texas also are holding vaccination clinics, while many across the US offer the shot free of charge.

        "article_text": "Rory McIlroy is the first European to win the Players Championship more than once\nRory McIlroy woke early, far too early. It was 03:00 on Monday morning and his stomach was already starting to churn. He was three holes away from winning a second Players Championship and he felt the trophy should already be his.\nWould this prove another big victory to elude him? The world number 57, JJ Spaun, stood between him and one of the most coveted crowns in the game.\nAs it turned out, the 35-year-old Northern Irishman was going to be able to celebrate this St Patrick's Day in style. McIlroy channelled his nerves while his American opponent faltered - his hopes drowning when he overshot the island green 17th, the second of the three play-off holes.\nIt sets up McIlroy perfectly for his latest tilt at completing the career Grand Slam of major titles when he goes to Augusta for next month's Masters. That's where the chat is going - will he do it and finally, at long, long last don the famous Green Jacket?\n\"I feel like I'm a better player now than I ever have been,\" he said. \"I feel like I can play all conditions and in anything that comes my way.\"\nMcIlroy beats Spaun in play-off to win Players\nMcIlroy defeats Spaun in play-off to win second Players title - shot by shot\n'Slow progress & slow play lead PGA Tour's agenda'\nThis video can not be played\nIt's the most nervous I've been in a long time - McIlroy\nFirst he must celebrate this win. It was achieved without his very best golf.\nIt would be an exaggeration to say he won it ugly, but he did it with a largely errant driver and was able to put himself in contention in a way that was beyond golf's other leading lights.\nSawgrass is a capricious test at the best of times. Throw in the fierce gusting winds of Saturday, Sunday's four-hour storm delay and the cold breeze of the extra morning, which blew from a completely different direction, and it is the toughest of propositions.\nIt had already been too much for defending champion Scottie Scheffler, likewise Open and US PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, who only scraped into the weekend. It was too much too for Ludwig Aberg, who missed the cut.\nMcIlroy held it together, coming from four behind on the final day to lead by three before being caught by Spaun to force a play-off for which Sunday evening did not hold sufficient daylight.\nYes McIlroy was nervous on Monday. As nervous as he has ever been over a tee shot when the play-off began - but he did not show it. Instead, he striped a majestic drive to tell Spaun unequivocally who was the boss for this shootout.\nThere is an encouraging pragmatism about McIlroy these days. Deciding to abandon erratic new woods three rounds into the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week was an important change of mind.\nThe $1,000 taxi fare to ferry his old woods from his West Palm Beach mansion was money very well spent as he went back to his old set-up for Sawgrass, home of the biggest tournament of the year so far.\nAnd then before the play-off, McIlroy changed his hitting angles to rehearse the nine-iron shot into the wind that he would need for the pivotal second hole of the play-off.\nExperience told in both instances, just as it did when he abandoned big hitting for the final hole at Pebble Beach in February to secure his first PGA Tour title of 2025.\nAnd then came his honest admission of the nerves he was feeling. It is as though he was embracing them rather than allowing them to be the sort of demon that derailed him when he held a winning position at last year's US Open.\n\"I woke up at 03:00 this morning and couldn't get back to sleep,\" he told reporters. \"I was as nervous as I can remember.\"\nWhich is why the opening drive of the play-off was so important. He needed to go out and get the victory.\n\"If you play to win and you've hit an aggressive shot and you've hit a really good shot, I think that can relax you and it can calm your nervous system,\" he said.\n\"If you're playing sort of 'guidey' golf and just trying to not lose, I don't think that sort of golf calms you down.\"\nMcIlroy revealed he felt a turning point after painfully losing last year's Irish Open.  The following week he charged into a play-off at Wentworth and although he lost it to Billy Horschel's eagle in the BMW PGA shoot out there was hope.\nThen he went to the Middle East and ended his season with a crucial victory in the DP World Tour Championship. \"I feel that period, October, November, was a pretty important one,\" he said.\n\"And I was able to do some good work on my swing and then test it out pretty much straight after in a couple of tournaments, and I feel like that's carried into this year.\n\"It doesn't feel like I'm making those mistakes at the critical times like I was previously. I think a big part of that was just learning from those mistakes.\"\nAnd so to carry the momentum to Georgia next month. There will be a stop in Texas prior to the Masters, but already none of his big rivals can boast such an impressive form line heading into the year's first major.\n\"It's about doubling down and working on the things I've been working on,\" McIlroy told BBC Sport. \"And to make sure that I'm 100% ready to go for Augusta.\"",

        "article_text": "As polar tourism surges, experts warn of its environmental impact. From transport choices to local food, here's how to visit responsibly while protecting fragile ecosystems.\nI first learned of Greenland's existence from a world map pinned on my childhood bedroom wall. Decades later, I finally made it to the capital, Nuuk. I'd long been fascinated by pictures of the brightly coloured wooden houses lining its rocky shores \u2013 red, yellow, green and blue against an icy backdrop. Small icebergs floated just offshore and the absence of trees gave a stark, otherworldly feel. I looked forward to experiencing the crisp, biting air, exploring Inuit art at the Nuuk Kunstmuseum and maybe, if I was lucky, spotting some seals or a passing whale.\u00a0\nI'm not the only one entranced by Greenland's icy beauty: between 2018-2023, tourism to the country grew by 46%, with 131,767 visitors arriving in 2023. Much of this surge is due to the increasing number of cruise ships navigating Arctic waters.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to the Arctic Council, ships entering the Arctic Polar Code area \u00a0\u2013 a regulated maritime zone around the North Pole \u2013 increased by 37% between 2013 and 2024. Many cruise operators, like Hurtigruten, Swan Hellenic and Ponant, offer routes encompassing Iceland, Svalbard and Greenland, with the latter expecting visitor numbers to keep growing thanks to a 2024 airport expansion in Nuuk and two more international airports set to be built by 2026.\nMeanwhile on the opposite side of the planet, Antarctica is seeing a similar tourism boom. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reports a steady rise in visitors since the 1990s. In the 2022-23 season, 104,897 people visited the continent, rising to 124,262 last year. More than 80,000 of those set foot on Antarctic land \u2013\u00a0an alarming statistic for conservationists who warn that human presence can disrupt fragile ecosystems, alter animal behaviour and unwittingly bring invasive foreign organisms with them.\nAs tourism to the poles increases, organisations like the Arctic Council, the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO) and Visit Greenland stress the urgent need to balance economic benefits with environmental responsibility. The lure of the polar regions is undeniable: the near lunar landscapes; the intensity of the blue sky on a freezing, sunny day; the thrill of fresh snow crunching underfoot; and the unique wildlife that calls these places home.\nJames Grecian, a marine ecologist at Durham University, UK, and scientist-in-residence at climate advocacy nonprofit Arctic Basecamp, has spent years studying polar wildlife. Last year, he was in Antarctica studying snow petrels \u2013\u00a0or more specifically, their vomit.\nThoughtful Travel\nWant to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.\nSnow petrels' stomach oil deposits freeze into solid lumps that contain, when analysed in a lab, data on how their diet has changed over the years, and in turn, what that means about the local ecosystem. \"We can tell a lot about past conditions by taking samples from the environment, or from animals,\" Grecian explains. \"For example, the baleen plates of whales can be taken from dead animals, and the chemical signatures will tell you something about the environmental conditions or what the animal was eating.\"\nAs a fairly frequent polar visitor, he understands the appeal of these environments \u2013 and also the impact. He notes there are choices we can make to reduce the damage to these vital but threatened regions. Polar tourism is showing no signs of slowing down, but Grecian hopes that, with increased awareness of its drawbacks, visitors can make the most ethical choices possible. Here are his suggestions on how to do that.\nFirst of all, you'll need to weigh up your travel options to reach the polar region of your choice.\nThe problem with a cruise ship is that you're bringing the hotel and all the services with you,\" he says. \"I've heard stories of towns being quite unhappy about the disruption when lots of people disembark. They get all their meals catered on the ship so they won't go to the local cafes. Contrast that to planes \u2013 if you fly into an area, you're going to be staying in local hotels, you're going to be using local tour operators. The communities have a chance to benefit economically. But you need to offset that against the massive carbon emissions of planes.\"\u00a0\nWhile ships may seem a greener alternative to flying, global data suggests otherwise. Aviation accounts for 2.5% of CO2 emissions globally, while shipping contributes slightly more at 3% (although most of that is from cargo ships). There's also the noise pollution issue \u2013\u00a0the hum of ships' engines has been shown\u00a0to disrupt whales' echolocation ability.\n\"There's a horrible video \u2013 an animation based on real blue whale migration tracking, and it's a blue whale caught in shipping lanes,\" says Grecian. \"It's like a pinball in a machine; it keeps turning around and turning back because of the amount of noise that the ships produce.\"\nSo what's the alternative?\u00a0\n\"Using trains is about a 90% or 95% reduction in CO2, so from a climate perspective, a train to Norway for the fjords is a better option.\" It is possible \u2013\u00a0but takes much longer \u2013\u00a0to reach parts of the Arctic by train, even if flights are required for some of the journey. There's direct trains to Narvik in the Norwegian Arctic from Stockholm; from Trondheim to Bod\u00f8 in Norway or from Helsinki to Rovaniemi in the north of Finland.\nOr you could \u2013\u00a0if you have the money \u2013\u00a0charter a small sailing boat. \"I know people in the Falklands who sail to Antarctica fairly regularly,\" says Grecian. \"The cost of [a private charter] probably wouldn't be far off the cost of a berth on a fancy cruise ship.\"\nPolar wildlife is a big draw for visitors, but Grecian cautions against disturbing the very animals people come to see.\u00a0\n\"You must be appreciative of being a guest in that environment and try to treat it with as much respect as you can,\" says Grecian. \"There can be a tendency these days to try and get selfies with animals and that can cause a lot of disturbance. They're not used to seeing people, so give them space. You shouldn't be trying to chase them down.\"\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Will you be going on holiday to\u2026 Greenland next year?\n\u2022\u00a0Antarctic tourism: Should we just say no?\n\u2022\u00a0Could airships be the next cruise ships?\nGrecian recommends patience. \"If you sit quietly, some animals are quite curious. I haven't seen penguins in Antarctica but I have in the Falklands, and they came within 3-4m (10-13ft). So if you're quiet and still, you might get a visitor.\"\nLocal guides can also provide essential knowledge \u2013 plus Grecian says that sometimes it's about noticing the small things. \"Some people say you should always look up, but if you look down, you can see signs of animals. You might see footprints in the mud, or scat that will give you a suggestion of what animals might have passed through.\"\nThat might sound drastic, but if you're visiting on land rather than on a cruise, there is a good reason to eat local products. Transporting supplies to these remote areas carries a significant carbon footprint \u2013 globally, food production contributes three billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually.\n\u00a0In Greenland and parts of Arctic Canada, many Inuit communities still\u00a0subsistence hunt. Their hunting rights are legally protected in Canada and in Greenland, and are regulated to prevent over-hunting. \"The rights of the Indigenous population to pursue traditional hunting practices is enshrined in law,\" says Grecian. \"The meat of a ring seal or a harp seal in Greenland will have a much lower carbon footprint than imported meat or non-native crops.\"\nOf course, your personal comfort levels at the idea of eating seal meat are yours to decide, but bear in mind that if you're visiting a majority-Inuit region like Greenland, the alternatives are limited and local meat is the more environmentally-friendly option \u2013\u00a0a study comparing the carbon footprint of imported meat and local seal in Greenland found seal had the lowest footprint compared to pork and poultry.\nFor the intrepid travellers planning on camping or venturing off the beaten track, it's vital to have the right gear \u2013\u00a0and not just the obvious things like base layers, shoe spikes and waterproofs.\n\"If you're going somewhere particularly cold or out camping in more remote parts, you can hire gear in the country,\" says Grecian. Not only will it make your suitcase lighter; it'll benefit the local economy.\"\nBut when it comes to packing for your visit, Grecian offers tips on some practical but often forgotten items. \"Nasal spray,\" he says. \"Cold environments tend to be dry, so the inside of your nose can dry out and can bleed.\" And don't underestimate the strength of polar Sun \u2013 Grecian recommends taking factor 50 sunscreen. If you're camping or in other basic, remote accommodation, you might want some creature comforts, too: \"On an expedition, coffee is vital for me. On my last trip I took a moka pot and a French press!\"\nGrecian laughs when I tell him that, on my visit to Greenland, I didn't see a single whale. I went in October \u2013\u00a0the start of winter, just as humpback whales begin their migration to the Caribbean.\n\"If there's a specific activity or animal you want, look up their migration patterns,\" he says. And if it's a natural phenomenon, check when it occurs. \"For instance, a lot of people go to Newfoundland in May or June [to see] grass and flowers against the backdrop of icebergs. If you want to see that you have to go at that specific time of year.\"\nHis advice underscores a broader idea: polar travel should be guided by what's best for the natural world, not just what looks good on social media.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "To protect crops from rising droughts, scientists are looking to the genes of a small group of plants that can survive months of drought then regreen within hours.\nIt was as a child growing up in South Africa in the 1970s that Jill Farrant first noticed several plants around her apparently coming back from the dead.\nThese plants, she later learned, can survive six months or more without water. Their leaves turn brown and brittle to the touch but, given water, they will regreen within hours. Within a day, they've returned to their former self and can continue to photosynthesise.\nWhile such a Lazarus-like ability is common among mosses, ferns and other non-flowering plants, these \"resurrection plants\" belonged to the angiosperms, or flowering plants, the group that includes every blossoming tree and fruit-bearing, seed-carrying crop. But out of the 352,000 known species of flowering plants only 240 are resurrection plants. Scattered across this branch of the tree of life, they are often unrelated, each having independently evolved the ability to live without water. Primarily found growing on the rocky slopes or gravelly soils of South Africa, Australia and South America, the tactics used for this zombie-like trick are surprisingly similar \u2013 almost as if an ancestral toolkit can be retrieved from deep inside their DNA to deal with the problem of drought.\nFarrant, now a professor of desiccation tolerance at the University of Cape Town, has been studying these unusual plants for over three decades. Along with several other researchers, she believes the drought-resistant powers found in their genes may be key to adapting agriculture to a future of climate change.\nFor plants to survive for months without water may seem like science-fiction. The vast majority of plants do indeed die when they experience water loss of 10-30%. But resurrection plants are able to tolerate over 95% water loss.\nBut it's not just the ability to survive drought that is important for these species, says Carlos Messina, a maize scientist at the University of Florida. It's also how resurrection plants regrow following drought.\nMaize plants might also survive after a drought, he says, \"but when they rehydrate, they don't go back to the same leaf architecture they had before, and the flow of CO2 and water is all messed up\". Drought therefore compromises their growth long after the rains have returned.\nBut resurrection plants \"seem to come back to the form that they had before the drought,\" he says. \"If we can create maize that does that, that's fantastic, because we can regain that productivity.\"\nResurrection plants have evolved this essential skill by replacing disappearing water with sugars such as sucrose, turning the inside of their cells into a viscous, glass-like substance that slows down any chemical reactions. Known as vitrification, the same tactic is used by desiccation-tolerant animals such as tardigrades (also known as water bears) and the eggs of Artemia shrimp (sea monkeys).\nAs they turn to glass, these plants also deconstruct their photosynthetic machinery (such as chloroplasts), switching off their primary source of food as they turn to a state of dormancy. To hold their assembly of proteins and cell membranes together, they secrete a suite of protective proteins known as \"chaperones\", since they guide the cell through dangerous times.\u00a0\n\"How they preserve their tissue is quite a miracle,\" Farrant says.\nIn a sense, the abilities of resurrection plants are not so different to the seeds of most flowering plants. When dried and stored in a dark and cold place, many seeds can survive for years, sometimes millennia, preserving the recipe to make a new plant when warmth and water return.\nHype Metre\nThe fascinating ability of resurrection plants to survive intact without water for months has obvious appeal in a world seeing rising desertification and increasingly erratic drought. If these same traits could be used in crops, it could help maintain food production in areas which are drying up. But altering the genomes of organisms remains controversial in remains in many areas of the world. It's also early days for this research, although genes from resurrection plants have been shown to improve drought tolerance in some food crops.\n\u00a0\nBut once the first green shoot emerges, this \"desiccation tolerance\" is lost, traded for faster growth, high yield and more nutritious fruit or seeds. It's a trait that the green revolution, the 20th Century agriculture boom which introduced high-yielding varieties of crops grown in optimum conditions of water, soil and Sun, exacerbated.\nMeanwhile, while droughts have always been an issue for farmers, rising global temperatures due to ongoing greenhouse gas emissions are making them far worse, especially in the Mediterranean and western North America. Drought, wildfires and heat are estimated to have cost $16.6bn (\u00a312.9m) in crop losses in the US alone in 2023. According to some climate models, by 2100 much of the agricultural land in sub-Saharan Africa and South America will be unsuitable for food production, a large proportion made barren by drought.\n\"Agriculture will only be possible in Canada and Siberia,\" says Henk Hilhorst, a retired seed scientist based in the Netherlands. It is these northerly regions of the planet, not the tropics, that will have to feed the world.\nThe situation is so severe, argues Farrant, that even the most radical shifts in agriculture now have to be considered. \"We're just not going to get enough food,\" she says. \"So we've got to become incredibly inventive.\"\nThe most common crop plants such as wheat, maize and soybean have already been made more resilient to water scarcity through selective breeding. Choosing plants with greater root depth helps them find deeper reserves of water, for example, or choosing those that flower faster helps produce seeds in a shorter growing season.\nBut extreme weather events aren't just becoming more common, they are becoming more unpredictable. Chaos is the marker of climate change, says Timothy George, a soil scientist at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland. \"There's just much more variability.\" Periods without water occurring out of the blue \u2013 known as flash droughts \u2013 are becoming more common, as are droughts that occur during months of the year once guaranteed rain and mild conditions.\u00a0\nThis means that avoiding drought may stop being possible. That's why Farrant and other scientists are investigating whether they can find a way to recreate the remarkable desiccation tolerance of resurrection plants in ordinary food crops.\nTo introduce such talents to rice, maize and wheat was long thought to require the use of \"transgenic\" genetic modification \u2013 introducing DNA into their genome from distant relatives in the plant kingdom. The genes involved in desiccation tolerance would be isolated and inserted into drought-sensitive crops, a task that has been made simpler with the recent rise of Crispr gene editing technologies.\nBut Farrant's recent studies suggest that many of the genes used to survive desiccation are the same as those found in seeds of most flowering plants. To create drought-resistant crops, therefore, might not require any new genes at all; by activating the same genetic toolkit found in their seeds, a mature plant might be made more resilient to drying out. As this would involve activating genes that have simply been silenced upon germination, rather than inserting foreign genes from other plants, it may not be as controversial as some other genetically-modified crops.\nJulia Buitink, a seed biologist at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research in Paris, agrees it's a feasible approach, even if the effect were limited to the young seedlings of the crop. Seedlings could be an easier target, she says, primarily because this stage of growth follows germination, and extending desiccation tolerance would be the most logical first step. Plus, because most desiccation-tolerant organisms are small, these seedlings would fit the mould already found in nature.\u00a0\nStill, while these techniques are feasible in any laboratory in the world, there remain huge gaps in our knowledge when it comes to how these plants survive desiccation, especially when it comes to howeach adaptation is controlled. \"I think we know the main genes,\" says Buitink. \"The problem is the higher level \u2013 how can we switch them on when there is drought? And for that we really don't know much about it.\"\nThe genetic switches that have been identified, Buitink adds, are often not specific to one thing: turn on desiccation tolerance, she says, and you will almost certainly change many other parts of the plant \u2013 and most importantly, may decrease its yield. \"Which, for crops, is exactly what you don't want.\"\nBut if a \"master switch\" \u2013 a gene specific to inducing desiccation tolerance \u2013 can be found, it could be turned on only when water scarcity becomes an issue, ensuring that the yield of these crops would be unaffected if conditions are conducive to growth. Just as a resurrection plant only shrivels into a crinkle of brown leaves during the long dry season, a crop plant might only batten down the hatches when a flash drought comes out of the blue.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The $1m cactus heist that led to a smuggler's downfall\n\u2022 The strangest new species of 2024\n\u2022 The weird biology of the giant smelly 'corpse plant'\nThis is exactly what researchers in Kenya and Sweden achieved in 2018 when they introduced a single gene from Xerophyta viscosa \u2013 a resurrection plant also known as the small black-stick lily \u2013 into a variety of sweet potato. Known to be important in antioxidant defence, the gene, known as XvAld1, made these transgenic potato plants more resilient to a 12-day dehydration experiment. Compared to their wild-type neighbours, they remained greener for longer, lost fewer leaves, and grew taller even when deprived of water. Importantly, they were indistinguishable before the dehydration experiment began, suggesting the gene had no impact on growth or leaf structure.\nGenes from resurrection plants have been shown to improve drought tolerance in other plants too, including the lab favourite Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco plants. Still, with genetically-modified crops of any kind still required to fit stringent legal check-lists (particularly in the EU), Farrant has started to look for other ways to induce these remarkable traits of resurrection plants into crops grown today.\nJust as the microbiome is a hot topic in human health, the root microbiome (or rhizosphere) is gaining interest in agricultural science. Drought tolerance might not be just in the leaves and stems, but in the roots. \"This is where there might be [potential] for groups like resurrection plants or other extreme species,\" says George. \"If there's a microbiome element to their ability to cope with extreme stress, then you might be able to transfer that into a cropping system much more easily than, say, genetic components.\"\nAnd this is exactly what Farrant is trying to do. Along with her colleagues Shandry Tebele and Rose Marks, she has begun to map the microbiome of the Myrothamnus flabellifolia, a species that is unique even among resurrection plants. Growing in gravelly soil in South Africa, it can grow to waist-height and is more like a bush than a lonely patch of grass. Even with such complexity and size, it can survive for nine months or more without water.\nThe researchers first survey of M. flabellifolia's rhizosphere, published in 2024, revealed over 900 unique bacterial and fungal groups, the beginning of what might become a drought-tolerant probiotic that can be used for other plants.\u00a0\nAboveground, though, it is Farrant's work on teff that may be most auspicious. A naturally gluten-free cereal, teff has been grown for thousands of years in Ethiopia. Its tolerance to water scarcity has long led to it being lauded as a potential more sustainable and climate-resilient crop, but Farrant is interested in this species for slightly different reasons. Teff is the only crop that has a resurrection plant as a close relative: Eragrostis nindensis, a waist-height grass that grows on rocky slopes across southern Africa. Learning how these plants differ in their responses to drought might reveal which genes have been lost or switched off \u2013 and whether these can be reinserted back into teff, a genetic modification that is more likely to be successful given their close relationship.\nIt's a work still in its infancy. But already it seems that protection against sunlight is one of the main differences between the two. E. nindensi produces antioxidants inside its leaves and a coating of anthocyanins \u2013 essentially a plant's version of sun cream \u2013 on its external surfaces. Teff doesn't have this ability. It's a delicate balance for E. nindensi to pull off: sunlight is essential for a water-filled plant to grow, but during drought it can be lethal, leading to uncontrolled photosynthesis, the production of reactive oxygen species, and damage from UV radiation. For teff to have this option, however, might allow it to survive the harshest drought and grow another day.\nSo the tiny seeds of teff, milled to make flour for bread and pancakes, might just hold the key to a more sustainable agriculture. Just as maize, rice and wheat were bred for higher yields at the expense of resilience in the 20th Century's Green Revolution, such crops would add resilience, even if at the cost of a slightly lower yield. \"They might have a low yield but the subsistence farmer has a crop,\" Farrant. \"This is regardless of whether it rains in 10 days or two years.\"\n* Alex Riley is science writer and author of\u00a0Super Natural: How Life Thrives in Impossible Places.

That vote is set for Friday.\nFriedrich Merz, the man behind these plans and who is expected to soon be confirmed as Germany's new chancellor, told the lower house during Tuesday's debate that the country had \"felt a false sense of security\" for the past decade.\n\"The decision we are taking today... can be nothing less than the first major step towards a new European defence community,\" he said, adding that it includes countries that are \"not members of the European Union\".\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the vote \"excellent news\".\nSpeaking at a press conference with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, she said the vote \"sends a very clear message to Europe that Germany is determined to invest massively in defence\".\nFrederiksen meanwhile called it \"fantastic news for all Europeans\".\nGermany has long been cautious about defence spending, not just for historical reasons dating back to 1945, but also due to the global debt crisis of 2009.\nBut despite fears the vote would be tight, lawmakers in the end voted in favour of the changes by 513 to 207 - comfortably over the two-thirds majority required.\nOne leading German newspaper described this vote as \"A day of destiny for our nation\".\nUnder the measure, any spending on defence that amounts to more than 1% of Germany's GDP would no longer be subject to a limit on borrowing. Until now, this debt brake has been fixed at 0.35% of GDP.\nThe change could transform the country's partially neglected armed forces in an era of great uncertainty for Europe.\nAnd this vote was not just about defence. It was also about freeing up \u20ac500bn for German infrastructure - fixing things like bridges and roads, but also to pay for climate change measures, something the Green Party insisted on.\nMerz, whose CDU party won Germany's general election last month, proposed the measures swiftly after the win.\nIn an interview on Sunday he specifically mentioned fears that the US could pull back from defending Europe and Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that the \"situation has worsened in recent weeks\".\n\"That is why we have to act fast,\" Merz told public broadcaster ARD.\nIt is a significant political win for Merz, who will, when he takes power as chancellor, now have access to hundreds of billions of euros to invest in the state - what some in Germany have called a \"fiscal bazooka\".\nIt is also an important moment for Ukraine. The defence plans approved today by the Bundestag also allow spending on aid for states \"attacked in violation of international law\" to be exempt from the debt brake.\nThat will enable outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz to release \u20ac3bn in aid to Ukraine as early as next week.\nMerz chose to push the changes through the old parliament, knowing the vote arithmetic was more favourable now than it would be after 25 March, when the new parliament session begins.\nThe far-right AFD and far-left Linke, which both performed well in February's election, oppose Merz's plans.\nMerz has still not agreed a coalition deal to govern Germany after his election win, and has announced ambitious plans to have a government in place by Easter.\nCoalition negotiations in Germany, however, can drag on for months at a time.",

        "article_text": "When Storm Babet hit the town of Trowell in Nottingham in 2023, Claire Sneddon felt confident her home would not be affected.\nAfter all, when she bought the property in 2021, she was told by the estate agent that a previous flood the year before, which had reached but not effected the property, was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that flooding measures to protect the properties on the cul-de-sac would be put in place.\nHowever, when Storm Babet tore through the UK two years later, Ms Sneddon's home flooded after several days of rain.\n\"We knew there would be water on the cul-de-sac but no one expected it to flood internally again. However, water entered the property for five hours,\" she says.\n\"It reached to the top of the skirting boards. We had to have all the flooring, woodwork and lower kitchen replaced, which took nearly 12 months.\" \nTheir final insurance bill was around \u00a345,000. \nShe says they were fortunate to have qualified for a government scheme providing affordable insurance for homeowners in areas of high-flood risk.\nAlthough she loves the area, her neighbours and the house, the weather is now a cause of stress. \"We constantly worry about the weather, if it is going to rain longer than a couple of days, or there is a named storm. \n\"We do wish we had taken more steps to understand the risk. The survey showed that the property was in a medium flood zone, but there wasn't much detail other than flood zone maps.\"\nClimate change is increasing the likelihood and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, wildfires and hurricanes.\nWhile it might be too late for Ms Sneddon and other homeowners, new tools are being developed to help people and companies assess climate risk. \nLast December, the UK Environment Agency updated its National Flood Risk Assessment (NaFRA), showing current and future\u202fflood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water for England.\nIt used its own data alongside that of local authorities and climate data from the Met Office.\nIt also brought up to date the National Coastal Erosion Risk Map (NCERM). They were both last updated in 2018 and 2017 respectively.\nThe new NaFRA data shows as many as 6.3 million properties in England are in areas at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea or surface water, and with climate change this could increase to around eight million by 2050.\n\"We have spent the last few years transforming our understanding of flood and coastal erosion risk in England, drawing on the best available data... as well as improved modelling and technological advances,\" says Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency.\n\"When we account for the latest climate projections, one in four properties could be in areas at risk of flooding by the middle of the century.\"\nThe Environment Agency plans to launch a portal where users can check their long-term flood risk. \nSimilar resources exist for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales through the ABI.\n\"We can no longer rely on historical data,\" says Lukky Ahmed, co-founder of Climate X. \nThe London-based climate risk firm offers a digital twin of the Earth, which simulates different extreme weather events and their potential impact on properties, infrastructure and assets under different emissions scenarios.\nIt combines artificial intelligence with physics-based climate models.\n\"While many climate models might tell you how much rainfall to expect, they don't say what happens when that water hits the ground,\" he says.\n\"Our models simulate, for example, what happens when the water hits, where it travels and what the impact of the flooding will be.\"\nWhile banks and other lenders are testing their product, property companies are currently using their services when considering new developments.\n\"They log into our platform and identify locations and existing building stock and in return they receive risk rating and severity metrics tied to hazards,\" says Mr Ahmed.\nMany parts of the world have much more extreme weather than the UK.\nIn the US in January, devastating wild fires tore through parts of Los Angeles. Meanwhile Hurricane Milton, which landed last October, is likely to be one of the costliest hurricanes to hit west Florida.\nTo help insurers manage those costs, New York-based Faura analyses the resilience of homes and commercial buildings.\n\"We look at the different elements of a property to understand how likely it is to survive and pinpoint resilience and survivability of a property,\" says Faura co-founder Valkyrie Holmes.\n\"We tell companies and homeowners whether their property will still be standing after a disaster, not just whether a disaster will happen in an area,\" he adds.\nFaura bases its assessments on satellite and aerial imagery and data from surveys and disaster reports.\n\"Insurance companies technically have the data to be able to do this but have not build out the models to quantify it,\" says Mr Holmes.\nOther services are popping up for homebuyers. For the properties it markets, US firm Redfin, estimates the percentage chance of natural disasters, such as flooding and wildfires, occurring up to the next 30 years across each property.\n\"If people are looking at two homes with the same layout in the same neighbourhood, then climate risk will make or break [their decision],\" says Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather.\nAs for Ms Sneddon, following her personal experience, she now works for flood risk company The FPS Group.\n\"Flood risk is only going to get worse over the coming years so it is essential to find out as much as you can about the flood risk to a property,\" she advises.\n\"Flooding has a huge impact on communities and mental health. You are supposed to feel safe in your home, it shouldn't be a place of worry and anxiety.\"",

Stuart has such a low penalty count and gets through so much good work, and it's the same for Genge - the nuts and bolts of his game are superb.\"\nThe engine room in the second row remains the same, with Barclay suggesting England captain Maro Itoje is a Lions skipper in waiting.\nIn the back row, Barclay has named Jac Morgan in his side despite Wales' run of 17 consecutive defeats and a second Wooden Spoon in as many years.\nMorgan made a tournament high 88 tackles, while only Itoje arrived at more rucks on both sides of the ball.\nThe Welshman replaces Scotland's Rory Darge, who made more cleanouts than any other player (45) but Barclay says Morgan could reach greater heights in the Lions set-up.\n\"I had Rory Darge in the back row but I think he has fallen off slightly.

        "article_text": "'Complicated' but 'honest' - Tuchel's path from barman to England boss\nA new era in English football starts on Friday.\nGerman Thomas Tuchel will become the third non-British permanent manager to lead the England side after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.\nUnder Gareth Southgate, the Three Lions reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and lost in the 2021 and 2024 Euros finals.\nFor the 51-year-old Tuchel, who has an 18-month contract, his job brief is clear, but hugely difficult \u2013 to qualify for and then win the 2026 World Cup.\nHe will be looking to make a lightning start as England have two home qualifiers first up \u2013 Albania at Wembley before entertaining Latvia on Monday.\nBut what can they expect from Tuchel, who guided Chelsea to the Champions League title in 2021, and who has also managed Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich?\nBBC Sport has spoken to those who know Tuchel well to find out more.\n'Incredible' Tuchel helped Gibbs-White over England upset\nHas Tuchel's first squad revealed England's short-term strategy?\nPick your England XI for World Cup qualifiers - and fans have their say\nThis video can not be played\nFrom bartender to England manager - Rangnick reflects on Tuchel's journey\nTuchel, who stands at 6ft 4in, was a defender during his playing days.\nHe began at second-tier German side Stuttgarter Kickers, before three years at third division team SSV Ulm until a serious knee injury ended his playing career in 1998, when he was 25.\nHis boss at Ulm was Ralf Rangnick, who went on to manage Schalke, RB Leipzig, Manchester United and is now Austria's head coach.\n\"He was always interested in why we were doing certain things,\" said Rangnick. \"After a couple of weeks, you can tell what player could become a coach - he was always asking questions.\"\nIn 2000, a successful coaching career seemed a long way off for Tuchel, who was pulling pints and collecting glasses.\n\"When I became head coach of Stuttgart, I found out he was working in a bar to earn a living, I could hardly believe it,\" added Rangnick.\n\"I called him and said, 'Why don't you come to us and work as a youth team coach?' That's how his coaching career started.\n\"It was clear he shouldn't be working in a bar and would much rather be on a pitch with a team.\"\nThomas Tuchel was managing in the German Bundesliga at the age of 35 with Mainz\nTuchel worked with Stuttgart Under-15s and a few years later would guide their under-19s to their league title.\nHis first managerial role came in 2007 at FC Augsburg II and two years later he was in charge of Bundesliga outfit Mainz, who had Jurgen Klopp among their former bosses.\nRangnick was not surprised Tuchel would manage at the top level and added: \"Thomas is a very bright, intelligent person. He studied sports in Stuttgart. It was obvious he had quite a few assets of what you need as a manager.\"\nTuchel would also learn from, and emulate, those around him.\nIn five years at Mainz, he qualified for Europe twice, guiding them to fifth in 2010-11, their best ever Bundesliga position.\n\"Tuchel is someone who has been influenced by a lot of managers and coaches \u2013 it's clear he has a constant desire to learn, to be open-minded and curious,\" said former Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger.\n\"Ralf Rangnick is one of the coaches who has influenced him - what are you doing when you don't have the ball, how do you win it back, then how do you create chances and score goals?\n\"Tuchel took elements of that, but another element is focused on what you do with the ball too.\n\"With that aspect, Tuchel is very close to Pep Guardiola in terms of the way he thinks about football and how to create chances from your own possession.\n\"Pep was more of a coach he looked up to, in the time they spent together in the Bundesliga [when Guardiola was in charge of Bayern Munich] there was a bond, a relationship forged. They are still friends and they talk regularly.\"\nThomas Tuchel was sacked by Borussia Dortmund three days after winning the German Cup\nIn 2015, Tuchel began his next challenge, replacing Liverpool-bound Klopp as boss of Borussia Dortmund.\nDuring Klopp's seven years at Dortmund, he had won the Bundesliga twice and reached the Champions League final, and Tuchel had to win over his new players, with not all of them keen.\n\"I honestly didn't expect much when it was announced he was going to be the new manager. I was even in talks maybe to leave the club,\" recalled former Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan.\n\"I had one phone call with him and he presented himself to me when I was on holiday in the summer break, and it was actually a really good call.\n\"He tried to explain a few things, how he wanted us to play, how he wanted us to train and everything he said he proved during that season.\"\nGundogan joined Manchester City after Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga at the end of that 2015-16 campaign, while Tuchel claimed the first major trophy of his career, beating Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 in the final of the German Cup in May 2017, in what proved to be his last match at the club.\nFormer Germany international Gundogan, though, was completely won over by Tuchel in their sole season together.\n\"I can only say positive things about him from when we were at Dortmund,\" he added. \"He's outstanding tactically and extremely honest and open. Personally, I got along very well with him.\"\nHitzlsperger felt Tuchel's man-management skills would be key to success with England and added: \"The players Tuchel has worked with in the past are very positive about him, and the way he communicates his ideas to them.\n\"I don't think the fact he is German will make any difference. Most of the England players work under foreign managers, or have done. He's a top manager so they will be open to his ideas and used to most of them, so it should be a smooth transition.\"\nRangnick added: \"He's somebody who loves to improve people. As a head coach, you need to be analytic and intelligent. He is curious, funny with a good sense of humour. A very specific humour and, if you know the humour, he can be funny.\"\nThomas Tuchel won Uefa Men's Coach of the Year for 2020-21 after guiding Chelsea to the Champions League\nApart from his almost five-year spell at Mainz, all of Tuchel's jobs have followed a similar pattern \u2013 successful, but not in the same role for long.\nAfter Dortmund, he won Ligue 1 twice and took Paris St-Germain to the Champions League final in a two-and-a-half-year spell.\nChelsea came next, getting the job in January 2021 and winning the Champions League just four months later, beating Guardiola and Gundogan's Manchester City side 1-0 in the final.\nHowever, despite also winning the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup, he was sacked in September 2022.\nBefore England, Bayern Munich was his last managerial job in March 2023, and he instantly won the Bundesliga title within a few months, but was gone at the end of the next campaign - a season that ended without any silverware despite the goals of England captain Harry Kane.\nThis video can not be played\n'We have to free ourselves from history' - new England boss Tuchel\n\"Thomas is not an easy person, or easy to deal with, but all good coaches are complicated,\" said Christian Heidel, Mainz's long-time executive and sporting director, in 2021.\n\"Complicated means they are also tough. They make demands of those around them, their players from morning to night and for that reason, they are incredible coaches.\"\nFormer Augsburg youth coach Heiner Schuhmann described Tuchel as \"an outstanding, passionate player on the pitch, who gave his all\", but felt \"he was so exacting and demanding, which didn't go down well with some of the players\".\nHitzlsperger also felt Tuchel could \"rub people up the wrong way\" in his dealings with club officials and would have to try to avoid that happening with the English Football Association.\n\"It's important Tuchel maintains a good relationship with the FA, the people who have brought him in, and he has to handle the media and public,\" said the former Aston Villa and Stuttgart midfielder.\n\"The same thing must not happen that happened in Bayern and Dortmund, where he fell out with his bosses. I am optimistic there won't be too many disagreements, because at his previous clubs it was often about transfers, which as a national team manager is not an issue.\n\"With the media and the fans, it's different. The advantage he has is he has worked in this country before with Chelsea, so knows what English fans are like.\"\nThomas Tuchel's England side have been drawn in World Cup Qualifying Group K, along with Albania, Andorra, Latvia and Serbia\nTuchel started the England job on 1 January and has been regularly spotted at Premier League matches.\nHe has already shown he will do the job his way, handing a surprise recall to 34-year-old Ajax midfielder Jordan Henderson, as well as first international call-ups for 32-year-old Newcastle defender Dan Burn and 18-year-old Arsenal left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly.\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer felt Tuchel would want to get the best out of the team immediately and said: \"We've been down the route so many times of an English manager having this hope, this belief in three or four years' time we might be this.\n\"This manager has been brought in for now, for the next 18 months, to win the World Cup. That's his job. If he doesn't win the World Cup he won't be here.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBrotherhood, Ben White and playing style - Tuchel answers key questions\nHitzlsperger felt Tuchel could succeed and his nationality would soon be ignored if England were winning matches.\n\"His experience in club management will help him with England,\" he added. \"He had to deal with some of the biggest names in world football at PSG for example, and was expected to win everything in France and in European competition.\n\"Hopefully the players want to play for their country because they think this is fun, they play good football and enjoy the way they play.\n\"He will get people excited and out of their seats, thinking 'this is great football, this is what we wanted to see'.\"\nThe 2026 World Cup will be held in Canada, the United States and Mexico and Tuchel will be aiming to become only the second manager to guide England to World Cup glory after Sir Alf Ramsey in 1966.\n\"I would never say, 'he is going to win the World Cup', but he has got one of the best squads in the world, along with Spain, France, Argentina, and Brazil,\" said Hitzlsperger.\n\"Tuchel is probably hoping to play Germany at some stage. Can you imagine? Putting one over Germany in a World Cup \u2013 that would be very sweet for him and it probably wouldn't get any bigger.\n\"If he were to put one over them it would be one of the biggest achievements, just after winning the World Cup, and beating Germany on the way would be fantastic for him.\"",

President Trump signed an executive order on Friday to cut their funding after Musk had scorned them on X, saying \"shut them down\".The move contrasts with the media policies of authorities in Russia, China and Iran, who have poured funding into their state broadcasters to counter the impact of Western liberalism around the world.Most of VOA's full-time staff have been put on administrative leave and the broadcaster's contractors, who dominate the non-English language services, have been laid off, the AFP news agency reports. Turmoil as Trump and Musk take aim at top US aid agencyHow a US freeze upended global aid in a matter of days Trump administration to cut billions from biomedical research fundingCzech Republic \"The Iranian Ayatollahs, Chinese communist leaders, and autocrats in Moscow and Minsk would celebrate the demise of RFE/RL after 75 years,\" he added.Mr Capus's concern was echoed by the independent Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which complained that thousands of journalists would be hit by the US funding cut - and that some working in censored countries were already \"in grave danger\".RFE/RL says it reaches a weekly audience of nearly 50 million people in 23 countries, including Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Afghanistan and ex-Soviet republics in Central Asia and the Caucasus.Czech foreign minister Mr Lipavsky told the BBC he was working on building a \"platform of countries\" to support the station, but added that they \"need to be very careful and mindful of the USA, which has this operation on their side\".",

That's how his coaching career started.\n\"It was clear he shouldn't be working in a bar and would much rather be on a pitch with a team.\"\nThomas Tuchel was managing in the German Bundesliga at the age of 35 with Mainz\nTuchel worked with Stuttgart Under-15s and a few years later would guide their under-19s to their league title.\nHis first managerial role came in 2007 at FC Augsburg II and two years later he was in charge of Bundesliga outfit Mainz, who had Jurgen Klopp among their former bosses.\nRangnick was not surprised Tuchel would manage at the top level and added: \"Thomas is a very bright, intelligent person. He studied sports in Stuttgart. It was obvious he had quite a few assets of what you need as a manager.\"\nTuchel would also learn from, and emulate, those around him.\nIn five years at Mainz, he qualified for Europe twice, guiding them to fifth in 2010-11, their best ever Bundesliga position.\n\"Tuchel is someone who has been influenced by a lot of managers and coaches \u2013 it's clear he has a constant desire to learn, to be open-minded and curious,\" said former Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger.\n\"Ralf Rangnick is one of the coaches who has influenced him - what are you doing when you don't have the ball, how do you win it back, then how do you create chances and score goals?\n\"Tuchel took elements of that, but another element is focused on what you do with the ball too.\n\"With that aspect, Tuchel is very close to Pep Guardiola in terms of the way he thinks about football and how to create chances from your own possession.\n\"Pep was more of a coach he looked up to, in the time they spent together in the Bundesliga [when Guardiola was in charge of Bayern Munich] there was a bond, a relationship forged. They are still friends and they talk regularly.\"\nThomas Tuchel was sacked by Borussia Dortmund three days after winning the German Cup\nIn 2015, Tuchel began his next challenge, replacing Liverpool-bound Klopp as boss of Borussia Dortmund.\nDuring Klopp's seven years at Dortmund, he had won the Bundesliga twice and reached the Champions League final, and Tuchel had to win over his new players, with not all of them keen.\n\"I honestly didn't expect much when it was announced he was going to be the new manager. I was even in talks maybe to leave the club,\" recalled former Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan.\n\"I had one phone call with him and he presented himself to me when I was on holiday in the summer break, and it was actually a really good call.\n\"He tried to explain a few things, how he wanted us to play, how he wanted us to train and everything he said he proved during that season.\"\nGundogan joined Manchester City after Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga at the end of that 2015-16 campaign, while Tuchel claimed the first major trophy of his career, beating Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 in the final of the German Cup in May 2017, in what proved to be his last match at the club.\nFormer Germany international Gundogan, though, was completely won over by Tuchel in their sole season together.\n\"I can only say positive things about him from when we were at Dortmund,\" he added. \"He's outstanding tactically and extremely honest and open. Personally, I got along very well with him.\"\nHitzlsperger felt Tuchel's man-management skills would be key to success with England and added: \"The players Tuchel has worked with in the past are very positive about him, and the way he communicates his ideas to them.\n\"I don't think the fact he is German will make any difference. Most of the England players work under foreign managers, or have done. He's a top manager so they will be open to his ideas and used to most of them, so it should be a smooth transition.\"\nRangnick added: \"He's somebody who loves to improve people. As a head coach, you need to be analytic and intelligent. He is curious, funny with a good sense of humour. A very specific humour and, if you know the humour, he can be funny.\"\nThomas Tuchel won Uefa Men's Coach of the Year for 2020-21 after guiding Chelsea to the Champions League\nApart from his almost five-year spell at Mainz, all of Tuchel's jobs have followed a similar pattern \u2013 successful, but not in the same role for long.\nAfter Dortmund, he won Ligue 1 twice and took Paris St-Germain to the Champions League final in a two-and-a-half-year spell.\nChelsea came next, getting the job in January 2021 and winning the Champions League just four months later, beating Guardiola and Gundogan's Manchester City side 1-0 in the final.\nHowever, despite also winning the Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup, he was sacked in September 2022.\nBefore England, Bayern Munich was his last managerial job in March 2023, and he instantly won the Bundesliga title within a few months, but was gone at the end of the next campaign - a season that ended without any silverware despite the goals of England captain Harry Kane.\nThis video can not be played\n'We have to free ourselves from history' - new England boss Tuchel\n\"Thomas is not an easy person, or easy to deal with, but all good coaches are complicated,\" said Christian Heidel, Mainz's long-time executive and sporting director, in 2021.\n\"Complicated means they are also tough. They make demands of those around them, their players from morning to night and for that reason, they are incredible coaches.\"\nFormer Augsburg youth coach Heiner Schuhmann described Tuchel as \"an outstanding, passionate player on the pitch, who gave his all\", but felt \"he was so exacting and demanding, which didn't go down well with some of the players\".\nHitzlsperger also felt Tuchel could \"rub people up the wrong way\" in his dealings with club officials and would have to try to avoid that happening with the English Football Association.\n\"It's important Tuchel maintains a good relationship with the FA, the people who have brought him in, and he has to handle the media and public,\" said the former Aston Villa and Stuttgart midfielder.\n\"The same thing must not happen that happened in Bayern and Dortmund, where he fell out with his bosses. I am optimistic there won't be too many disagreements, because at his previous clubs it was often about transfers, which as a national team manager is not an issue.\n\"With the media and the fans, it's different. The advantage he has is he has worked in this country before with Chelsea, so knows what English fans are like.\"\nThomas Tuchel's England side have been drawn in World Cup Qualifying Group K, along with Albania, Andorra, Latvia and Serbia\nTuchel started the England job on 1 January and has been regularly spotted at Premier League matches.\nHe has already shown he will do the job his way, handing a surprise recall to 34-year-old Ajax midfielder Jordan Henderson, as well as first international call-ups for 32-year-old Newcastle defender Dan Burn and 18-year-old Arsenal left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly.\nFormer England captain Alan Shearer felt Tuchel would want to get the best out of the team immediately and said: \"We've been down the route so many times of an English manager having this hope, this belief in three or four years' time we might be this.\n\"This manager has been brought in for now, for the next 18 months, to win the World Cup. That's his job. If he doesn't win the World Cup he won't be here.\"\nThis video can not be played\nBrotherhood, Ben White and playing style - Tuchel answers key questions\nHitzlsperger felt Tuchel could succeed and his nationality would soon be ignored if England were winning matches.\n\"His experience in club management will help him with England,\" he added. \"He had to deal with some of the biggest names in world football at PSG for example, and was expected to win everything in France and in European competition.\n\"Hopefully the players want to play for their country because they think this is fun, they play good football and enjoy the way they play.\n\"He will get people excited and out of their seats, thinking 'this is great football, this is what we wanted to see'.\"\nThe 2026 World Cup will be held in Canada, the United States and Mexico and Tuchel will be aiming to become only the second manager to guide England to World Cup glory after Sir Alf Ramsey in 1966.\n\"I would never say, 'he is going to win the World Cup', but he has got one of the best squads in the world, along with Spain, France, Argentina, and Brazil,\" said Hitzlsperger.\n\"Tuchel is probably hoping to play Germany at some stage. Can you imagine? Putting one over Germany in a World Cup \u2013 that would be very sweet for him and it probably wouldn't get any bigger.\n\"If he were to put one over them it would be one of the biggest achievements, just after winning the World Cup, and beating Germany on the way would be fantastic for him.\"\nThis video can not be played\nEngland played with fear, we have to change that - Tuchel",

The issue is covered under a warranty for new owners, and the company will replace the piece free-of-charge.Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon MuskMusk's Tesla raises concern over Trump tariffsTrump says anti-Tesla protesters will face 'hell''Tornado crisis'Tesla's shares have dropped nearly 40% since January, erasing the jump in value that it enjoyed after the 2024 US election.The fall has been significantly more than the overall drop in the US stock market over that period.Dan Ives, an analyst who has historically been very pro-Tesla, said on Thursday the firm was facing a \"tornado crisis moment\" due to brand damage from Musk's political role.The political backlash adds to the challenges the company had already been facing from increased competition and an ageing line-up of offerings. \"The cant rail, a stainless-steel exterior trim panel, can delaminate and detach from the vehicle,\" the notice said. It estimated that the issue affected about 1% of vehicles involved in the recall.",

        "article_text": "The Malaysian cabinet has approved a fresh search for the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, more than a decade after the aircraft vanished.\nThe search will cover a 15,000 sq km area in the southern Indian Ocean, under a \"no find, no fee\" agreement with the exploration firm Ocean Infinity. \nThe company will receive $70m (\u00a356m) if the wreckage is found, transport minister Loke Siew Fook announced.\nFlight MH370 disappeared in 2014 with 239 people on board while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Its disappearance is one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries, which continues to haunt the families of the passengers.\nDespite extensive searches in the years since it vanished, no wreckage has been found. Previous efforts, including a multinational search that cost $150m (\u00a3120m), ended in 2017.\nThe governments of the three nations involved - Malaysia, Australia and China - said the search would only be resumed \"should credible new evidence emerge\" of the aircraft's location.\nA 2018 search for the wreckage by Ocean Infinity under similar terms ended unsuccessfully after three months.\nIn December, Malaysia's government agreed in principle to resume the search. However, the final negotiations were not completed until March.\nMalaysia's final approval on Wednesday will now allow the search to begin.\nLoke said in a statement: \"The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the MH370 passengers.\"\nFlight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur in the early hours of 8 March 2014. Less than an hour after takeoff, it lost communication with air traffic control, and radar showed that it had deviated from its planned flight path. \nInvestigators generally agree that the plane crashed somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean, though the reason for the crash remains unclear. \nPieces of debris, believed to be from the plane, have washed up on the shores of the Indian Ocean in the years following its disappearance.\nThe aircraft's disappearance has given rise to a host of conspiracy theories, including speculation that the pilot had deliberately brought the plane down and claims that it had been shot down by a foreign military.\nAn investigation in 2018 into the aircraft's disappearance found that the plane's controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course, but drew no conclusions behind it. \nInvestigators said at the time that \"the answer can only be conclusive if the wreckage is found\".\nThe passengers included people from more than a dozen countries: just under two-thirds were Chinese nationals, followed by 38 Malaysians, with others from Australia, Indonesia, India, France, Ukraine, the US and several other nations.\nFamily members of missing Chinese MH370 passengers met with officials in Beijing earlier in March to discuss the renewed search for the wreckage and express their hopes for an independent search. Some relatives voiced their frustration over a lack of direct communication from the Malaysian authorities.\n\"It was promised that we would be informed immediately [but] we can only find out about this kind of news online,\" said Li Eryou, a 68-year-old father who lost his 29-year-old son. \n\"Many families don't even know how to access this information, so they are completely unaware,\" he told AFP.\nGrieving families gathered outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing on the eleventh anniversary of the flight's disappearance earlier this month, chanting: \"Give us back our loved ones!\"\nCheng Liping, whose husband had been in Malaysia for a film shoot and had been returning to China on MH370, said she hoped Beijing would communicate more with Malaysia to uncover the truth. \n\"Everyone has been left trapped in pain,\" she told reporters. \"What exactly happened is still unknown.\"\nThe fresh search prompted mixed reactions from the families of passengers when it was announced in December - with some calling it a step towards closure, while others describing the news as bittersweet.",

        "article_text": "Towns in France and Belgium have been giving out free chickens for years to combat food waste \u2013 could the idea catch on elsewhere?\nAround Easter in 2015, the French town of Colmar started handing out free chickens to its residents. The aim of this experimental new scheme, launched by the waste collection department in the town in north eastern France, was to reduce food waste.\nThe project had been in the works for some time. The then-president of Colmar Agglom\u00e9ration (a role similar to a mayor), Gilbert Meyer, had been reelected in 2014 with the slogan \"one family, one hen\", which aimed to encourage residents to adopt a chicken. The following year the operation was launched, in partnership with two nearby chicken farms. Residents were encouraged to think of the free eggs \u2013\u00a0the effort put into raising a chicken would pay off quickly.\nMore than 200 homes in four municipalities signed up and were given two chickens each \u2013 either red chickens (Poulet Rouge) or Alsace chickens, an old and local breed.\nEach household signed a pledge committing to raising the chickens, with the understanding that the waste department could conduct welfare spot checks on the animals at any time. Henhouses were not provided; it was up to the residents to build or buy their own. The department ensured that each home had enough space for the hens \u2013\u00a0between 8 and 10 sq m (86 and 108 sq ft).\nThe scheme was a success \u2013 and is still underway. \"Over the years, other municipalities have joined and since 2022 all 20 municipalities of the agglom\u00e9ration have participated,\" says Eric Straumann, current president of the Colmar Agglom\u00e9ration.\nTo date, 5,282 hens have been distributed to local residents, and applications are currently open for the next round of distribution in June 2025. Not only have the residents received a plentiful supply of free eggs, but food waste has also been averted from landfill as\u00a0chickens are fed kitchen scraps which would otherwise be thrown away.\n\"Considering that a hen has a life expectancy of four years on average and that she consumes 150g (5.3oz) of bio-waste per day, we estimate that we have avoided 273.35 tonnes of bio-waste [since 2015],\" says Straumann.\nFood waste contributes more methane emissions to the atmosphere than any other landfilled materials, due to its quick decay rate. In the US, around 58% of methane emissions released into the atmosphere from waste landfills are from food waste. Although shorter-lived in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane has a global warming impact more than\u00a080 times higher than CO2 over a 20-year period.\u00a0\nAround one third of food produced for humans is lost or wasted globally, amounting to 1.3 billion tonnes per year. Food loss and waste account for 8-10% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 which is nearly five times the total emissions from the aviation sector.\nEven though chicken owners in the UK have been advised to avoid to feeding the birds kitchen scraps due to concerns about spreading disease, it's perfectly legal to do so elsewhere in the world, and it can have a meaningful impact on reducing food waste\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and kickstart a cycle that benefits everyone.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 The rewilded golf courses teeming with life\n\u2022 Why Vermont farmers are using urine on their crops\n\u2022 The 100-year-old fish that don't seem to age\n\"Proposed with the aim of reducing food waste, chickens make it possible to promote traditional circular economy practices that are still relevant today, particularly in villages, and which are now developing even in urban areas: chickens fed on our food waste in return provide us with fresh eggs,\" says Straumann.\nAn additional benefit is that the chickens can teach children in Colmar about animals and the importance of protecting the natural world, he adds.\nCarbon Count\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nColmar is not the only town to hand out free birds \u2013 nor was it the first to do so. In 2012 in another a small north-western French town called Pinc\u00e9, \u00adtwo chickens were offered to each household to help them cut down on organic waste. \"To begin with it was a joke, but then we realised it was a very good idea,\" Lydie Pasteau, the mayor of Pinc\u00e9, told local media at the time. A total of 31 families were given chickens, along with a bag of feed, with Pasteau calling the scheme a \"surprising\" success.\u00a0\nIn Belgium, chickens have been handed out in the cities of Mouscron and Antwerp and the province of Limburg, although residents had to sign an agreement not to eat the chickens for at least two years. More than 2,500 families adopted hens in one year alone in Limburg, according to some reports, while in Mouscron, 50 pairs of chickens were given out in the second round of the scheme, after the initial giveaway was a success. Residents, who had to prove they had sufficient space in their gardens to keep the birds, were given basic instructions on chicken keeping.\nIn theory, the scheme seems like a good idea, especially in parts of the world where eggs are either in shortage or very expensive. In California or New York, for example, a dozen eggs cost around $9 (\u00a37). As some chicken breeds can lay up to 300 eggs every year, one chicken could lay up to $225 (\u00a3178) worth of eggs each year.\nIn practice though, Paul Behrens, a professor at the University of Oxford focusing on food systems, says there are some hurdles in the way: \"I'm sure it could be done in the UK but I'm not sure it's a good idea,\" he says. \"Bird flu is an ever-present worry. Current regulations mean you have to keep birds in fenced areas or indoors \u2013 this may again be a problem for animal welfare, or even disease spread if people don't do this.\"\nThe idea wouldn't work well in the US either, says Mark Bomford, director of Yale University's sustainable food programme. \"I love chickens, but I don't love the sound of this, especially in the US,\" Bomford says.\nThe US is currently experiencing an egg shortage due to an outbreak of bird flu\u00a0\u2013 and as a result egg prices have skyrocketed 36% compared to 2023 \u2013\u00a0but handing out free chickens would not be an \"appropriate\" response, Bomford says.\n\"Economically, steep inflation for a basic grocery item like eggs hurts the poor far more than it hurts the rich. To care for chickens you need feed, water, housing, space and free time,\" he says. \"Most people with lower incomes don't have access to these things. By the time you have factored in all these costs, chickens are rarely 'free' and few people realise any net cost savings on eggs.\"\nOne couple, however, did come up with a unique solution \u2013 renting chickens. Christine and Brian Templeton of Rent The Chicken in New Hampshire provide hens, feed and support for six months, allowing customers to collect fresh eggs at home. Business, the couple reports, is booming.\nIt's important to temper egg expectations though, warns Behrens \u2013\u00a0industrial birds lay far more eggs than a home-kept healthy bird would. \"Common and modern egg-laying birds are often in huge pain their entire lives, partly due to their genetics which are centred on providing as much 'output' as possible,\" he says. \"If you use older breeds and allow them to live a long, healthy life then you can avoid many of the most egregious animal welfare issues.\"\n\"But people should then understand the tradeoff and expectations around that, you are having a much healthier bird in return for fewer eggs,\" he says.\nAnd from a food waste perspective, the ideal thing is to simply not waste the food in the first place\u00a0\u2013\u00a0some researchers believe that composting can actually increase food waste.\n\"They think 'oh, it's okay as we compost',\" says Behrens. \"Which is better than nothing but much worse than not wasting things in the first place. It could be even worse with chickens because you are getting eggs from them. People might waste even more than if they composted.\"\nBut one unexpected benefit that was observed in Colmar \u2013 that had nothing to do with eggs or food waste \u2013 was the community the chickens created. Residents would bond over raising the chickens and would work with neighbours to care for the chickens when they went on holiday. \"Residents have welcomed this operation since its launch,\" says Straumann. \"And that's why all the municipalities in Colmar still participate in our programme today.\"\n--\nCorrection: This article originally referred to Colmar as a small village.

        "article_text": "Rory McIlroy is the first European to win the Players Championship more than once\nRory McIlroy woke early, far too early. It was 03:00 on Monday morning and his stomach was already starting to churn. He was three holes away from winning a second Players Championship and he felt the trophy should already be his.\nWould this prove another big victory to elude him? The world number 57, JJ Spaun, stood between him and one of the most coveted crowns in the game.\nAs it turned out, the 35-year-old Northern Irishman was going to be able to celebrate this St Patrick's Day in style. McIlroy channelled his nerves while his American opponent faltered - his hopes drowning when he overshot the island green 17th, the second of the three play-off holes.\nIt sets up McIlroy perfectly for his latest tilt at completing the career Grand Slam of major titles when he goes to Augusta for next month's Masters. That's where the chat is going - will he do it and finally, at long, long last don the famous Green Jacket?\n\"I feel like I'm a better player now than I ever have been,\" he said. \"I feel like I can play all conditions and in anything that comes my way.\"\nMcIlroy beats Spaun in play-off to win Players\nMcIlroy defeats Spaun in play-off to win second Players title - shot by shot\n'Slow progress & slow play lead PGA Tour's agenda'\nThis video can not be played\nIt's the most nervous I've been in a long time - McIlroy\nFirst he must celebrate this win. It was achieved without his very best golf.\nIt would be an exaggeration to say he won it ugly, but he did it with a largely errant driver and was able to put himself in contention in a way that was beyond golf's other leading lights.\nSawgrass is a capricious test at the best of times. Throw in the fierce gusting winds of Saturday, Sunday's four-hour storm delay and the cold breeze of the extra morning, which blew from a completely different direction, and it is the toughest of propositions.\nIt had already been too much for defending champion Scottie Scheffler, likewise Open and US PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, who only scraped into the weekend. It was too much too for Ludwig Aberg, who missed the cut.\nMcIlroy held it together, coming from four behind on the final day to lead by three before being caught by Spaun to force a play-off for which Sunday evening did not hold sufficient daylight.\nYes McIlroy was nervous on Monday. As nervous as he has ever been over a tee shot when the play-off began - but he did not show it. Instead, he striped a majestic drive to tell Spaun unequivocally who was the boss for this shootout.\nThere is an encouraging pragmatism about McIlroy these days. Deciding to abandon erratic new woods three rounds into the Arnold Palmer Invitational last week was an important change of mind.\nThe $1,000 taxi fare to ferry his old woods from his West Palm Beach mansion was money very well spent as he went back to his old set-up for Sawgrass, home of the biggest tournament of the year so far.\nAnd then before the play-off, McIlroy changed his hitting angles to rehearse the nine-iron shot into the wind that he would need for the pivotal second hole of the play-off.\nExperience told in both instances, just as it did when he abandoned big hitting for the final hole at Pebble Beach in February to secure his first PGA Tour title of 2025.\nAnd then came his honest admission of the nerves he was feeling. It is as though he was embracing them rather than allowing them to be the sort of demon that derailed him when he held a winning position at last year's US Open.\n\"I woke up at 03:00 this morning and couldn't get back to sleep,\" he told reporters. \"I was as nervous as I can remember.\"\nWhich is why the opening drive of the play-off was so important. He needed to go out and get the victory.\n\"If you play to win and you've hit an aggressive shot and you've hit a really good shot, I think that can relax you and it can calm your nervous system,\" he said.\n\"If you're playing sort of 'guidey' golf and just trying to not lose, I don't think that sort of golf calms you down.\"\nMcIlroy revealed he felt a turning point after painfully losing last year's Irish Open.  The following week he charged into a play-off at Wentworth and although he lost it to Billy Horschel's eagle in the BMW PGA shoot out there was hope.\nThen he went to the Middle East and ended his season with a crucial victory in the DP World Tour Championship. \"I feel that period, October, November, was a pretty important one,\" he said.\n\"And I was able to do some good work on my swing and then test it out pretty much straight after in a couple of tournaments, and I feel like that's carried into this year.\n\"It doesn't feel like I'm making those mistakes at the critical times like I was previously. I think a big part of that was just learning from those mistakes.\"\nAnd so to carry the momentum to Georgia next month. There will be a stop in Texas prior to the Masters, but already none of his big rivals can boast such an impressive form line heading into the year's first major.\n\"It's about doubling down and working on the things I've been working on,\" McIlroy told BBC Sport. \"And to make sure that I'm 100% ready to go for Augusta.\"",

How do we construct these chains of reasoning? How do we explain what what is actually going on in a large language model?\" said Simone Stumpf, professor of responsible and interactive AI at the University of Glasgow.\nProf Stumpf says that can even apply to people who work behind the scenes on these types of models.\n\"Even if you are more involved in the development of these systems quite often, you do not know how they actually work, why they're coming up with this particular information that they came up with,\" she told the BBC. \nChatGPT has changed its model since Mr Holmen's search in August 2024, and now searches current news articles when it looks for relevant information.\nNoyb told the BBC Mr Holmen had made a number of searches that day, including putting his brother's name into the chatbot and it produced \"multiple different stories that were all incorrect.\"\nThey also acknowledged the previous searches could have influenced the answer about his children, but said large language models are a \"black box\" and OpenAI \"doesn't reply to access requests, which makes it impossible to find out more about what exact data is in the system.\"",

        "article_text": "Chinese state media has welcomed Donald Trump's move to cut public funding for news outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which have long reported on authoritarian regimes.\nThe decision affects thousands of employees - some 1,300 staff have been put on paid leave at Voice Of America (VOA) alone since Friday's executive order.\nCritics have called the move a setback for democracy but Beijing's state newspaper Global Times denounced VOA for its \"appalling track record\" in reporting on China and said it has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\".\nThe White House defended the move, saying it will \"ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\".\nTrump's cuts target the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which is supported by Congress and funds the affected news outlets, such as VOA, Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Radio Free Europe.\nThey have won acclaim and international recognition for their reporting in places where press freedom is severely curtailed or non-existent, from China and Cambodia to Russia and North Korea.\nAlthough authorities in some of these countries block the broadcasts - VOA, for instance, is banned in China - people can listen to them on shortwave radio, or get around the restrictions via VPNs.\nRFA has often reported on the crackdown on human rights in Cambodia, whose former authoritarian ruler Hun Sen has hailed the cuts as a \"big contribution to eliminating fake news\".\nIt was also among the first news outlets to report on China's network of detention centres in Xinjiang, where the authorities are accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims without trial. Beijing denies the claims, saying people willingly attend \"re-education camps\" which combat \"terrorism and religious extremism\". VOA's reporting on North Korean defectors and the Chinese Communist Party's alleged cover-up of Covid fatalities has won awards.\nVOA, primarily a radio outlet, which also broadcasts in Mandarin, was recognised last year for its podcast on rare protests in 2022 in China against Covid lockdowns.\nBut China's Global Times welcomed the cuts, calling VOA a \"lie factory\".\n\"As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multi-dimensional China, the demonising narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughing stock,\" it said in an editorial published on Monday.\nHu Xijin, who was the Global Times' former editor-in-chief, wrote: \"Voice of America has been paralysed! And so has Radio Free Asia, which has been as vicious to China. This is such great news.\"\nSuch responses \"would have been easy to predict\", said Valdya Baraputri, a VOA journalist who lost her job over the weekend. She was previously employed by BBC World Service.\n\"Eliminating VOA, of course, allows channels that are the opposite of accurate and balanced reporting to thrive,\" she told the BBC.\nThe National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\".\nFounded during World War Two in part to counter Nazi propaganda, VOA reaches some 360 million people a week in nearly 50 languages. Over the years it has broadcast in China, North Korea, communist Cuba and the former Soviet Union. It's also been a helpful tool for many Chinese people to learn English.\nVOA's director Michael Abramowitz said Trump's order has hobbled VOA while \"America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\".\nMs Baraputri, who is from Indonesia but based in Washington DC, first joined VOA in 2018, but her visa was terminated at the end of Trump's first administration.\nShe rejoined in 2023 because she wanted to be part of an organisation that \"upholds unbiased, factual reporting that is free from government influence\".\nThe recent cuts have left her \"feeling betrayed by the idea I had about press freedom [in the US]\".\nShe is also concerned for colleagues who may now be forced to return to hostile home countries, where they could be persecuted for their journalism.\nMeanwhile, the Czech Republic has appealed to the European Union to intervene so it can keep Radio Free Europe going.

        "summary": "'Discarded like a dirty rag': Chinese state media hails Trump's cuts to Voice of America10 hours agoShareSaveKelly NgBBC NewsReporting fromSingapore ShareSaveEPASteve Lodge, whose father Robert Lodge was a correspondent at VOA, stands in protest in front of the organisation's headquarters in Washington DCChinese state media has welcomed Donald Trump's move to cut public funding for news outlets Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, which have long reported on authoritarian regimes.The decision affects thousands of employees - some 1,300 staff have been put on paid leave at Voice Of America (VOA) alone since Friday's executive order.Critics have called the move a setback for democracy but Beijing's state newspaper Global Times denounced VOA for its \"appalling track record\" in reporting on China and said it has \"now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag\".The White House defended the move, saying it will \"ensure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\".Trump's cuts target the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which is supported by Congress and funds the affected news outlets, such as VOA, Radio Free Asia (RFA) and Radio Free Europe.They have won acclaim and international recognition for their reporting in places where press freedom is severely curtailed or non-existent, from China and Cambodia to Russia and North Korea.Although authorities in some of these countries block the broadcasts - VOA, for instance, is banned in China - people can listen to them on shortwave radio, or get around the restrictions via VPNs.RFA has often reported on the crackdown on human rights in Cambodia, whose former authoritarian ruler Hun Sen has hailed the cuts as a \"big contribution to eliminating fake news\".It was also among the first news outlets to report on China's network of detention centres in Xinjiang, where the authorities are accused of locking up hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims without trial. It's also been a helpful tool for many Chinese people to learn English.VOA's director Michael Abramowitz said Trump's order has hobbled VOA while \"America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\".Ms Baraputri, who is from Indonesia but based in Washington DC, first joined VOA in 2018, but her visa was terminated at the end of Trump's first administration.She rejoined in 2023 because she wanted to be part of an organisation that \"upholds unbiased, factual reporting that is free from government influence\".Getty ImagesRFA was also among the first news outlets to report on China's network of detention centres in XinjiangThe recent cuts have left her \"feeling betrayed by the idea I had about press freedom [in the US]\".She is also concerned for colleagues who may now be forced to return to hostile home countries, where they could be persecuted for their journalism.Meanwhile, the Czech Republic has appealed to the European Union to intervene so it can keep Radio Free Europe going. \"[Trump's order] not only disenfranchises the nearly 60 million people who turn to RFA's reporting on a weekly basis to learn the truth, but it also benefits America's adversaries at our own expense,\" Mr Fang noted.While Chinese state media has celebrated the cuts, it's hard to know how Chinese people feel about it given their internet is heavily censored.Outside China, those who have listened to VOA and RFA over the years appear disappointed and worried. VOA's reporting on North Korean defectors and the Chinese Communist Party's alleged cover-up of Covid fatalities has won awards.Getty ImagesFormer US President Bill Clinton granted an exclusive interview to RFA on the eve of his trip to Beijing in 1998 - after RFA reporters were barred from ChinaVOA, primarily a radio outlet, which also broadcasts in Mandarin, was recognised last year for its podcast on rare protests in 2022 in China against Covid lockdowns.But China's Global Times welcomed the cuts, calling VOA a \"lie factory\". \"Eliminating VOA, of course, allows channels that are the opposite of accurate and balanced reporting to thrive,\" she told the BBC.The National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\".Founded during World War Two in part to counter Nazi propaganda, VOA reaches some 360 million people a week in nearly 50 languages.",

        "article_text": "The record for a single trip into space currently stands at 437 days, but prolonged periods in orbit can alter an astronaut's body in some surprising ways, changing their muscles, brains and even their gut bacteria.\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore never expected to stay in orbit for nine months. Their initial trip to the International Space Station onboard the Boeing Starliner spacecraft was scheduled to last just eight days in June 2024. But after technical problems with the spacecraft meant it had to return to Earth without them, their stay in space has been longer than expected. Now they are finally making a return to Earth, the pair will have to acclimatise to the full tug of our planet's gravity on their bodies after so long away from home.\nOf course, neither are new to the rigours of space travel. They are both experienced astronauts. But any extended time in the strange, low gravity environment of space is likely to have affected their bodies. To understand how, we need to look at those who have stays in space have been longer.\u00a0\nThe longest single spaceflight by an American to date was by Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio after he spent 371 days\u00a0living aboard the\u00a0American-football-field-sized collection of modules and solar panels that make up the ISS.\nHis time in orbit \u2013 which surpassed the previous US record of 355 consecutive days \u2013 was extended in March 2023 after the spacecraft he and his crewmates had been due to fly home in developed a coolant leak. He eventually came home in October 2023. The extra months in space allowed Rubio to clock up a total of 5,963 orbits around the Earth, travelling 157.4 million miles (253.3 million km).\nEven so, he was still around two months short of the record for the longest ever spaceflight by a human \u2013 Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov spent 437 days onboard the Mir Space Station in the mid 1990s.\nAnd in September 2024, two Russian cosmonauts \u2013 Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub \u2013 broke the record for the longest stay on the ISS after spending 374 days in orbit. The pair departed the ISS in the Soyuz MS-25 spacecraft along with US astronaut Tracy Dyson, who had spent six months onboard. With a huge grin on his face, Kononenko gave a double thumbs up as he was helped from the re-entry capsule after it bumped back to Earth in a cloud of dust near the remote town of Dzhezkazgan on the Kazakhstan Steppe. He now also holds the record for the longest cumulative time in space \u2013 a total of 1,111 days in orbit.\nKononenko and Chub travelled more than 158 million miles during their 5,984 orbits of the Earth in the latest mission to the ISS. But spending so much time in the low gravity environment of the space station took a toll on their bodies, so they had to be lifted out of the capsule by the recovery teams.\nRubio's own extended trip in space provided valuable insights into how humans can cope with long-duration spaceflight and how best to counteract the problems it can present. He is the first astronaut to participate in\u00a0a study examining how exercising with limited gym equipment can affect the human body.\nWhile the results have yet to be published, it is information that will prove vital as humans set their sights on sending crews on missions to explore deeper into the Solar System. A return journey to Mars, for example, is\u00a0expected to take around 1,100 days\u00a0(just over three years) under current plans. The spacecraft they will travel in will be far smaller than the ISS, meaning smaller lightweight exercise devices will be needed.\nBut problems keeping fit aside, just what does spaceflight do to the human body?\nMuscles and bones\nWithout the constant tug of gravity on our limbs, muscle and bone mass quickly begins to diminish in space. The most affected are those\u00a0muscles that help to maintain our posture\u00a0in our back, neck, calves and quadriceps \u2013 in microgravity they no longer have to work nearly as hard and begin to atrophy. After just two weeks\u00a0muscle mass can fall by as much as 20%\u00a0and on longer missions of three-to-six months it can fall by 30%.\nSimilarly, because astronauts are not putting their skeletons through as much mechanical strain as they do when subject to Earth's gravity, their bones also start to demineralise and lose strength. Astronauts can lose 1-2% of their bone mass every month they spend in space and up to 10% over a six-month period (on Earth, older men and women lose bone mass at a rate of 0.5%-1% every year). This can increase their risk of suffering fractures and increase the amount of time it takes to heal. It can take up to four years for their bone mass to return to normal after returning to Earth.\nTo combat this, astronauts undertake 2.5 hours a day of exercise and intense training while in orbit on the ISS. This includes a series of squats, deadlifts, rows and bench presses using a resistive exercise device installed in the ISS's \"gym\", alongside regular bouts tethered to a treadmill and on an exercise bike. They also take diet supplements to help keep their bones as healthy as possible.\nA recent study, however, highlighted that even this exercise regime was not enough to prevent losses in muscle function and size. It recommended testing whether higher loads in resistance exercises and high intensity interval training might help to counteract this muscle loss.\nThe lack of gravity pulling down on their bodies can also mean that astronauts find they grow a little taller during their stay on the ISS as their spines elongate slightly. This can lead to issues such as back pain while in space and slipped disks once back on Earth. During a briefing onboard the ISS ahead of his return to Earth, Rubio himself said his spine was growing and said it might help him to avoid a common neck injury that astronauts can suffer when their spacecraft hit the ground if they try to crane out of their seats to see what is happening.\n\"I think my spine has extended just enough that I'm kind of wedged into my seat liner, so I shouldn't move much at all,\" he said.\nWeight loss\nAlthough weight means very little while in orbit \u2013 the microgravity environment means anything not tethered down can float around the ISS habitat freely, including human bodies \u2013 maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge while in orbit. Although Nasa tries to ensure its astronauts have a diverse range of nutritious foods, including most recently a few salad leaves grown on board the space station, it can still affect an astronaut's body. Scott Kelly, a Nasa astronaut who took part in the most extensive study of the effects of long-term spaceflight after staying onboard the ISS for 340 days while his twin brother stayed back on Earth, lost 7% of his body mass while in orbit.\nEyesight\nOn Earth, gravity helps to force the blood in our bodies downward while the heart pumps it up again. In space, however, this process becomes messed up (although the body does adapt somewhat), and blood can accumulate in the head more than it normally would. Some of this fluid can pool at the back of the eye and around the optic nerve, leading to oedema. This can lead to changes in vision such as decreased sharpness and structural changes in the eye itself. These changes can start to occur after just two weeks in space but as that time goes on, the risk increases. Some of the vision changes reverse within about a year of astronauts returning to Earth, but others can be permanent.\nExposure to galactic cosmic rays and energetic solar particles can also lead to other eye problems. The Earth's atmosphere helps to protect us from these but once in orbit on the ISS, this protection disappears. While spacecraft can carry shielding to help keep out excess radiation, astronauts onboard the ISS have reported seeing flashes of light in their eyes as cosmic rays and solar particles hit their retina and optical nerves.\nNeural shuffling\nAfter his long stay on the ISS, however, Kelly's cognitive performance was found to have changed little and had remained relatively the same as his brother's on the ground. However, researchers did notice that the speed and accuracy of Kelly's cognitive performance did decrease for around six months after he landed, possibly as his brain readjusted to the Earth's gravity and his very different lifestyle back home.\nA study on a Russian cosmonaut who spent 169 days on the ISS in 2014 also revealed some changes to the brain itself seem to occur while in orbit. It found there were changes in the levels of neural connectivity in parts of the brain relating to motor function \u2013 in other words, movement \u2013 and also in the vestibular cortex, which plays an important role in orientation, balance and perception of our own motion. This is perhaps unsurprising given the peculiar nature of weightlessness while in space; astronauts often have to learn how to move efficiently without gravity to anchor them to anything and adjust to a world where there is no up or down.\nA more recent study has raised concerns about other changes in brain structure that can occur during long-term space missions. Cavities in the brain known as the right lateral and third ventricles (responsible for storing cerebrospinal fluid, providing nutrients to the brain and disposing of waste) can swell and take up to three years to shrink back to normal size.\nFriendly bacteria\nIt is apparent from research in recent years that a significant key to good health is the make up and diversity of the microorgansims that live in and on our bodies. This microbiota can influence how we digest food, affect the levels of inflammation in our bodies and even alter the way our brains work.\nResearchers examining Kelly after his trip to the ISS found that the bacteria and fungi living in his gut had altered profoundly compared to before he flew into space. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given the very different food he was eating and the change in the people he spent his days with (we obtain a horrifying amount of gut and oral microorganisms from the people we live alongside). But exposure to radiation and the use of recycled water, along with changes to his physical activity could all also have played a role. (Find out more about how exercise affects your gut microbes.)\nSkin\nAlthough there have now been five Nasa astronauts who have spent more than 300 days in orbit, we have Kelly to thank again for insights into how his skin fared while in orbit. His skin was found to have heightened sensitivity and a rash for around six days after he returned from the space station. Researchers speculated that a lack of skin stimulation during the mission may have contributed to his skin complaint.\nGenes\n\nOne of the most significant findings from Kelly's prolonged journey into space were the effects it had on his DNA. At the end of each strand of DNA are structures known as telomeres, which are thought to help protect our genes from damage. As we age, these get shorter, but research on Kelly and other astronauts has revealed that space travel seems to alter the length of these telomeres.\n\"Most striking, however, was the finding of significantly longer telomeres during spaceflight,\" says Susan Bailey, a professor of environmental and radiological health at Colorado State University who was part of the team studying Kelly and his brother. She has done separate studies with another 10 unrelated astronauts who have taken part in shorter missions of around six months. \"Also unexpected was that telomere length shortened rapidly on return to Earth for all crewmembers. Of particular relevance to long-term health and ageing trajectories, astronauts in general had many more short telomeres after spaceflight than they did before.\"\nExactly why this happens is still being unravelled, she says. \"We have some clues, but additional long-duration crewmembers \u2013 like Rubio, who spent one year in space \u2013 will be critical to really characterising and understanding this response and its potential health outcomes.\"\nOne possible cause could be exposure to the complex mix of radiation while in space. Astronauts who experience long-term exposure while in orbit show signs of DNA damage, she says.\nThere were also some changes in gene expression \u2013 the mechanism that reads the DNA to produce proteins in cells \u2013 seen in Kelly that may have been related to his journey into space. Some of these related to the body's response to DNA damage, bone formation and the immune system's response to stress. Most of these changes, however, had returned to normal within six months of his return to Earth.\nIn June 2024, a new study highlighted some potential differences between the way the immune systems of male and female astronauts respond to spaceflight. Using gene expression data from samples obtained from the crew of the SpaceX Inspiration 4 mission, who spent just under three days in orbit in the autumn of 2021, it identified changes in 18 proteins related to the immune system, ageing and muscle growth.\nComparing their gene activity to those of 64 other astronauts on previous missions, the study found in the expression of three proteins that play a role in inflammation compared to before the flight. The men tended to be more sensitive to spaceflight, with more disruption to their gene activity and they took longer to return to a normal state after returning to Earth.\nIn particular, the researchers found the gene activity of two proteins known as interleukin-6, which helps to control levels of inflammation in the body, and interleukin-8, which is produced to gulde immune cells to sites of infection, were more affected in the men compared to the women. Another protein, called firbrinogen, which is involved in blood clotting, was also affected more in male astronauts.\nBut the researchers say they still need to unravel why women appear to be less sensitive to these particular effects of spaceflight, but it could be related to their response to stress.\nYou can hear Nasa astronaut Peggy Whitson describe how her own time in space has changed her body in the video below. With an accumulated 675 days in space, she has spent more time in orbit than any other American, although the world record is currently held by Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who has clocked up 878 days in space.\nImmune system\n\nKelly received a series of vaccines before, during and after his trip into space and his immune system\u00a0was found to react normally. But Bailey's research has found that astronauts do suffer some decreases in white blood cell counts that fall in line with the doses of radiation they receive while in orbit.\nThere are still many questions to be answered, however, about what impact space travel can have on a bipedal, big-brained species that evolved to live on Earth. As researchers pour over Rubio's medical tests, blood samples and scans following his 371 days in space, they will doubtless be hoping they will learn more.\n* This article was originally published on 27 September 2023.

        "article_text": "Some may use yoga mats and virtual reality headsets to mentally escape the daily grind but now statisticians are using them to chart the rising cost of living.\nBoth items have made their way into the basket of goods and services used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to calculate inflation.\nThe basket contains 752 items. The ONS collects the costs of these products and services across many different retailers to come up with the monthly inflation figures.\nThat figure, currently showing prices rising at 3% a year, is a crucial economic measure which influences the cost of borrowing - interest rates - as well as rises in benefits and pensions or to form part of pay negotiations.\nThe contents of this huge basket of goods and services is reviewed every year to ensure it gives an accurate cross-section and weighting of our spending data.\nBut what is added or removed each time also gives us a fascinating insight into our changing tastes, trends and lifestyles.\nFor example, wild rabbit was one item included in the first list of 1947. Tea bags only made it in by 1980.\nThis time around, 23\u202fitems have been added and 15 removed\u202f from the basket.\nStephen Burgess, from the ONS, said: \"Our inflation basket of goods shows how consumer spending has evolved over the years.\n\"The addition of virtual reality headsets for the first time shows our appetite for emerging technology.

Pulled pork has also substituted an oven-ready gammon joint.\nMango is an addition to the selection of fruit, and cushions are in to bolster the underrepresented area of soft lounge furnishings.\nOn the other side of the ledger, a reflection of the falling circulation and prominence of newspapers means adverts in the local rag have been removed.\nThe ONS said anecdotal evidence suggests many of these pitches were now found on online platforms instead.\nLast year, vinyl records returned following a 30-year absence. Air fryers were also added, but hand sanitiser - a must-have of the Covid years - was taken out.\nDanni Hewson, head of financial analysis at the investment platform AJ Bell, said while changing fashions may be amusing, it was important to remember why this basket matters.\n\"It gives us a crucial economic indicator of what's happening with prices, a data set that helps Bank of England rate setters determine their next steps and a measure used to work out how much benefits, pensions and train tickets should go up by,\" she said.",

        "article_text": "A Palestinian student activist, who was detained by US immigration officers earlier this month, has spoken out for the first time about his arrest.\nIn a letter dictated over the phone to his family from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, Mahmoud Khalil said he is a \"political prisoner\" and that he believes he was targeted for \"exercising my right to free speech\".\nBorn in Syria, Mr Khalil is a green card holder and recent graduate of Columbia University. He was a prominent figure during the Gaza war protests on campus in the spring of 2024.\nHis arrest has been linked to President Donald Trump's promise to crack down on student demonstrators he accuses of \"un-American activity.\"\nTrump has alleged repeatedly that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, group designated as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest \"the first of many to come\".\nThe day after, Mr Khalil's arrest, Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed the administration's stance, posting on X: \"We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"\nThe 30-year-old's lawyers have argued that he was exercising free speech rights to demonstrate in support of Palestinians in Gaza and against US support for Israel. They accused the government of \"open repression of student activism and political speech\".\nIn his letter, released Tuesday, Mr Khalil said he believes he was arrested because he \"advocated for a free Palestine\".\nHe also detailed his arrest, saying he and his wife were \"accosted\" on their way home from dinner by Department of Homeland Security agents \"who refused to provide a warrant\".\n\"Before I knew what was happening, agents handcuffed me and forced me into an unmarked car,\" he said, adding that he was not told anything for hours, including the cause for his arrest.\nMr Khalil said he spent the night at 26 Federal Plaza, a federal office building in New York that includes an immigration court. Later, he was transported to a detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he said he was refused a blanket and forced to sleep on the ground.\nHe was transferred again to a detention facility in Louisiana, where he remains in custody. Mr Khalil's lawyers have been in court since to fight for his release.\nLast week, his lawyers pushed to bring him back to New York and accused the Trump administration of attempting to restrict access to their client. The judge did not issue a ruling at the hearing, but directed prosecutors to prove why the case should take place elsewhere.\nIn his letter, Mr Khalil called his detention \"unjust\" and said it was \"indicative of the anti-Palestinian racism that both the Biden and Trump administrations have demonstrated over the past 16 months.\"\nHe added that both administrations have \"continued to supply Israel with weapons to kill Palestinians and prevented international intervention\". He noted Israel's resumption of air strikes on Gaza on Monday night that killed 400, according to the Hamas-run health authority.\nMr Khalil also took aim at Columbia University's leadership for its disciplining of pro-Palestinian students, saying that the school's actions laid the groundwork for students like him to be targeted.\nColumbia University has stated that law enforcement can enter campus property with a warrant, but the school denied that university leadership had invited ICE agents.\nAmid the protests early last year, Mr Khalil was briefly suspended from the university, after police swarmed the campus following the occupation of a building.\nAt the time, he told the BBC that while he was acting as a key protest negotiator with Columbia officials, he had not participated directly in the student encampment because he was worried it could affect his student visa.\nBack then, he said that he would continue protesting. But more recently, Mr Khalil's wife said her husband had grown worried about deportation, after facing online attacks that \"were simply not based in reality\".\nShe said he sent Columbia University an email asking for urgent legal help on 7 March, the day before immigration agents arrested him. Mr Khalil's wife, who is a US citizen, is now eight months pregnant.\nThe White House has continued to defend its move.\n\"This administration is not going to tolerate individuals having the privilege of studying in our country and then siding with pro-terrorist organisations that have killed Americans,\" said Karoline Leavitt, Trump's press secretary.\nMr Khalil said his story is a warning to others in the US, saying it is part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration to \"suppress dissent.\"\n\"Visa-holders, green-card carriers, and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs,\" he warned.",

        "article_text": "Protests have erupted in Turkey after authorities detained the mayor of Istanbul, just days before he was due to be selected as a presidential candidate.\nEkrem Imamoglu, from the secular Republican People's Party (CHP), is seen as one of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's strongest political rivals.\nProsecutors accused him of corruption and aiding a terrorist group, calling him a \"criminal organisation leader suspect\".\nPolice detained 100 people - including other politicians, journalists and businessmen - as part of the investigation, and the Istanbul governor's office has imposed four days of restrictions in the city.\nImamoglu said online \"the will of the people cannot be silenced\". \nProtesters have taken to the streets and university campuses, and in underground stations, with crowds chanting anti-government slogans. It is a display of public anger not seen in years.\nThere were reports of clashes between protesters and police in Turkey's largest city. Footage from Reuters news agency shows police using pepper spray to disperse crowds outside Istanbul University.\nThousands of people rallied in the cold in front of the city hall, shouting: \"Erdogan, dictator!\" and \"Imamoglu, you are not alone!\"\nThe government has banned public gatherings in Istanbul as part of the four days of restrictions. But more protests are anticipated nationwide as opposition leaders, including Imamoglu's wife, urge people to \"raise their voices\".\nMany streets in Istanbul have also been closed to traffic, while some metro lines have also cancelled their services.\nIn a social media video Imamoglu said he filmed while police were outside his home, he vowed to \"stand resolute\" for the people of Turkey \"and all who uphold democracy and justice worldwide\".\nAnd in a handwritten note posted on his X account after his arrest, he said the people of Turkey would respond to \"the lies, the conspiracies and the traps\" against him.\nUK-based internet watchdog Netblocks said on Wednesday Turkey had severely restricted access to social media sites like X, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.\nThe arrest comes as part of a major crackdown nationwide in recent months, targeting opposition politicians, municipalities, journalists and figures in the entertainment industry.\nFollowing the Istanbul mayor's arrest, concerns over Turkey's shift toward autocracy were expressed on social media, with some calling for an opposition boycott of the upcoming presidential elections, arguing that a fair and democratic vote is no longer possible.\nImamoglu's party, the CHP, even condemned the arrests as \"a coup against our next president\", a sentiment widely echoed by pro-opposition voices.\nBut Turkey's justice minister criticised those who linked Erdogan to the arrests. \nYilmaz Tunc said it was \"extremely dangerous and wrong\" to suggest this was a political move, insisting that nobody was above the law in Turkey.\nErdogan and his party have also denied the claims, insisting that Turkey's judiciary is independent. He has been in power for 22 years.\nLast year, Imamoglu won a second term as Istanbul's mayor, when his CHP party swept local elections there and in Ankara. \nIt was the first time since Erdogan came to power that his party was defeated across the country at the ballot box.\nThe elections were also a personal blow to the president, who grew up in and became mayor of Istanbul on his rise to power. \nDozens of police officers were involved in the early-morning raid on Imamoglu's house in Istanbul.\nThe CHP's presidential candidate selection, in which Imamoglu is the only person running, is set to take place on Sunday.\nImamoglu's arrest came a day after Istanbul University annulled his degree due to alleged irregularities - a decision which, if upheld, would prevent him from running in presidential elections. \nAccording to the Turkish constitution, presidents must have completed higher education to hold office.\nImamoglu called that move \"legally baseless\", adding that universities \"must remain independent, free from political interference and dedicated to knowledge\".\nPresidential elections are currently scheduled for 2028. Erdogan cannot currently run for office again, as he is in his second term and previously served as prime minister before that. \nThe only way Erdogan could contest another election would be to change the constitution, or call an early election before his term ends. \nAs well as being accused of extortion and fraud, Imamoglu is also alleged to have aided the PKK.\nThe PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - has waged an insurgency since 1984, and is proscribed as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US.\nEarlier this month the group announced its decision to lay down arms, following a call from its imprisoned leader, who had engaged in talks with Turkish officials.\nInternational reaction to the arrest has been negative, with EU, French and German officials all condemning the arrests. \nA Council of Europe statement said the detention of Imamoglu \"bears all the hallmarks of the pressure on a political figure considered as one of the main candidates in forthcoming presidential elections.\"\nThe Turkish lira, meanwhile, briefly crashed to an all-time low against the US dollar, as markets reacted poorly to the political uncertainty.\nWhile many were shocked to wake up to the news of Imamoglu's arrest, legal pressure on the popular opposition leader is far from new.\nHe has faced multiple investigations and was handed a political ban in December 2022 over allegations of insulting Turkey's electoral board in 2019 - a verdict he appealed, with the final ruling still pending.\nAdditionally, he has been the subject of cases related to alleged tender irregularities during his tenure as mayor of Istanbul's Beylikduzu district.\nMore recently, on 20 January, a new case was filed against him over his criticism of a prosecutor.",

'A coup against our next president'The arrest comes as part of a major crackdown nationwide in recent months, targeting opposition politicians, municipalities, journalists and figures in the entertainment industry.Following the Istanbul mayor's arrest, concerns over Turkey's shift toward autocracy were expressed on social media, with some calling for an opposition boycott of the upcoming presidential elections, arguing that a fair and democratic vote is no longer possible.Imamoglu's party, the CHP, even condemned the arrests as \"a coup against our next president\", a sentiment widely echoed by pro-opposition voices.But Turkey's justice minister criticised those who linked Erdogan to the arrests.",

        "article_text": "Until just over a week ago, Artem Kariakin and his unit were making regular trips across Ukraine's border into the Russian town of Sudzha.\nHe shows me video taken with a phone of their very last trip, as Ukrainian forces retreated from Russia's Kursk region. It shows them making their way past dozens of burnt out military and civilian vehicles.\nA soldier armed with a shotgun, their last line of defence, scans the horizon for Russian drones. Out of nowhere, one flies towards the back of their truck. Sparks fly, but they keep on going.\nArtem says they were lucky - the explosive charge was not big enough to stop them.\nAnother truck nearby was less fortunate. It was already in flames.\nArtem admits Ukraine's retreat from Sudzha, the largest town Ukraine held in Kursk, was \"not well organised\".\n\"It was pretty chaotic,\" he tells me. \"Many units left in disarray. I think the problem was the order to withdraw came too late.\"\nIt wasn't helped, he says, because units were operating without proper communications. The Starlink satellite systems they normally rely on didn't work inside Russia.\nThe 27-year-old soldier still views the Kursk offensive as broadly successful. Artem says it forced Russia to divert its forces from the east. Most of Ukraine's troops still managed to escape in time \u2013 even if for many it was on foot.\nBut he believes Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russian territory, launched last August, was too deep and too narrow - relying on just one main road for supplies and reinforcements.\nWhile Artem and his men were fleeing for their lives, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were talking by phone about trying to bring the war to an end. Artem says he finds that \"absurd\".\n\"To me these calls between Trump and Putin are just surreal,\" he says. \"Trump wants to end the war because he promised to do it - and Putin wants to deceive Trump to continue his war. I can't take their conversations seriously.\"\nArtem, whose home is in the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, tells me he feels disappointed with the US and Trump. \"What can I feel when they just want to give away my home?\"\nArtem says he never believed that Putin would be willing to trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories. But he still believes the Kursk offensive was important to protect its own border. Ukrainian troops may have been forced to retreat, but they still occupy high ground just over the border with Sumy.\nUkraine is continuing its cross-border raids \u2013 not just into Kursk, but Belgorod too. \nSerhiy's assault battalion helps plan these attacks \u2013 finding a way through Russian minefields and anti-tank obstacles known as \"dragon's teeth\".\nWe joined him on a night-time mission to locate and recover armoured vehicles in need of repairs. It's the safest time to move close to the Russian border.\nSerhiy himself is no stranger to Russia: he was born there. He now has Belorussian citizenship, but he chose to fight for Ukraine. He justifies Ukraine's incursions into his former home. Russia too, he says, has been trying to create a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory.\nTravelling in his Ukrainian-made armoured vehicle, Serhiy still lists the likely threats, now we are less than 10km from the Russian border: glide bombs, rockets and artillery, and drones fitted with thermal imaging cameras.\nHis own vehicle is fitted with electronic counter-measures to jam enemy drones, but even those won't work against drones operated via fibre optic wires. Those can't be stopped, though on some routes Ukraine has now erected netting to try to catch the drones before they can hit their target.\nOur original search near the Russian border for a damaged US-made Bradley armoured vehicle is abandoned when Serhiy receives intelligence that Russian drones are operating nearby. Instead, he tries to locate another broken-down Bradley where the risks will be smaller.\nHe and his driver still have to overcome obstacles along the way. Trees and branches lie strewn across their path \u2013 remnants from a recent Russian air strike. We see several more explosions in the distance, briefly turning the night sky orange.\nSerhiy eventually finds his broken-down Bradley. It's already been retrieved from the battlefield across the border and has been loaded onto a lorry to be taken back for repairs.\nThe Bradley commander confirms to me that they've been fighting in Russia. He describes the situations across the border as \"difficult, but we're holding on\".\nThe Bradley is another reminder of Ukraine's reliance on US military support. That now seems less certain with Trump's focus on peace talks. Serhiy says it's already clear to him that there's \"haggling behind Ukraine's back\".\nI ask Serhiy if he thinks European nations can fill any void left by the US. Is a European \"coalition of the willing\" enough to guarantee Ukraine's security? \n\"I think if America doesn't help Ukraine, then a ceasefire will be agreed soon - but on extremely unfavourable terms for Ukraine,\" Serhiy replies.\n\"Europe clearly cannot resolve this conflict alone. They're not strong enough. They've been focussing on their own economies instead of thinking about security.\"\nSerhiy says he wants the war to end. Like many Ukrainians, he would like to see peace - but not at any price.\nAdditional reporting by Volodymyr Lozkho and Anastasiia Levchenko",

What drove his obsession with mass killings and how was he stopped from committing further atrocities?\nProsper, 19, is beginning a life sentence for murdering his mother Juliana Falcon, 48; his brother Kyle, 16, and sister Giselle, 13, at their flat on Luton's Marsh Farm estate.\nAt Luton Crown Court, he was told he must serve at least 49 years in jail.\nHowever, the death toll could have been even higher were it not for the vigilance of the police officers who spotted and arrested Prosper before he could enact plans to murder primary school pupils and staff.\nA senior detective described that as a \"sliding doors moment\", while one of the arresting officers said the knowledge he had prevented further killings was \"very overwhelming\".\nSentencing, Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told Prosper: \"You intended to unleash disaster on the community of Luton. Your plans were intelligent, calculating and selfish. Your ambition was notoriety.\"\nShe paid tribute to Prosper's family, saying \"their deaths are almost certain to have saved the lives of many children\", as it was a neighbour who called police after hearing the disturbance.\nWarning: This story contains distressing details\nProsper killed his victims in the early hours of Friday, 13 September last year.\nAn inquest heard each had gunshot wounds to the head. Kyle had more than 100 knife wounds. Giselle had been shot in the face.\nIt was the first phase of an intended assault that had been a year in the planning.\nProsper planned to attack St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Gardenia Avenue, Luton, killing 30 young children and himself.\nThe date was no accident. He had chosen Friday the 13th \"so it had a good name on it\", the court heard, and had also designed a distinctive black and yellow outfit to wear.\n\"He wanted to be the most notorious and infamous person that's ever committed a school shooting,\" said Det Ch Insp Sam Khanna, of Bedfordshire Police.\n\"He knew numbers; he knew facts and figures, and he wanted to be responsible for the most number of casualties ever killed within a school.\"\nIn August 2023, Prosper made a booking at a shooting range, but did not attend.\nHowever, his online history gives an fuller insight into what drove him.\n\"There's a general theme of extreme violence; content which you can't believe is readily available on the internet,\" said Det Ch Insp Khanna.\n\"There's pretty much not a mass shooting event that he hadn't researched in detail.\n\"He had a fascination with the people that perpetrate such offences and had gone to great detail researching them, almost putting together fact-files of them.\"\nOne of those spree shootings was at Sandy Hook, the Connecticut elementary school where 26 people were killed in 2012.\nProsper was determined to murder more.\nThe BBC has previously reported he was banned from a website featuring videos of people's final moments, after making pro-paedophile comments. \nBy April 2024, he became a member of an online gun sales website, and three months later began researching how to fake a firearms certificate.\nHe then turned to researching his former primary school.\nPolice found no evidence he had a bad time there or bore any grudge, rather that his first-hand knowledge \"would make his plan that much easier\", said Det Ch Insp Khanna.\nIn August, Prosper tried and failed in his first attempt to buy a gun.\nHowever, later that month he contacted another seller on a legal gun sales site, paying \u00a3650 plus \u00a330 petrol money to the man for a shotgun and 100 cartridges.\n\"He basically created a legend of himself to make any would-be seller feel comfortable,\" said Det Ch Insp Khanna. \n\"He went to the lengths of talking about working for a charity as a volunteer to gain the confidence of the seller.\"\nHe researched the logos, signatures and even the type of paper licences were printed on to fool the seller, who police found had committed no offence.\n\"It is a fake, but possibly only an expert would know that,\" said Det Ch Insp Khanna.\nPrivate gun sellers need to inform police of any sale, and the person who sold the shotgun to Prosper did this on 12 September.\nBecause this was done out-of-hours on the day before the killings, there was no opportunity for anyone to realise the gun had been sold to someone who was not a legitimate licence-holder, said Det Ch Insp Khanna.\n\"This can't be allowed to happen again... the Bedfordshire deputy chief constable is engaging with national parties to try and look at this and see what learning can come from it,\" he added.\nThe court heard Prosper planned to shoot and rape Giselle, but his mother \"messed it up\" by waking up.\nKyle hid in the kitchen and \"began pleading for his life\" during the attacks.\nMarium Abbas lived in a flat above theirs. In the early hours of 13 September, she awoke to banging and a \"strange voice which I've never heard, never experienced, in my life\".\nShe went outside her door and saw a neighbour. They discussed calling police, but concluded they did not know what they would tell them.\nLater, officers surrounded the building and Ms Abbas learned of the horror that had unfolded beneath her.\nDespite since being reassured by friends, she said she still felt \"guilty\" and struggled to be alone.\n\"I feel like maybe if I knew what was happening; if I went downstairs; maybe he would have shot me but the children would have been saved,\" she said.\nAfter the killings Prosper went on the run. His arrest, soon afterwards, was a \"sliding doors moment\", said Det Ch Insp Khanna, referring to the film in which a moment of chance becomes pivotal.\nTwo officers returning from the scene to the police station spotted a man whose \"whole behaviour was off\".\n\"Nothing was really said in the car,\" recalled one. \"I think we kind of had the same instinct... 'This seems related.'\n\"As we get closer, we start to see what appears to be blood over his face. At that moment, we believe he was our suspect. \n\"We got him into handcuffs. He just kept on saying 'It's not murder, it's not murder.'\"\nOfficers found a shotgun and 33 cartridges in a nearby bush.\nThe officer said when he learned the extent of Prosper's plans, it was \"very overwhelming knowing that it was me and my crewmate that managed to prevent this from happening\".\nProsper made disclosures to a prison nurse four days after the killings, and also produced two written plans in jail.\n\"Very unusually for most of our cases, he has been talking,\" said Det Ch Insp Khanna.\n\"In terms of why we think he's done this, it's purely around notoriety and wanting to be known for a significant horrific offence and event. \n\"Normally we get people in his position that don't talk and wait for the legal process to go through, but that's the opposite we found with the offender.\"\nThere is no evidence to suggest Prosper was seeking to advance a political or ideological cause. \nHe was not charged with terrorism offences, and nor was he known to the government anti-terrorism programme Prevent.\nHis parents were separated, but both of them and his school had concerns about Prosper and he was referred to a GP.\nBut he refused to engage and that went no further. \nNHS Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes Integrated Care Board NHS has declined to comment, while East London NHS Foundation Trust, which provides mental health services in the area, said Prosper was not under its care.\nWhile in prison, a forensic psychiatrist assessed Prosper as having autistic spectrum disorder traits, but he has not been officially diagnosed.\nHowever, it was determined that it was not these traits that drove his actions; rather, his desire to become infamous and a lack of empathy for others.\nProsper also had a number of indecent images of children on his phone, but because of the severity of the other charges he faced, the Crown Prosecution Service decided against a specific charge on these.\nAt Prosper's first court appearance, his father Ray Prosper shouted: \"I still love you, son. It's not your fault, OK?\" and then wept.\nAt the sentencing hearing, a statement he wrote was read out on his behalf. \n\"When I heard the horrendous news that day, part of my soul died too. This is a lose-lose situation for us all and we have lost four family members,\" he wrote.\nDet Ch Insp Khanna said: \"We're used to going and seeing families and loved ones at the most challenging of times and telling them that unfortunately they've lost a member of their family.\n\"For the offender's father, he's lost two of his children. He's lost his ex-wife, who he still had a good relationship with, and this has been perpetrated by his own son.\"\nHe said police were supporting family members, but added: \"I think it would take a long time before anyone can come to terms with what's happened.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "article_text": "Geovany Quenda signed for Chelsea from Sporting this week for \u00a342m\nTransfers in March? \nShould we be surprised when Chelsea sign two young players for a combined \u00a362m outside of the transfer window... or is this just the latest quirk of the club hierarchy's unquenching appetite for deals?\nSporting winger Geovany Quenda, 17, will join the Blues in 2026, while midfielder Dario Essugo, 20, will move this summer to deputise for Moises Caicedo. \nA recent Uefa report declared Chelsea's 2024 squad was \"comfortably the most expensive ever assembled\", 24% higher than the previous record by Real Madrid in 2020.\nThe report also says Chelsea spent almost 2bn euros (\u00a31.7bn) in transfer fees in the five-year period to 2024.\nAnd yet they keep spending.\nSeveral other teenagers are lined up to join Chelsea in the next few transfer windows, for fees worth more than \u00a3150m in total.\nThey include: \nMidfielder Kendry Paez, 17, who is already training with the Blues, and will complete a \u00a317m move in the summer\n18-year-old winger Estevao Willian, who is expected to join after the Club World Cup for \u00a329m - potentially rising to \u00a351m with add-ons, according to sources in Brazil \n19-year-old goalkeeper Mike Penders, who will join from Genk for \u00a317m in the summer \nAnd 19-year-old defender Mamadou Sarr, after an \u00a311.9m deal was agreed with partner club Strasbourg in January.\nQuenda, Essugo, Paez, Estevao, Penders and Sarr may all be exciting talents - but what is the masterplan at Stamford Bridge, and how can they afford it?\nBuy young stars on lower wages, spread the payments over long contracts, keep flipping players and sell on unwanted talent for a profit - that is Chelsea's strategy in a nutshell. Oh, and try to win things at the same time.\nWith an average age of 23 years and five months, the Blues already have the youngest squad in the Premier League - and it is set to get even younger from next season. \nThe club has had a radical shift in transfer strategy since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital took over from Roman Abramovich in 2022. \nMost Abramovich-era players have been sold in an attempt to reduce the age of the squad - and the wage bill. \nThat money has then been reinvested in young talent in what appears to be a 'supercharged Brighton' approach to transfer business. \nYoung players are being signed on long contracts, usually between seven and nine years, for reasons which co-owner Boehly explained at last month's FT Business of Football event.\n\"It is the way this market operates,\" the American billionaire said. \"I don't see it as good or bad. \n\"You always focus on how you keep something together for a very long time. How? You identify a younger portfolio of players to be consistent and reliable over a long period of time - and that's an option that's valuable...\n\"A seven-year contract is really a five-year contract as 90% of the time you have to make a decision or shoot yourself in the foot [with a player trying to run down their contract]. \n\"You either agree terms, or shoot yourself in the foot, or agree there are greener pastures out there.\"\nA recent CIES Football Observatory report, external revealed Chelsea are the best performing team in world football when measuring how many minutes (almost 92%) are being played by players under contracts beyond 2026.\nIn other words - the clubs where squad planning is \"most likely to bring stability\" in the coming years or to \"generate substantial capital gains\" from transfers.\nChelsea are clearly betting on a host of highly rated youngsters from across the globe in the hope they will unearth more stars like Cole Palmer or Nicolas Jackson. \nThey also want to beat clubs like Benfica to rising stars in markets like South America to avoid paying a 'Portuguese premium', like they did when signing Enzo Fernandez for \u00a3107m in 2023. \n\"We knew there was going to be a big transition,\" Chelsea co-sporting director Paul Winstanley said in 2023. \"No chance to sit back and relax, that's for sure. Did we think we would oversee a Premier League record of transactions? Probably not.\" \nThat constant desire to trade players has slowed down a little after a series of record-breaking transfer windows in terms of both volume and spending.\nThe accounting model makes some sense as the long contracts and amortisation - spreading the cost of a transfer over an extended period - have enabled Chelsea to get players like Caicedo on comparatively 'lower' \u00a3180,000-a-week wages, despite him costing a British transfer record \u00a3115m when joining in 2023 from Brighton. \nUkraine winger Mykhailo Mudryk - who joined Chelsea for up to \u00a389m, inclusive of add-ons, from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2023 - is on 'just' \u00a397,000 a week on a contract running to 2031. He is one example of how players can spread lower baseline earnings across a longer deal.\nBut there can be issues with those lengthier contracts. \nMudryk is currently suspended after testing positive for a banned substance. If found guilty, he could face up to a four-year ban, while still having years on his Chelsea deal.\nAnd then what if a player wants out? On the Overlap podcast, Jamie Carragher asked whether any club could afford to buy Chelsea's star man Palmer.\nLast year, the playmaker renewed his contract until 2033, but Carragher said he can see the 22-year-old's \"frustration\" with some underperforming team-mates.\n\"It reminded me of Stevie [Gerrard] at Liverpool at times, because he was so much better than everyone else and he got frustrated. Stevie was a local player, but he was never going to leave, whereas Cole Palmer isn't. \n\"This is when I go back to those eight-year contracts, and whether they are good for the club and players. \n\"If you're Palmer, who's got six or seven years left on his deal, and he should be playing for a team looking to win the Champions League, how does he get out?\"\nThis is uncharted territory and, although it makes sense on a balance sheet, is the human aspect being overlooked?\nThere are also young players like Cesare Casadei, Renato Veiga and Carney Chukwuemeka who all left Chelsea in January amid various frustrations about a lack of minutes available, with multiple young stars all vying for the same roles. \nForward Christopher Nkunku, who was made available to other clubs in January - and other players such as midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who only joined last summer - face uncertainty before the next transfer window.\nChelsea sources continue to insist they have no issues with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules (PSR) and have yet to fall foul of them under this ownership.\nHowever, it took what was described as a 'fire sale' of talent and the sale of two hotels to a sister company to continue adhering to the financial controls. \nChelsea have also been involved in a couple of so-called 'PSR swap deals' - with academy talent Ian Maatsen moving to Aston Villa as Omari Kellyman joined the Blues.\nQualifying for the Champions League would also help bolster the club's finances - and a major factor behind playing without a front-of-shirt sponsor is that the Blues are waiting to qualify for Europe's premier competition to negotiate a better rate. \nAnother positive on the horizon for Chelsea's finances is their involvement in this summer's expanded Club World Cup in the United States, when they are expected to receive more than \u00a350m to take part.\nIt is unlikely, therefore, that any marquee players will be sold but academy defender Trevoh Chalobah is still expected to leave to create more PSR headroom in the summer.\nKieron O'Connor, who writes the Swiss Ramble football finance blog, told BBC Sport: \"The only thing we know for sure with Chelsea's PSR situation is that they were compliant for the three-year monitoring period up to 2023-24, as the Premier League has confirmed that no clubs were in breach.\n\"Chelsea have not yet published their accounts for last season, but I reckon that the only way that they could have kept below the maximum \u00a3105m loss was by applying some fancy financial footwork.\n\"The expectation is they will have made a huge operating loss, as they did not qualify for Europe, while they have also struggled to replace shirt and sleeve sponsors. This will be partially offset by hefty player sales, but they will still need to find money elsewhere, such as the sale of the women's football club.\n\"The 2024-25 assessment will benefit from dropping the large 2021-22 loss, but compliance would still be dependent on the significant inter-company transactions. The big question is whether Uefa will also accept these exceptional credits, as their regulations are tighter than the Premier League's.\"\nWhere there is a real need to sell players is simply to get the squad numbers down as Chelsea look to move away from using loans for unwanted talent, like Ben Chilwell to Crystal Palace and Raheem Sterling to Arsenal, and instead try to develop young players at lower league and European clubs.\nChelsea believe within two loan spells they should be able to tell whether a young player is capable of making it at Stamford Bridge, and would look to sell a player quickly if they do not believe they can make the grade.\nDuring a vocal minority protest against the ownership at the recent match against Southampton, one common complaint was whether Chelsea could win trophies with a strategy similar to Brighton.\nIf Chelsea do not pay top-level wages, will the best players join the club? And doesn't experience count for something?\nChelsea's owners, and those close to them, have always highlighted their desire to win and ambitions to match expectations in the longer term. \nHowever, they want to do so with this current approach and have urged patience to wait for their players and this project to reach a mature stage. \nOne source suggested to BBC Sport that the project is at 'Everest Base Camp' - the starting point to climb the world's largest mountain.\nThose ambitions for major honours extend beyond just the Conference League, where Chelsea's squad was worth as much as the other 31 teams combined. \nSources close to senior players at Chelsea say they want stability having had three permanent managers and five including interim bosses across two seasons. \nAfter the 1-0 defeat by Arsenal at Emirates Stadium last weekend, Caicedo said \"they are working seven years together, and us just two years\". \nMaresca has also echoed those calls when explaining why Chelsea cannot be title contenders this season, pointing towards the time needed for Mikel Arteta, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp to build their imposing teams.  \nChelsea's ownership subscribe to that view and currently believe Maresca works within the project better than his predecessors Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel did, while getting better results than Graham Potter - who was sacked over results rather than a culture clash. \nHere are some fan views on the latest signings from the BBC Sport Chelsea page:\nGarry: Will either of them play in goal or as a striker then? I thought not. This is just more pointless stockpiling of young talent, with a view to cash in on potential demand further down the line. We are slowly becoming irrelevant as a club. I can't even be bothered to get annoyed with it all any more.\nClive: Off the back of rumours that we are going to be selling Enzo Fernandez, we have signed two more midfielders. That is OK, but where is the experienced and proven striker who is able to back up Nicolas Jackson and help his decision-making and scoring skills?\nNicholas: It's building a portfolio of players not building a team. I've become numb to the players coming into the club.\nTristan: These latest deals have summed up the Boehly ownership era, showing a lack of direction. When you think we are done spending too much money on young players, Boehly comes up trumps and spends insane amounts on players. Our ownership and management are equally poor - dramatic change is needed now.\nLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan views\nGet Chelsea news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Georgia beat Spain 46-28 on Sunday to win the Rugby Europe Championship for an eighth consecutive year\nGeorgia head coach Richard Cockerill believes his side have \"earned the right\" to face Wales in a play-off to decide which nation should be in the 2026 Six Nations.\nThe former England hooker says Georgia are good enough to play at Europe's highest level after clinching an eighth successive second-tier Rugby Europe Championship title.\nWinless Wales finished bottom of the Six Nations for the second year in a row and have not won a game since beating Georgia at the World Cup in 2023. \nThey lost to Georgia in Cardiff in autumn 2022.\n\"If you are finishing bottom of the Six Nations why do you just get free rein to turn up next year and play?\" said Cockerill.\n\"We want the opportunity to prove that we can compete, so surely that's logical we get the opportunity to have a play-off.\n\"It would be the richest game in World Rugby - Georgia versus Wales at some point in the near future to see who plays in the Six Nations for the next tournament. \n\"That's jeopardy, isn't it? That would be a game people would want to watch.\"\nWRU should have 'fronted up' after England loss - Davies\nWhere can Welsh rugby possibly go from here?\nGeorgia have risen to 11th in World Rugby's rankings - one place above Wales, who have dropped to the lowest position in their history after 17 consecutive Test defeats.\nThe former Leicester forward's side have now won 17 second-tier titles and he says they need a greater challenge.\n\"We feel we are probably a little bit too strong for this tournament although the other teams are improving, especially Spain and Romania, but for us to improve we need to play at a tougher level,\" the 54-year-old told the BBC Radio Wales Breakfast programme.\n\"We need to go and get challenged and we need to lose games. We need to lose games to know what it feels like to play at the level the Six Nations is at, as Italy had that opportunity in the early 2000s.\n\"We feel we've earned the right, not to be given that place, we want the opportunity to prove that potentially we're good enough to compete on a regular basis at that level.\"\nThis video can not be played\n'WRU must cut a region to solve Welsh rugby crisis' - Warburton\nCockerill does however admit the prospect of a play-off in the near future is unlikely. \n\"I don't think so. If you're in the Six Nations you wouldn't want to be voting for that type of play-off, would you?\" he added. \n\"Because it might be you, and the ramifications of not being in the Six Nations, from a rugby point of view but also from a financial point of view, would be very, very difficult.\n\"It's a bit like a Championship football club getting into the Premiership isn't it? You know it would be the richest game in world rugby. \n\"That would be a game people would want to watch and the money involved and the profile involved for Georgian rugby would catapult us into a completely different sphere if we were good enough to beat whoever finishes bottom.\n\"And if we lose, well we re-group, we keep developing and we fight for the opportunity to do that again. I don't see that as an unreasonable request.\"\nFormer England hooker and forwards coach Richard Cockerill was appointed head coach of Georgia in January 2024\nCockerill was part of England's coaching staff under Eddie Jones and led the team on an interim basis when the Australian was sacked in 2022.\nCurrently in charge of both the Georgian national team and the country's leading club side Black Lion, the former Leicester forward says he is not interested in Welsh rugby vacancies.\nThe Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) are looking for a new director of rugby as well as a full-time replacement for Warren Gatland, who left the Wales head coach role during the 2025 Six Nations.\n\"I think the Welsh job would be attractive for anybody,\" said Cockerill.\n\"It's a fantastic country with fantastic history, a country that loves its rugby. \n\"But whoever comes in next has got to be given time from top to bottom to develop the players that Wales need to be competitive because I think you look at the moment at players available for Wales, are they really good enough to be competing and being competitive in the Six Nations?\n\"I think honestly, and with all respect to everybody, I just think that they haven't quite got the quality at this point.\n\"They may grow into it with a lot of young players being in and around the squad, but they're not quite good enough at the moment so whoever comes in is going to need time - and we know in professional sport the one thing you don't get... is the opportunity to build a squad and settle in and build it from the ground up, which at the moment is probably where Wales is at.\"",

The accused have lived their lives,\" said Sanjay Chaudhry, whose cousin was killed in the firing.\nThirteen of the 17 men accused in the case have died in the 44 years since the crime was committed. Apart from the three men who have been sentenced to death, there is one more accused, who is absconding.\nThe crime took place on 18 November 1981, when 17 men - most of them from the upper caste - wearing police uniforms stormed Dehuli and started shooting at villagers.\nAccording to the police complaint registered at the time, the violence followed the murder of a Dalit member of the robbers' gang by his upper-caste colleagues. The gang members then attacked the village because they suspected that some Dalit villagers were providing information to the police in the murder case.\nThe survivors of the massacre have vivid memories of the day.\n\"I was doing household chores when suddenly the firing started,\" says Rakesh Kumar, a witness who was a teenager at the time. \n\"I was hiding behind a stack of paddy and when I came out, I saw that many people, including my mother, were shot,\" he said. \nMr Kumar's mother Chameli Devi, now 80, was hit by a bullet in her leg while running from the gunfire. \n\"They did not spare anyone, including women or children,\" she said. \"Whoever they found was killed.\"\nThe firing lasted for more than four hours and the attackers fled the scene before the police arrived, according to media reports. \nThe crime led to an exodus of Dalits from Dehuli, and the local administration sent police personnel to the village, where they stayed for months in a bid to reassure people. It also triggered a political uproar, and then prime minister Indira Gandhi had visited Dehuli to meet the victims.\nIn 1984, the case was transferred from a district court to the Allahabad Sessions Court on the orders of the state's high court. The trial continued there on and off until 2024, when the case was shifted to the special court in Mainpuri which found the men guilty. \nIt's not unusual for courts in India to take decades to finish hearing a case and deliver a verdict, especially when the victims are from disadvantaged communities. In 2023, a 90-year-old man was sentenced for life in prison for a caste crime that also took place in 1981.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

There are exceptions if the life or health of the pregnant patient is at risk, but not in cases of rape or incest.\nThe state's supreme court unanimously rejected a challenge last year from 20 women who said they were denied medically necessary abortions under Texas law.\nPaxton's office said Ms Rojas, who they allege is known as \"Dr Maria\", operated multiple clinics in north-west Houston.\nShe employed \"unlicensed individuals\" and performed \"illegal abortion procedures\", according to the allegations. \nAuthorities said they have filed a temporary restraining order to shut down the clinics.\nHolly Shearman, a midwife who runs a birth centre where Ms Rojas worked part-time, told the Texas Tribune that she was \"shocked\" by news of the arrest.\nAccording to the Texas-based news website, Ms Shearman said Ms Rojas was a devout Catholic who provided prenatal care to a primarily Spanish-speaking, low-income community. \n\"I don't believe it for one second,\" she said of the allegations.\nMs Rojas' arrest is believed to be one of the first criminal prosecutions under the Texas abortion ban. The state attorney general's office said she was taken into custody in Waller County, and it is unclear if she has a lawyer yet.\nLast year, Paxton's office filed a lawsuit against a New York-based abortion provider for allegedly posting abortion pills to a Texan. That same doctor was indicted earlier this year in the state on a charge of criminal abortion.  \nNew York has shield laws, which aim to protect providers who provide abortion to patients in other states. New York Gov Kathy Hochul has said the state has no plans to allow for Dr Margaret Daley Carpenter's extradition to Texas. \nShe called the case \"outrageous\" and said Republicans were trying to stymie access to abortion across the US.",

The paper's website adds: \"As things stand Russia has scored a diplomatic victory here.\"\nWhy are some in Russia claiming \"victory\" after this two-hour phone call?\nProbably because, by the end of it, Vladimir Putin hadn't been pressured into making any major concessions to Ukraine or to the United States. On the contrary, he had - in effect - rejected President Trump's idea of an immediate unconditional 30-day ceasefire.\nInstead of pressuring Moscow with the threat of even tougher sanctions and penalties, to get Russia to sign up to its plan, the US administration reacted by praising the Kremlin leader.\n\"We had a great call,\" Donald Trump told Fox News.\n\"I would commend President Putin for all he did today on that call to move his country close to a final peace deal,\" said Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff.\nNot only did Moscow not agree to an unconditional ceasefire, President Putin set his own pre-conditions for peace. \nThey include an end to Western military aid to Kyiv and intelligence sharing with the Ukrainians, as well as a halt to mobilisation in Ukraine.  Such conditions are widely viewed as a way of securing Ukraine's capitulation.\nIt's hard to see Kyiv agreeing to any of that.\nBut could the Trump administration eventually be persuaded, by Moscow, that such conditions are acceptable? And if so, would Washington force Ukraine to accept them?\nMuch may depend on whether the Kremlin can convince President Trump he has more to gain from developing good ties with Moscow than by defending Ukraine's corner.\nAs if to press home the point, in their conversations with the Americans, Russian officials are already dangling various economic and financial carrots and talking about how mutually beneficial the Russia-US relationship could be if the two countries can re-energise bilateral relations and get to work on joint projects.\nVladimir Putin recently raised the prospect of US-Russian cooperation in aluminium production and rare minerals mining.\nThe message appears to be getting through.\n\"We'd like to have more trade with Russia,\" said Donald Trump on Tuesday in his interview with Fox News.  \n\"They have some very valuable things for us, including rare earth. They have a big chunk of real estate, the biggest in the world. They have things that we could use.\"\nMoscow may well be hoping - possibly calculating - that Donald Trump will prioritise getting a chunk of that \"Russian real estate\" over securing an acceptable deal for Ukraine to end the war.\nIt's a point echoed today by the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper:\n\"Moscow's logic is to make economic relations with America so profitable that severing them would be too costly for the United States.\"\nAfter Ukraine had agreed to an unconditional ceasefire a week ago, the US administration publicly announced that \"the ball is in [Russia's] court\".\nNow that Vladimir Putin has rejected the deal and set his own conditions, the Kremlin leader has hit it back into America's \"court\".\nBut Russia and America will continue their discussions - both on Ukraine and on US-Russian ties.\nAnd it's these negotiations which are likely to influence Donald Trump's next move.",

        "article_text": "\"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream,\" says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y.\nBen is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go \u2013 because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees.\n\"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\"\nBen is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.\nMusk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\nFor some who do not share his views, it has all become too much. \nThere have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal. \nAlthough most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire.\nIn the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.\nUS President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".\nMusk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"\nWhat is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers. \nAnd if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?\nTwo decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.\nMusk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.\n\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"\nIt is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.\nNowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.\nLike the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.\nBut recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.\nAlthough its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.\nThe decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.\nThis year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia. \nMeanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.\nIn early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.\nSales can fall for many reasons, but research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.\nIn the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"\nTesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.\nBut experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.\nTo start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.\n\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"\nProf Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"\nCompetition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.\nAt the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.\n\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.\n\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"\nThe extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.\nMusk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.\nIn January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.\nIn 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.\n\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.\nArguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.\nAsked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".\n\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.\n\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"\nEver since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn.\nThat is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.\nFor those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.\nToday, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings \u2013 a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.\n\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers \u2013 or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.\nNone of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment \u2013  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.\nBut analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.\n\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"\n\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.\n\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "Viewers and critics have heaped praise on Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, with many hailing it as a landmark TV show.\nThe four-part British series was released last week and is the most-watched show on the platform around the world over the weekend.\nThe Times' Tom Peck described it as \"complete perfection\", a view echoed by the Guardian's Lucy Mangan, who said it was \"the closest thing to TV perfection in decades\".\nFans on social media ranged from US director Paul Feig, who called the first episode \"one of the best hours of television I've ever seen\", to Jeremy Clarkson, who called it \"masterful\".\nAdolescence shows the aftermath of the stabbing of a teenage girl, with a 13-year-old boy from her school arrested for her murder.\nJamie, the young suspect, is played by newcomer Owen Cooper, with Stephen Graham as his dad.\nIts story shines a light on the corrosive impact of social media and misogynist influencers on some teenage boys.\nGraham said he was inspired to make the show after seeing two separate reports of boys stabbing girls to death.\n\"I just thought, what's going on in society where this kind of thing is becoming a regular occurrence?\" he told BBC's The One Show.\n\"I just couldn't fathom it. So I wanted to really have a look and try and shine a light on this particular thing.\"\nWriter Jack Thorne said they wanted to \"look in the eye of male rage\".\nThe central character had been \"indoctrinated by voices\" like Andrew Tate's and \"voices a lot more dangerous than Andrew Tate's\", Thorne told Radio 4's Front Row.\nErin Doherty, who plays a child psychologist, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This show has the bravery to just peel back the layers and go, let's talk about this thing, because we're still dealing with it today. There are still issues cropping up in the news today.\n\"So all we can hold ourselves accountable for is having the discussion, and hopefully that's what it does. It just allows parents, aunties, uncles, even just friends, to engage in the conversation.\"\nEach episode was filmed in a single, uninterrupted take.\nIn the Guardian, Mangan said its technical accomplishments \"are matched by an array of award-worthy performances and a script that manages to be intensely naturalistic and hugely evocative at the same time\".\nShe added: \"Adolescence is a deeply moving, deeply harrowing experience.\"\nPeck's review in the Times began: \"Wow. Just wow. I'm tempted to type out the word 'wow' a further 700 times or so, followed by, 'Don't miss Adolescence on Netflix,' and then be done with it.\"\nThe Telegraph's TV critic Anita Singh said it was \"a devastating watch\", adding: \"It is a drama so quietly devastating that I won't forget it for a very long time.\" \nSingh said the single-shot technique \"can feel like a gimmick\" but that the acting is \"phenomenal\".\nGraham is \"the best actor working today\", but \"the truly remarkable performance\" is by Cooper, she wrote.\n\"He moves between vulnerability, anger, bravado and fear. What he does here is astonishing.\"\n\nElsewhere, Deadline's Jake Kanter wrote: \"Adolescence is as flawless a four hours of TV drama I have ever seen. It lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled. Astonishing telly.\"\nRolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall said it was \"among the very best things - and an early contender for the best thing - you will see on the small screen this year\".\nThe New York Times' Margaret Lyons called it \"a rich work of social critique\", describing the standout episode, the third, as \"one of the more fascinating hours of TV I've seen in a long time\".\nOn BBC Radio 5 Live's Must Watch, Hayley Campbell said the drama doesn't attempt to solve the problems it raises.\n\"It's bringing it up, it's looking at it. It's about the rise of misogyny, especially in young boys, brought about by people like Andrew Tate, who's namechecked in this, but only once. It's not about him.\n\"The drama is more about the horror of how little control you have over your kid and what they're doing on their phone.\"\nFellow critic Scott Bryan added: \"The performances are absolutely fantastic. I would say this is flawless. The person, though, I think who deserves the most recognition is 15-year-old Owen Cooper.\"",

        "article_text": "The iconic 90s hip-hop artist was known for his pained intensity. But Dear Mama, a tribute to his mother Afeni, showed off his softer side \u2013 and still brings listeners to tears.\n\"Not everyone is so lucky and gets to experience the love of a mother for a long time,\" explains DJ Master Tee, whose words are staggered due to deep emotion, before he starts to cry down the phone.\u00a0\n\"A lot of people's mothers died way too early\u2026 and I think Tupac Shakur understood that well,\" the producer continues. \"He didn't just want to make a song that celebrated the mothers who are here, but also the ones that passed away.\"\nDJ Master Tee made the original silky-smooth beat (which was later adapted by co-producer Tony Pizarro) for Dear Mama, the late rap legend Tupac's candid tribute to the many sacrifices of his single mother Afeni Shakur. She was an activist in the radical political group The Black Panthers, who subsequently struggled with drug addiction and to make ends meet while raising her two children.\nThis song is the pained yet ultimately joyful epicentre of Tupac's otherwise death-obsessed third studio album, Me Against the World, which was released 30 years ago this month. In the context of an album where Tupac shifts from suicidal (So Many Tears) to grief-stricken (Lord Knows), repeatedly using the word \"hopeless\", Dear Mama feels like uncovering a diamond at the bottom of a pitch-black mine.\n\"Even as a crack phene, momma / You always were a black queen, momma,\" he famously rapped.\nThis lyric alone represented a radical shift in rap storytelling in the way it represented victims of the so-called Crack Era, when use of the drug soared across the US during the 1980s and 90s.\nPreviously, rap artists had stripped away the humanity of crack addicts via slurs such as \"basehead\" and \"zombie\". But, Tee says, Tupac saw addicts \"as victims of the state, who needed our support\". And although Tupac expresses sadness over a childhood with little money \u2013 where he and his sister Sekyiwa observed the matriarch of their family descend into the hell of addiction \u2013 he leads with empathy for Afeni Shakur's struggle.\nHe chants out all his words with a bear-hug warmth, confirming that he never stopped seeing Afeni as a superhero. In celebrating her, Tupac serves to pay respect to the struggle of single mothers everywhere, as well as mothers full stop \u2013 a sentiment the whole world can appreciate. This is reflected in the numbers, with the song racking up over 345 million streams on Spotify alone. Indeed, Dear Mama remains one of the rapper's most celebrated tracks: in 2009, it became the first song by a solo rapper to be inducted into the US Library of Congress's National Recording Registry, awarded for its profound cultural significance.\n\"It really doesn't matter if you grew up in the ghetto or not, because Dear Mama transcends all of that,\" explains the song's engineer, Paul Arnold. \"You could be rich, poor, black, white, brown, whatever; you'll find a way to relate to the song.\u00a0Honestly, it's difficult for me to even talk about it and not get choked up. It forces you to think about your own mother and that isn't always easy. Behind all the controversy, it was obvious he was a very emotional guy.\"\u00a0\nTo properly explore the creation of this song, you must follow the roots of the woman who inspired it. Born in North Carolina in 1947, Afeni Shakur (whose birth name was Alice Faye Williams) was confronted with racism from the start. This was a time where Jim Crow laws around racial segregation were bluntly enforced.\nAfeni's family moved to the Bronx when she was 11. Despite living in the diverse melting pot of New York City, she felt she was part of a system designed to push black people to the bottom of US society. She found solace hanging around local street gangs (including the Gangster Disciples) and subscribed to the \"by any means necessary\" approach of activist Malcolm X, who preached that black Americans should violently resist their oppressors in sharp contrast to Martin Luther King's celebrated pacifism. After seeing the co-founder of the Black Panther party Bobby Seale speak at a political rally in 1968, Afeni was inspired enough to join, telling The New York Times in 1970 she was impressed by the way he spoke of the homeless leading their revolution: \"I'd never seen that before.\"\nAfeni quickly rose through the ranks of the Black Panthers, pioneering a free breakfast plan for hungry schoolchildren and starting a protest campaign against exploitative landlords. The party won high-profile enemies including FBI director J Edgar Hoover, who ran surveillance on key members (resulting in the 1969 assassination of radical deputy chairman Fred Hampton) and considered the group a threat to the status-quo. In 1971, Afeni was one of 21 Black Panther members indicted by a New York grand jury, accused of plotting to shoot police officers.\nFrom prison Afeni maintained a position of strength, writing in one unapologetic letter to the media: \"We know that we live in a world inhuman in its poverty. We know that we are a colony, living under community imperialism. The US that we see is not one of freedom, beauty, and wisdom, but of fear, terror, and hate. We have no respect for your laws, taxes, your gratitude, sincerity, honour and dignity. You don't respect us \u2013 thus we don't respect YOU.\" This defiance and righteous anger would be something her future son would directly channel into his rap career.\u00a0\nHeavily pregnant and facing a 300-year prison sentence, Afeni refused legal counsel, choosing to represent herself in what was then the most expensive trial in the history of New York State. Despite the bleak odds, she won her freedom and was the driving force behind the Panthers being acquitted on all 156 counts. Born a month after the trial ended, her son Tupac Amaru was named after the Peruvian warrior who led the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Spanish American History. Right from his birth on 16 June 1971, Afeni's boy had revolution and black nationalism pulsing through his veins.\nGrowing up in East Harlem, Tupac was often surrounded by enemies of the state. His stepfather Mutulu Shakur and step-aunt Assata Shakur were political rebels on the FBI's Most Wanted List. A paranoid Afeni also taught her son how to spot undercover federal agents lurking outside their apartment building by observing their shaky body language and suspect sunglasses. If Tupac ever misbehaved, he would be punished by being forced to read The New York Times cover-to-cover.\u00a0\nHis knowledge of global politics was at an advanced level long before his 10th birthday, and while the other kids read comic books, Tupac was learning how fear is more powerful than respect through reading Machiavelli's The Prince. He also admired how his mother, to quote lyrics from Dear Mama, \"made miracles every Thanksgiving\" \u2013 cooking a wholesome meal despite working multiple jobs and living off welfare food stamps.\nAfeni had on-off partners who served as role models to Tupac, but he never really had a stable father figure in his life, with biological dad (and fellow Black Panther) Billy Garland largely absent until later years. When the Black Panthers disbanded, Afeni, like so many of her peers, struggled to readjust to mainstream society. Years of being accosted by police led to her suffering PTSD, and during a choppy childhood living in New York, Baltimore, and Marin City, California, Tupac watched his mother's sharp decline. She increasingly self-medicated with drugs to alleviate her pain.\nA talented actor who could quote Shakespeare at will, Tupac secured a place at the coveted Baltimore School of the Arts. It helped push him away from trouble and family drama. But when the family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area due to financial problems, Tupac's academic hopes dissolved into the ether.\u00a0Converting the poetry he wrote to process childhood trauma into chart-topping raps became Tupac's main focus; he saw himself as that rare rose which could grow through the harshness of the inner-city concrete.\nFormer DJ Billy Dee first met Tupac early on in his rap career, back when he was a member of the funk hip-hop collective the Digital Underground. They bonded during a 1989 tour that brought the group over to Berlin, where Dee's family was also based.\u00a0\"He hated the German food and the big sausages,\" she recalls. \"I invited him back to my mom's house and she cooked him fried chicken. My mom was a single mother and I remember he liked that about her a lot.\"\nShe continues: \"If you were with him, he would literally die to protect you. But he was so radically smart, too. My mom had photos with Yasser Arafat on the wall. Tupac, even as a young man, knew exactly who that was and spoke passionately during our lunch about supporting the historical struggle of the Palestinian state.\"\nA student of political emcees like Chuck D and Ice Cube, Tupac had similarly socially conscious lyrics, which passionately furthered Bobby Seale's dream of a black community where should someone fall down, everyone else served as their crutches. He quickly was signed to Interscope Records and, on Tupac's stirring 1991 debut album 2Pacalypse Now, the gut punch of a rap fable Brenda's Got a Baby told the story of a teenage black girl who faces horrific neglect and abuse. It's Dickensian in its three-dimensional dissection of society's most forgotten casualties.\u00a0\nYet the rising artist was also a magnet for controversy, and many couldn't get past the palpable contradictions in his music. For every bluesy song that advocated women having full autonomy over their bodies (Keep Ya Head Up) or preached unity within gang neighbourhoods, there were more nihilistic street anthems where Tupac referred to women using offensive slurs and glorified shooting crooked cops. It was unclear whether he wanted to lead the revolution or simply press the self-destruct button.\u00a0\nFrom firing at two off-duty police officers harassing a black motorist (the charges were later dropped) in Atlanta, to being convicted for assaulting film director Allen Hughes, a fatalistic Tupac was often in the newspapers more for controversy than actual music. Going into the creation of his third solo album, Me Against the World, the artist desperately needed a song that showed a softer side.\u00a0\nDJ Master Tee remembers the night he gave Tupac the beat to Dear Mama well. After Tupac had just come off stage doing a landmark freestyle at New York's Madison Square Garden alongside then-friend and fellow rapper The Notorious B.I.G. Backstage, Tee gave the rapper a cassette filled with beats. It didn't take long until Tupac called him up, excited about one particular instrumental that was built around an interpretation of jazz keyboardist Joe Sample's soothing In All My Wildest Dreams.\nMaster Tee had flipped this song's lovelorn, slowly caressed keys by matching them with raw vinyl scratches. Tee knew his use of this sample would trigger something deep within Tupac and he likens its tone to a sunny afternoon spent reminiscing over family photos. On the original version, which was recorded in October 1993, Tupac opens by saying: \"Yo, Master Tee, drop something for my momma!\" Tee says the words flowed out of Tupac with \"real ease\" in the studio.\nIn a 1995 interview with the LA Times, Tupac said he had wanted to make the rap equivalent of Don McLean's Vincent. \"So it came out like this deep love ballad,\" Tee says. \"He was a machine with it! He would do a full song with three or four verses as well as a bridge and hook in one take, and it would sound perfect. I also worked with Prince and Tupac reminded me of him. They were both workaholics, who you never saw yawn once. There was a mission behind the music!\"\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Kendrick Lamar's road to the Superbowl\n\u2022\u00a0The provocative 80s rap that became an anthem\n\u2022\u00a0The party that started hip-hop\nIn 2023, Master Tee, aka Terrence Thomas, filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against parties including Tupac's record label Interscope and its parent company\u00a0Universal Music Group claiming he was \"never properly and fully credited with his publishing copyright from the writing and creation of the music of Dear Mama\". Last year, it was reported, Universal Music began the process of seeking the claim's dismissal.\nEngineer Paul Arnold, alongside the producer Tony Pizarro, was later asked by the label to make the song more timeless and radio-friendly. Although they kept the beat's foundational sample, they added\u00a0more instrumental layers as well as a syrupy R&B hook that interpreted the song Sadie by Motown group The Spinners. \"They didn't like what we turned in at first,\" recalls Arnold. \"But we persuaded them to live with it overnight. The next day we got a call like: 'Don't touch it!'\"\nArnold met Tupac a few times in New York's Quad Studios and was impressed by the way he took time to speak to everybody and hear out their life story. \"He'd be interested enough to listen to the life story of the guy bringing in the coffee,\" Arnold says.\nTupac tended to stack his vocals, recording three or four separate versions of the same verse, combining the various voices so his presence was more commanding and carried an eerie pull. It resulted in a voice that was gigantic and filled with duelling layers of pain; the raps were bellowed out like an ancient mountain-top God shouting down prophecies to his followers. However, Dear Mama was the rare track where Tupac had insisted on only one vocal track.\u00a0\n\"One of the reasons his voice sounds softer than usual on Dear Mama is because we pulled back on the vocal layering,\" Arnold explains. \"We wanted Tupac's voice to have more of a direct feel, so it's like a one-on-one conversation.\"\u00a0\nTupac, who raps: \"I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man,\" recognised that it was single mothers who shouldered the extra burdens working class boys racked up during their transition into men. He also pleaded for troubled young black males to forgive their mothers for any hardships, finding a way to exchange grudges for love and deep-rooted appreciation.\u00a0\n\"Dear Mama proved that even the biggest gangsta rapper in America with Thug Life tattooed on his chest could still be super vulnerable,\" says Arnold, who believes the fact Tupac's vocals sound on the edge of tears remains the song's biggest strength. \"He really was more like a preacher than a rapper. He knew crying made you more of a man. I got to meet Afeni, when I worked on posthumous Tupac music later on. When we met, she gave me the biggest hug. All the love that's inside Dear Mama made more sense to me after that.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nThe purgative Dear Mama was a big hit, reaching the peak of the Billboard Rap Songs chart, just as the album went to number one too; it was accompanied by a music video, featuring Afeni beaming with pride while looking through old photos of her son. It's still part of the cultural conversation years later: in 2023, FX released a TV docu-series bearing the song's name and focusing on Afeni and Tupac's rollercoaster relationship. At the time of Dear Mama's release in 1995, Tupac was imprisoned on sexual assault charges, which he always vigorously denied, and still nursing five bullet wounds sustained in an ambush while visiting the same studio where he'd laid down Dear Mama vocals. The world didn't know whether to see him as a pariah or an outlaw.\u00a0\u00a0\nA lot has been made of the period that followed its release: Tupac was eventually bailed out of prison by the notorious Death Row Records's CEO Suge Knight pending an appeal of his conviction, and his music took a more war-ready stance, culminating in his murder in a drive-by shooting on 7 September 1996 in Las Vegas. Yet for DJ Master Tee, it's Dear Mama that best represents Tupac's humanity. \"It's a really simple song and it's very catchy, but this allowed it to resonate with more people,\" he says. \"It's a song that will outlive us all. Whenever the grieving press play on Dear Mama, they'll instantly be able to recall what a mother's embrace feels like.\"\nThis tribute to the dead was confirmed by a live performance of Dear Mama at a 1996 Mother's Day charity benefit organised by Death Row Records for single mothers. The rapper explained to the cheering crowd: \"[With this song] I want to talk about the people who don't got mommas anymore. We sometimes forget to appreciate our mothers! But my little homie Mutah [Beale, who was a member of Tupac's Outlaw Immortalz collective and, as a toddler, watched his parents get murdered in the family living room] hasn't got no mother today. He can't share in our smiles.\"\nIt all goes back to something Tupac says on the song's third verse: \"And there's no way I can pay you back / But my plan is to show you that I understand.\" This proves Dear Mama isn't just a song, but more a ritual; a sonic safe space for the listener to sit still and reminisce on their mother's sacrifices. As Arnold concludes: \"Tupac immortalises a mother's love and their willingness to do whatever it takes to ensure their child is doing alright. That will always be powerful, no matter who you are.\"\nThe FX docuseries Dear Mama is available to watch on Disney+\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",
