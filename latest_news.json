It's actually a French production, largely set in Mexico, with Spanish as the main language spoken. \nKarla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's nomination made her the first trans person to be nominated in an acting category (although Elliot Page was nominated for Juno in 2008, before the actor transitioned).\nHowever, the film \u2013 which had already caused controversy in Mexico \u2013 has been beset by controversy following a social media row involving Gasc\u00f3n.\nEmilia P\u00e9rez remains strong in a couple of categories, but it's unlikely to sweep the board in the way Oppenheimer \u2013 which also had 13 nominations \u2013 did last year.\nChasing down Emilia P\u00e9rez with 10 nods is three-and-a-half epic The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody.\nWicked also has 10 nominations, including for British actress Cynthia Erivo and her co-star Ariana Grande, while Demi Moore has the first Oscar nomination of her career for her role in The Substance.\nMeanwhile, pope selection drama Conclave has eight nominations, including best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes.\nAll the films above are up for the coveted best picture prize, and are joined by Anora, about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nThe film, which has six nominations, leapt ahead in the race after a string of precursor wins at the Critics Choice Awards as well as two major guild ceremonies - the Directors Guild of America and Producers Guild of America Awards.\nBut there remains no consensus on what will ultimately win the top prize \u2013 with the other contenders for best picture including A Complete Unknown, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here and Nickel Boys.\nThis has been an unpredictable awards season, and there could still be plenty of surprises in store.\nIn the best actress category, Moore, 62, is nominated for playing a fading star who swaps her body for a younger and more beautiful version of herself in The Substance.\nBut it's a tight race.\nThere were gasps backstage at the Baftas (where I was) when Anora star Mikey Madison scooped up the best actress prize.\nIt was a big blow to the assumed Oscar momentum for Moore, and an incredible moment for Madison, who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nBest actor may also be up in the air. Adrien Brody is the frontrunner, with his nod for The Brutalist \u2013 but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is his toughest competition, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.\nLast week, Chalamet's surprise SAG win shook up the race, after his somewhat eccentric awards campaign.\nIf he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner of best actor.\nIn the best supporting actor category, Kieran Culkin is the frontrunner for A Real Pain, while Zoe Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.\nIt's worth noting it's been a decade since the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite started trending, due to the lack of diversity at the 2015 Academy Awards.\nThis year, there are people of colour in both the best actress and best actor categories.\nIn fact, Sing Sing's Colman Domingo is nominated for best leading actor for the second year in a row.\nElsewhere, however, progress remains slow.\nCoralie Fargeat is the only woman to be nominated for best director, for The Substance, out of a field of five.\n\"Has there been progress, yes. Has there been enough? Absolutely not,\" April Reign, LA-based founder of the #OscarsSoWhite movement, told me.\n\"It was never just about the Oscars not being black enough. It was also about gender, age, class, sexuality and geography too.\"\n\"If we're still able to count them on one hand, then we're not there yet.\"\nMost of the nominees will be gracing the red carpet \u2013 I'm already betting we'll see more tears and hand holding from Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\nThere had been a big question mark over whether Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n will show up after the row over her past tweets.\nHowever, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself \u2013 although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.\nPresenters include Halle Berry, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Emma Stone.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles.\nThe nominations themselves were postponed twice due to the fires.\nThere's no doubt it's going to be hard for the awards to strike the right tone when so many people are suffering. It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.\nCancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.\nShe told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.\n\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.\nThis year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.\nInstead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.\nI can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nDoja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.\nThe Academy Awards ceremony is hosted this year for the first time by comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien.\nHe replaces US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel, who has presented the show four times including last year.\nThe 2025 Oscars will air live on Sunday 2 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002.\nThe show can be watched in the US on ABC and can be streamed on Hulu. It is also being broadcast around the world in more than 200 territories.\nUK viewers can watch on ITV and ITVX from 22:30 GMT.\nCynthia Erivo is the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting, after also being nominated for Harriet in 2020.\nIf she wins best actress this time, for playing Elphaba in Wicked, she'll become an EGOT - having completed the set of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards.\nRalph Fiennes is flying the flag in the best actor category with his first nomination for 28 years. He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.\nElsewhere, Felicity Jones is nominated for best supporting actress for The Brutalist - a decade after her first Oscar nomination - while Sir Elton John is in the best original song race.\nThe country will also be rooting for two more screen legends - Wallace and Gromit (and their makers Aardman Animations), who are hoping for their fourth Oscar. They are shortlisted for best animated feature for their latest outing, Vengeance Most Fowl.\nRead more about this year's awards season films:",

        "article_text": "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.\nThe decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.\nHunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.\nBut some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.\n\nIt's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.\nConservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream. \n\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon. \n\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.\nThe beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England. \nIt says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure. \nThat's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.\nNFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\". \n\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"\nWe met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".\nSince then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.\n\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.\n\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"\nAlong the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.\nNot everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.\nClinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.\n\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.\n\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"\nScotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.\nThe first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days.

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation \u2013 with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Gene Hackman was a normal person in Santa Fe. And he really loved that.\nResidents in the New Mexico city say they were excited to welcome such a massive celebrity to the community when he and his wife Betsy Arakawa arrived more than 20 years ago, but they treated him like anyone else.\n\"He wasn't famous here\" was the phrase I heard when asking residents about why the movie star chose to call New Mexico's capital home. They describe a down-to-earth, chatty man who supported local businesses and enjoyed its flourishing arts scene.\nEveryone here has a story to tell about Hackman, who was found dead alongside his wife and their dog at their home in the quiet desert city earlier this week. \nHackman was a lover of the arts and a painter himself, so he fit in well: Santa Fe is known for its iconic adobe architecture and is home to more than 250 galleries.\nEverything in Santa Fe is colourful, from the woven tapestry hanging on shop walls to the clothes people wear and even their personalities.\nThere are murals in almost every alley and metal street art lining the roads. \nHackman immediately got involved with local art museums, most notably sitting on the board of directors at the Georgia O'Keeffe museum, while Arakawa had a luxury home-goods store, and collaborated with artists on various projects.\nHackman's paintings are displayed prominently at local restaurants, and there are a few lucky residents who have them hanging in their home.\nOne of those people is Stuart Ashman, the executive director of the Artes de Cuba gallery.\nMr Ashman first met Hackman at a community arts meeting. He was running late and there was one seat left when he arrived: next to the Hollywood star.\nThey shook hands and that started two decades of friendship.\n\"He was so down to earth that you didn't realize that you were talking to a celebrity. He was more interested in you than in telling you about himself,\" Mr Ashman said.\nWhile both men supported the arts community, their real bond came through Pilates workouts when they took back-to-back private lessons.\nWhen asked who was better, Mr Ashman laughed. \"I think we're both pretty bad,\" he said. \"Our teacher said I was lazy and he was older and stiffer.\"\nMr Ashman said Hackman often got in trouble for being too much of a chatterbox.\n\"Gene, are you going to workout or do you just want to talk to Stuart today?\" Mr Ashman recalls their Pilates teacher asking.\nEvery week, Mr Ashman, who raised chickens, would bring a dozen eggs to Hackman. \nThen one day, he showed up with a huge landscape painting as repayment to Mr Ashman, who didn't want to accept it. But Hackman insisted and said a painting for eggs is \"a very fair deal\". \nWhen Hackman wasn't at Pilates or riding his bike through the beautiful landscape, he loved to spend time at his home  in the hills above the city, his friends said.\nPerched on a 12-acre plot, the property has panoramic views of the surrounding mountains, with vistas stretching as far as Colorado.\nHackman purchased the home in the 1980s before starting expansive renovations. He wanted this home to have meaning, so he worked with an architect to blend  Pueblo, Colonial, and Spanish Baroque architectural styles to pay homage to Santa Fe's rich cultural history.\nArakawa also enjoyed her secluded life in Santa Fe. People I spoke to said she was a talented pianist and smart business woman. \nThe only person who liked working out more than Hackman was Betsy. They said she was in incredible shape, always attending exercise classes.  \nThough Hackman was an active member of the community for most of his post-Hollywood years, he became much more isolated after Covid-19 lockdowns, locals said.\nThose who knew him speculate his health and age made mobility too difficult to wander down the hill into town.\nBut everyone still had a story about Hackman.\nJames Roybal, a native of Santa Fe, once signed up for a pastel painting class in the 1980s and when he arrived Hackman was also there.\nThey painted next to each other for a bit, making small talk.\nMr Roybal couldn't believe the celebrity would want to be there. He took a picture from a ways back because he didn't think anyone would believe him. He still boasts about the image.\nVictoria Murphy, a real estate agent and actress, saw him around town on several occasions.\n\"I was in the middle of the street as I was crossing in the crosswalk, and he started to go through the stop sign at that time, and then suddenly saw me stopped, waved, smiled, held up both hands, you know, like in a surrender,\" she recalled.  \"And I just smiled and kept going.\"\nAt a local restaurant in town, customers told me they'd see him at the grocery store, or shopping on the high street. \nDavid, the general manager of a shop in downtown Santa Fe where Hackman was a long-time patron, was holding back tears, remembering his friend and client.\n\"Since he lived here, he wanted to use his money towards the local people. He always bought Seiko watches from my store for his friends and family. \n\"He invested in local restaurants and grocery stores, and showed up to openings for art museums. It obviously wasn't because he needed the money, but because he loved the local flare,\" he said.\n\"We lost a great Santa Fein.\"",

Five years after it looked as though Danny Welbeck's career was petering out, the 34-year-old sent Albion into the FA Cup quarter-finals.When Welbeck played 18 times and scored twice in Watford's Premier League relegation campaign in 2019-20, it didn't seem like there were great days ahead of him.The former (more on this later) England frontman left the Hornets on a free transfer and joined Brighton after the transfer window had closed in October 2020.An un-Brighton-like signing, a 29-year-old injury-prone forward - surely just a stop-gap?And yet, the two-time FA Cup winner with Arsenal has had a storming time in Sussex - capped off by his latest goal.In extra time of their FA Cup fifth-round tie with Newcastle, he ran on to Solly March's pass before clipping a clever finish over Martin Dubravka from a tight angle to make it 2-1.That is his eighth goal of the season - only behind two of his Manchester United seasons and one at Arsenal. \"It's great to get the winning goal,\" he said after the cup win at Newcastle, where he came on as an 80th-minute substitute.

It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.\nIt was never supposed to be for daily use.\nIn fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years. \nNow, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.\nIn the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.\nHowever, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.\nThe back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.\nJust because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.\nThere is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution. \nClimate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.\nAnd in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.\nGatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.\nThen there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.\nEven if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.\n\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC. \n\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.\nGatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.\nBut there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.\nBy 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.\nIt will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.\nPoliticians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.\nWhile there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.\nRichard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.\nIn the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.\nBut this government has staked its reputation on overcoming opposition to projects that it believes will boost growth, indicating it wants to see airport expansion despite the objections.

        "article_text": "The Brit Awards belonged to Charli XCX on Saturday night, who completed her transformation from underground hero to bona fide pop star by winning five awards including best artist and song of the year.\nEzra Collective, Sam Fender, Stormzy and The Last Dinner Party were the other big British winners on Saturday night, while Fontaines DC and Chappell Roan bagged the international awards. \nThe night also included a memorable, blush-inducing performance from US pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter, who was handed the global success award at London's O2 Arena.\nThe arena fell silent near the end of the show for a moving video tribute to the late Liam Payne, who died last October.\nDespite not performing, Charli XCX stole the show by winning the biggest awards of the night - artist of the year, album of the year for her cultural phenomenon Brat, and song of the year for Guess.\n\"This is cool, I'm really happy that a song about underwear now has a Brit award, very important stuff\", said Charli, dryly, on stage after collecting her first award.\n \"I'm sure that that proves something about songwriting but I'm not sure what.\"\nShe went on to thank Eilish - the first non-Brit to appear on a best song-winner - for her guest vocals on Guess which she delivered at just three days notice. \"Thank you Billie for running and gunning...\"\nThe 32-year-old from Essex also picked up the best dance act and songwriter of the year awards.\nIn her speech for best dance act, she spoke of the importance of the night-time genre. \"I feel like dance music, electronic music gets a really bad rep' because everyone is like, 'it's not that deep, is it?'. And I kind of feel it is,\" she said.\n\"This genre of music for me is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nAs she collected her fifth and final award of the night for best album, Charli told the crowd how she had \"always felt like an outsider\" up until this point.\n\"Culture caught up with us and wanted to be on the journey with us - I am living proof that it takes a long time but you don't need to compromise your vision,\" she added.\nIt's always difficult getting the tone of the opening performance right - but Carpenter certainly nailed the brief with her mash-up of mega-hit Espresso and recent favourite from her best-selling album, Bed Chem.\nFans of the star who have been eagerly following her Short n' Sweet Tour will have recognised some elements of it in her Brits performance - which was given a suitably British update with the opening strains of Rule Britannia and a, ahem, close encounter with a beefeater.\nCarpenter also became the first international star to accept the global success award, jokingly saying it was \"an insane honour, for such a tea-drinking country you streamed the [heck] out of espresso.\"\nWearing some lingerie that might have been a little bit too racy for the pre-watershed slot, her performance around a heart-shaped bed was energetic and embodied her cheeky style that has elevated her fame in recent months.\nBest pop act winner, Jade - of little mix Fame - attempted to top this with a performance of her song Angel Of My Dreams.\nIn it she appeared in a blonde wig and big white fur coat before disappearing briefly somewhere in a crowd of dancers and re-emerging as an angel suspended above the stage. \nSeveral artists used their winning platform to urge the powers-that-be to do more to protect artists and give them the time, space and funds to develop.\nJazz group Ezra Collective - who closed the night with an upbeat performance alongside Jorja Smith - won group of the year, with Femi Koleoso expressing that giving a young person at a youth club a trumpet, for example, could help to fix \"so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK\".\nChappell Roan, who won best international act and international song for Good Luck, Babe!, noted via a video link how she had to write \"a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones\".\nRising star winner Myles Smith - or \"The Luton Bob Dylan\", as host Jack Whitehall called him - performed his hit Stargazing and called on the government to stop treating British music as an \"after thought\" while urging the music industry itself to stick with artists past their first viral hits and tours.\nIt was also a night that marked the return of Sam Fender, with the Geordie singer-songwriter picking up the best alternative/rock act.\nHe thanked his band in his speech, saying he would just be a \"mad man shouting at walls\" without them.\nIt marks the end of a huge week for Fender, who also topped the UK album charts with People Watching - which had the biggest opening week for a British album since Harry Styles' Harry's House in 2022.\nHe topped off the evening with an emphatic performance of its title track.\nBest hip-hop winner Stormzy thanked Jesus and read a verse from the bible before explaining that he was wearing shades as he had \"mashed my eye up playing padel\".\nBest R&B act winner Raye said via video that she was \"still recovering\" from last year's event when she won a record-breaking six awards.\nDublin rock band Fontaines D.C said they were \"buzzing\" to win best international group and did so, fittingly, from Down Under.\nAnd Teddy Swims performed his hit Lose Control on a flame-filled stage - a potential fire hazard in his baggy oversized jacket - before Lola Young played her viral hit in a Messy makeshift room.\nIt's four years since Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards - with Mo Gilligan filling the gap - and he noted how broadcasters ITV \"had to come crawling back to an ex\" in asking him back.\nHe poked fun at the stars in the audience, underlining how Charli, in true British style, \"had asked not to perform on the show so she can get drunk\".\nAnd referencing Stormzy's recent high profile adverts, he called the star \"the grime scene's Ronald McDonald - he's loving it\".\nAiming a light dig at YouTuber KSI, the host joked: \"You are as good a rapper as Aitch... from Steps\".\nHaving flown over from US filming commitments a few days ago, he showed little signs of jet lag in his bid to \"Make the Brits Great Again\", as he had joked in a pre-show video this week.\n\"If you thought Trump-Zelensky was cringe then wait until you hear me...\" he quipped.\nIt reached peak cringe though when his parents appeared alongside him in one segment, with his dad dressed as Kanye West.\nThe biggest cheer of the night came when actor Danny Dyer told Whitehall that \"the world is being run by cranks\".\nLiam Payne, who tragically died in Argentina aged 31, had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist.\nThe ceremony included a touching tribute to the star, which was a bit of a gear shift towards the end of the fun-packed show, as Whitehall queued up a sombre black and white montage of Payne's career, including music and quotes from him and his bandmates.\n\"I hope that me singing today brings enjoyment to someone,\" he was heard saying.\nSeven-time Brit winner Dua Lipa won nothing on the night despite having received four nominations.\nThere were also snubs for royal royalty The Beatles, Coldplay and The Cure, who like Dua, all lost out to Charli in various catergories.\nLet's hope they're not too Bratty about it.",

        "article_text": "The legendary actor tells Katty Kay that his parents would have much rather he became an accountant or insurance broker, but finally came around when they saw him perform on stage.\nWith a shelf filled with awards, including Screen Actors Guild trophies, Emmys, a Golden Globe, a Tony and a pair of Olivier Awards, 86-year-old Sir Derek Jacobi has proven to be much more than \"the classical Shakespearean actor of our generation,\" as BBC special correspondent Katty Kay describes him during an interview at his home in London.\nSir Derek credits a serendipitous combination of luck and talent for his decades-long career, which includes roles in blockbusters like Gladiator and its 2024 sequel, and stints on sitcom Frasier, for which he won the 2001 Emmy for outstanding guest actor in a comedy series.\n\"Somehow, I was born to be an actor. That's what I feel. There was never any alternative,\" Sir Derek says about first appearing on the stage at the age of 17. He was born in north-east London to a father who ran a sweet shop and a mother who was a secretary. \"That's what I wanted. That's what I thought I could do. That's what I enjoyed.\"\nEnjoying the spotlight was just a part of his success. Sir Derek notes that after he found himself at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre (which he affectionately calls the Rep) in 1960, there wasn't anything else that matched the euphoria of basking in an audience's applause. It was a far cry from what his parents had hoped for. Like most, they'd expected their son to go into a field with stability, like accounting or insurance.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"I always thought\u2026 I wanted to be an actor. I had no talent for anything else,\" he says. \"Hamlet confirmed it.\" After reciting one of the doomed prince's monologues to Kay, Sir Derek admits that most of his roles have disappeared into the ether, but the work of the Bard has stayed with him since those early performances almost 70 years ago. \"All the other parts have gone. Hamlet's still around. Shakespeare stays.\"\nSir Derek is quick to name drop some of his esteemed colleagues: Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Albert Finney and Sir Robert Stephens. But he's as quick to note that he didn't have the classical training many of them had. He tells Kay that it was a bit of luck that led to his successes, which include being knighted by the late Queen Elizabeth II and earning the Danish Order of the Dannebrog.\n\"I think there's talent and I think there's luck. Without that luck, the talent isn't enough on its own,\" he says. \"You've got to have the opportunity to show you've got talent. Without that opportunity\u2026 nobody's seeing it.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\u00a0\n\u2022 Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn explains the mindset of a winner\u00a0\nAnother obstacle Jacobi notes was the fact that he was never seen as classically handsome. \"They had a head start because they were nice to look at,\" he says of Stephens and Olivier, while he credits being able to hone his craft in front of an audience from the age of 17 as what set him apart. He tells Kay that luck landed him that first job and his time at the Rep stood in for drama school. \"It was a huge learning experience.\"\nAnd although Sir Derek says he hasn't stopped learning, he works at a different pace now, and has learned to find new ways of working.\n\"You slow down,\" the 86-year-old says. \"It's more difficult to remember lines. I used to have a very sharp brain. I don't anymore. That, obviously, is age.\" These days, he has some help with those lines via an earpiece just in case, with Kay likening it to a skier using a knee brace.\u00a0\n\"I've really had a charmed life,\" Sir Derek says, reflecting on his career, his long-time husband, theatre director Richard Clifford, and the fact that he can still do what he loves. Sir Derek's upcoming projects include appearances in episodes of Doctor Who Unbound and Good Omens as well as films The Vampyre: Blood & Ink, with Malcolm McDowell and action-comedy Tinsel Town, alongside Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland.\n\"I can't complain about anything in my life.\"\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "This story contains distressing details from the start \nWhen Mauricette Vinet speaks of her grandson, her voice grows warm with affection.\n\"He was a lovely little boy. He had a strong personality, for sure! But he always thought of others, always asked if he could help,\" says the French retiree, in her 80s.\n\"He loved to be out in the garden with his grandfather, picking green beans. He was a charming boy, Mathis,\" she adds.\n\"But, as you know, there was a 'before' - and there was an 'after'.\"\nMauricette and her husband Roland are among the 267 plaintiffs who have pressed charges against Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, the French former surgeon who is accused of abusing almost 300 people - mostly children, and almost all his patients - over the course of several decades. The trial started in Vannes, Brittany, on Monday. \nLe Scouarnec and Mathis only crossed paths once, when Mathis, aged 10, was hospitalised overnight at the clinic in the small French north-western town of Quimperl\u00e9. Le Scouarnec - a mild-mannered, respected gastroenterologist - told Mathis' parents the boy had to be kept overnight for checks.\nIt turned out Mathis only had a stomach ache, and he was sent home the next day. But Mauricette is convinced the brief hospital stay changed Mathis forever.\n\"The unease set in, little by little. It happened gradually in the first year; then he stopped being happy and became aggressive with everyone,\" she tells the BBC.\nThere is no way to establish conclusively whether Mathis' troubles were linked to the surgeon. What is certain is that in his teenage years Mathis distanced himself from his family and started using increasingly hard drugs; later, he spent time in detox and rehab centres.\nThen, in 2018, police knocked on his door. \nThey told him a man named Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec had been arrested the year before for raping his six-year-old neighbour. During a search of the surgeon's home, police uncovered stacks of diaries and hard disks in which Le Scouarnec appeared to list hundreds more victims. Mathis' name was among them.\nMauricette said Mathis told her police then read out an excerpt of the diary to him, which seemed to detail abuse Le Scouarnec's inflicted on him during his hospital stay.\n\"Then they left. Mathis shut the door and was left on his own, with no help. And that was the beginning of a descent into hell,\" Mauricette says.\nThe police visit helped Mathis make sense of flashbacks that had long plagued him, Mauricette says: \"His malaise finally made sense; he traced it to the source.\"\nMathis pressed charges against Le Scouarnec, but the revelations sent him down a spiral which came to an abrupt end on 14 April 2021, when Mathis overdosed and died. He was 24.\nMauricette and her husband pressed charges the very next day, and they are now listed as \"indirect victims\" of Le Scouarnec. They have attended court in Vannes, north-western France, every day since the trial opened on Monday.\nIt has not been an easy listen. \nThe testimony of witnesses - mostly close relatives of Le Scouarnec, now 74 \u2013 painted a picture of an apparently ordinary middle-class family which, behind the scenes, has been ravaged by child abuse, incest and sexual violence.\nAnnie, Le Scouarnec's sister, said she had been \"taught to keep quiet\". \nThis week, it was all brought out in the open. \nAll three sons of Le Scouarnec struck an almost apologetic tone as they told the court about their happy childhoods with a cultured, intellectual father who may not have been particularly present but who was kind, patient and supportive. \n\"We had holidays, nice houses - everything that constitutes a normal family,\" said one.\nThe youngest son \u2013 who said he stopped contact with Le Scouarnec in 2017 \"to preserve the image of him I have from my childhood\" \u2013 said he now \"looked upon everyone with distrust\" and never left his own toddler alone with anybody. \n\"I am always worried that if my father could do this then my neighbour could, my partner, anyone,\" the 37-year-old said.\nLater the middle son \u2013 a tall man in his early 40s who admitted he was a \"not totally abstinent alcoholic\" \u2013 shared his memories of being abused at the hands of his paternal grandfather, Le Scouarnec's father.\nHe was shocked as he was told for the first time in court that among his father's alleged victims were some of his childhood friends.\nAnd, on Friday, a stunned silence descended upon the courtroom as Le Scouarnec admitted he had abused his granddaughter - his eldest son's daughter when she was under five years old. Moments after the revelation, the 44-year-old and his partner left the room to be assisted by a psychologist.\nOther witnesses sparked consternation in the plaintiffs. Due to their sheer number, they sit in a separate room \u2013 a former university lecture hall \u2013 and follow proceedings via video link.\nChristian D., a friend of Le Scouarnec now aged 80, often answered questions from the court sarcastically and repeatedly minimised the events at the centre of the trial, declaring that he could not \"afford to cry over everything that happened in the world\".\nLater, he insisted that he \"never saw anything, therefore had nothing to say\" about the devastating allegations against his friend. When he stated that he would take in Le Scouarnec if he was ever to leave jail, many alleged victims in the lecture hall got up and left their seats.\nBut most difficult for Mauricette and Roland was the much-awaited testimony of Marie-France L., Le Scouarnec's ex-wife.\nIt has been alleged that she was at the centre of the omerta that reigned in the Le Scouarnec family, as she was repeatedly made aware of her husband's obsession with children but did nothing to stop it.\nMany lawyers and plaintiffs now believe she could have spared hundreds of children from being abused. Le Scouarnec's brother - who was also heard this week - openly wondered whether she had been too enamoured by the lifestyle provided by her husband's salary to speak out.\nMarie-France has always denied this and, at the stand, was frequently defiant in the face of the accusations levelled at her.\n\"Catastrophe has struck: she knows I am a paedophile,\" Le Scouarnec wrote as early as the mid-1990s in his diary. \"Perhaps he was talking about his conscience,\" Marie-France told the court.\nShe also suggested her five-year-old niece \u2013 who Le Scouarnec has been convicted of raping \u2013 had most likely \"manipulated\" her husband. \n\"She's devious, that one. She loves the attention,\" she said. Later, she complained that she was being \"blamed\" for everything. Only when she was shown an indecent photo montage Le Scouarnec made of their son as a child did she look visibly shocked.\n\"That was absolute theatre,\" Mauricette told the BBC, adding that Christian D.'s testimony had been \"vile\" and that she thought Marie-France was living in \"pure denial\".\nAs the gut-wrenching events played out, Le Scouarnec sat in his box \u2013 mostly reactionless, but at times noticeably agitated, his voice cracking as he asked his sons for forgiveness. He flinched when excerpts of his diary were read out, and averted his eyes as indecent photographs he took of his nieces were shown.\nHis lawyers have said he admits to the \"majority\" of the charges against him, and that he will explain himself over the course of the trial, which is due to last until June. \nThe alleged victims will take the stand from next week; Mauricette and Roland will do so in April. \"I will look at Le Scouarnec and tell him what is deep in my heart - he killed my grandson,\" Mauricette says.\n\"Not with a gun, but he killed him,\" she adds. \"He's going to get 20 years, but his victims... will have to live with this their whole lives.\n\"Their sentences will be longer than his.\"\nThroughout the week, over in the victims' hall, people came and went, but the majority stayed for hours on end each day.\nAs descriptions of trauma and abuse poured in, one middle-aged woman covered her face with her hand and kept it there a long time. \nNext to her, a young man rubbed his eyes repeatedly, then stood up and left.",

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation \u2013 with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

It sells ice creams and drinks for an average of six Chinese yuan ($0.82; \u00a30.65).The company was founded in 1997 by Zhang Hongchao, a student at Henan University of Finance and Economics, as a part time job to help his family's finances.Its full name M\u00ecxu\u011b B\u012bngch\u00e9ng means \"honey snow ice city\", with its stores adorned with its Snow King mascot and playing the firm's official theme tune on a loop.According to Mixue, it has more than 45,000 stores across China and 11 other countries, including Singapore and Thailand. The firm has also said it plans to continue expanding.That compares to \"over 43,000 locations\" for McDonald's and Starbucks' 40,576 outlets.While it is often seen as China's biggest bubble tea, iced drinks, and ice cream chain, it operates more like a raw-materials supplier than a traditional brand.Unlike Starbucks, which operates more than half of its stores directly, almost all of Mixue's outlets are run by franchisees.Mixue's strong market debut contrasts with smaller rival Guming, which saw shares slide on its first day of trading in February.Last year, shares in the owner of bubble tea chain Chabaidao also fell on their market debut.

They responded that he was being \"disrespectful\".\nAfter his departure, Zelensky said Ukraine is \"ready to sign the minerals agreement\" but continued his call for US security guarantees.\nThe exchange prompted a series of responses from European leaders with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz among those reiterating their support for Ukraine.\nPosting on X on Friday, First Minister John Swinney said: \"Today's events in Washington are a clear cause for deep concern, for shock, for anger. \n\"What we need now are cool heads and clear thinking.

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I accept what I did was awful' - 'Steve'\nWarning: this article contains offensive language\nSteve was leaving the football ground when he shouted back at some away fans. Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

There are different calculations on US spending in or related to Ukraine - and they produce a much lower figure.\nThe Kiel Institute is a German-based think tank tracking support going into Ukraine.  It calculated that the United States spent $119.7bn (\u00a394.3bn) on aid between January 2022 and December 2024.\nOthers have reached a higher figure - but with a broader definition of what counts as spending on Ukraine.\nThe US Department of Defense has provided a figure looking at all spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nIt says $182.8bn has been \"appropriated\" - a figure that covers US military training in Europe and replenishment of US defence stocks.\nEither way, both figures are considerably lower than claimed by the president.\nWe asked the White House about the basis for the $350bn claim. So far, it hasn't provided an explanation.\nPresident Trump has claimed: \"We've spent more than $300bn and Europe has spent about $100bn - that's a big difference\"\nShort answer: Figures suggest Europe has spent more when all aid is included and, as above, we can't find any evidence for the $300bn figure.\nThe United States is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the United States, according to the Kiel Institute.\nThe figure includes aid directly from the European Union, but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid.\nThey calculate that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine. In the same period, the United States spent $119.7bn, according to their figures.\nNATO secretary general Mark Rutte made a similar argument, adding Canada into his calculation.\nMr Rutte said February 2025: \"In 2024, NATO Allies provided over 50 billion euros in security assistance to Ukraine \u2013 nearly 60% of this coming from Europe and Canada.\"\nWe asked for NATO's figures, but they said they were classified.\nThis is a claim President Trump made when he hosted President Macron. It prompted President Macron to disagree, saying both Europe and the US had given a mixture of grants and loans.\nShort answer: The EU has provided loans, but also grants. \nPresident Macron is correct, according to Kiel figures. But they suggest President Trump also has a point; the US has sent more grants, while the EU sent more loans.\nHowever, again, there are different figures out there.\nThe European Union says EU countries have provided around $145bn in aid so far and that just 35% of that has been loans. Like the United States Department of Defence, the EU has used a broader definition of what counts as aid to Ukraine.\nEU loans will have been on generous terms - so Ukraine will be repaying less interest than it would normally. In some cases, Ukraine isn't expected to pay anything, with repayments coming from revenues from frozen Russian assets.\nWhat we can say is that aid to Ukraine has been a mixture of loans and grants.\nThe UK is one of the biggest individual state donors to Ukraine - the latest was a $2.8bn (\u00a32.26bn) loan agreement signed during President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to London on 1 March.\nThe only countries to have spent more are the United States and Germany, according to Kiel data.\nBut the UK contributions are much smaller than the United States.\nThat raises a question for the UK and other European countries; if the United States withdraws a large part of its funding to Ukraine, can other states make up the difference?\nThat would require a significant increase in their contributions.\n\nAdditional reporting: Thomas Spencer and Tamara Kovacevic\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",

In Sri Lanka's central highlands, the weather may be capricious but what remains unchanged is the sprawling expanse of tea estates in every direction.\u00a0\nThis region is where the bulk of soothing Ceylon tea comes from. And the recently opened Pekoe Trail, Sri Lanka's first long-distance hiking trail that runs for more than 300km through tea plantations, villages and forests, tells the story of Sri Lanka's complex and chequered tea history. This hiking trail, divided into 22 stages, begins in Sri Lanka's second largest city of Kandy, close to the area where Scotsman James Taylor first planted tea in the country in the mid-1800s. After a long and circuitous route, it finally ends in the hill town of Nuwara Eliya, whose cool climes and misty slopes are said to have reminded the British colonisers of Blighty (Britain).\u00a0\nThe trail has existed in patches since those initial days of tea cultivation in Sri Lanka, beginning as basic mud tracks that were used to transport the leaves to factories and then onward to domestic markets and Colombo port for export. For Pekoe Trail founder and sustainable tourism consultant Miguel Cunat, creating this multi-stage, multi-day hike was a labour of love, involving nearly 10 years of research and exploration.\n\"My initial objective was to promote Sri Lanka as a world-class hiking destination,\" says the Spaniard and long-time Sri Lanka resident, who was keen to put the small island back on the tourism map after a disastrous spell with Covid and the subsequent economic crisis. His efforts came to fruition with the official opening of the Pekoe Trail in late 2023, with initial funding from the European Union and USAID.\n\"The trails are fairly easy, at low elevation and open all through the year. In that sense, this hike is for everyone,\" he explains. That means everyone, including novice hikers such as myself, have the option to stay in a hotel near the trail and go out on exploratory day hikes within a single stage. I also come to understand later from my trail guides that most visitors choose to do this instead of attempting the trail in its entirety.\nSet Out\nSet Out is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.\nAnd although tea is the common thread stitching this story together, each stage has its own unique elements \u2013 a colonial-era cricket club here, a seasonal waterfall there, statues of brightly coloured village deities, Anglican churches with brilliant stained-glass windows, distant views of a sharp peak or clusters of wildflowers blooming in the midst of a barren stretch. Cathy Cruse, a 62-year-old Australian hiker who recently set a record by completing the entire trail in seven days, agrees, saying, \"You've got the tea plantations and then you're going into thick jungle and then pine forests, and then at one stage I thought I was walking through Australia, with all the tall eucalyptus trees.\"\nCunat's objective was also to bring tourist attention and money into the hinterlands and hill towns located away from the popular coastal destinations of Sri Lanka's south or the Buddhist Cultural Triangle of Anuradhapura, Sigiriya and Dambulla. Cruse, who is married to a Sri Lankan, says that she has visited Kandy and Nuwara Eliya several times but never had a chance \u2013 or indeed, a reason \u2013 to explore the more interior parts of the tea country.\nAs Cunat walked along the various trails, he also began to see a larger picture emerging from the network of villages and communities along the way. \"Along with nature, there is so much history and living heritage, with local fairs and festivals, and opportunities to see how [rural Sri Lankans] live and work,\" he says. And it is this aspect I most enjoy about my hikes \u2013 I am never too far from civilisation, be it a local temple or a tea factory, and I get to have regular interactions with friendly plantation workers and curious children everywhere. It is perhaps why Cruse stresses how safe the trail is for solo or women hikers. \"When I pick a trail, I'm looking for somewhere safe that a woman can tackle on her own and not feel intimidated. Not once did I ever feel nervous of my surroundings or my guides on the Pekoe Trail,\" she says.\nThe history of tea in Sri Lanka is inextricably linked with the Indian-Tamil plantation workers brought by the British. Their descendants \u2013 mostly women \u2013 still form the backbone of the lowest levels of tea production. Dressed in frayed button-down shirts and thick long skirts to protect from leeches, they spend their lives picking the finest leaves from the bushes. I see them walking up and down the tea estates, their hands nimble with years of practice, their necks bent with the load of the bamboo baskets tied to their heads, into which they carefully toss the leaves.\nThe best of 2025\nSri Lanka was named one of BBC Travel's 25 best places to visit in 2025, a list highlighting destinations that are not only welcoming visitors, but using tourism as a force for good.\u00a0See the full list here.\nThe women beam in delight when I speak to them in Tamil. \"Tell me about India,\" third-generation tea picker Sathyavathy demands, when I stop to chat with her group during their mid-morning tea break in the Bogawantalawa area, known as the \"Golden Valley\" due to its fine quality of tea. \"Is it beautiful?\" Like many of her peers, she has distant family back in the small towns of Tamil Nadu in South India but has never visited the country.\nMy initial hikes take me through stages seven and eight near Hatton in the heart of the tea country, dotted with old factories that still process tea using dated technology, and boutique hotels repurposed from massive bungalows once meant for estate managers. My guide here is Dharsharuban Rathnasingham, a young man whose grandparents and mother used to work in these very tea plantations.\u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0 The rise of the slow swimming holiday\n\u2022\u00a0 A hike through history on Britain's oldest road\n\u2022\u00a0 Sri Lanka's most beautiful train journey\nRuban \u2013 as he likes being called \u2013 is passionate about sharing the stories of his people, Indian Tamils who populate the villages and towns around the various stages of the Pekoe Trail. As we walk, he stops to point out the elements distinctive to tea plantation life, like the \"line rooms\", cramped barrack-style quarters where large families lived together (and still do, in some places); and the statues of fierce Tamil protector deities placed at major crossroads or beneath trees, often depicted riding a horse or wielding a scythe.\nFrom Hatton, I take the famed Colombo to Badulla train to Ella, from where I attempt to tackle stages 15 and 16 over the next several days, taking in the viewpoint known as Ella Rock and the picturesque nine-arch railway bridge. Here, the tea goes in and out of view, with some stretches taking me over active railway tracks and others on paths shaded by tall eucalyptus and pine trees. The Pekoe Trail may be long and even tough in parts, but it is never boring or monotonous.\nAs Cruse says, \"There were just so many 'wow' moments during the hike, where you come around a corner, and the whole valley would just be laid out below and I would have to stop and just stare.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

What are they thinking?\"\nHe also accused Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky of not wanting peace adding: \"America will not put up with it for much longer.\"\nFollowing a summit of western leaders over the weekend, the UK and France said they would produce a plan to stop the fighting, which would then be discussed with the US.\nAddressing MPs, Sir Keir said Britain would \"play a leading role\" in any agreed deal including, if necessary, deploying British troops in Ukraine to deter Russia from further attacks. \nTrump has so far not agreed to provide any security guarantees and has instead focused on a deal to open up Ukrainian minerals to US companies.\nHe has argued that the presence of American workers in the country would help discourage Russia from trying to encroach on Ukraine territory.\nAsked by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage if the minerals deal would provide \"enough of a security guarantee\", Sir Keir said the deal \"is not enough on its own\". \nThe prime minister received widespread backing from MPs across different parties, with Conservative former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly saying he had \"not put a foot wrong\" over the weekend. \nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she backed the PM's decision to fund an increase in defence spending by cutting the aid budget and added that she would support him to make further \"difficult choices - including on welfare\". \nSpeaking about the deployment of British troops, the prime minister said he did not take any such move \"lightly\" and promised MPs a vote if that happened. \nHe argued that backing Ukraine was not only \"the right thing to do\" but was also in British interests.\n\"If we do not achieve a lasting peace then the instability and insecurity that hits living standards of working people in Britain, that will only get worse and Putin's appetite for conflict and chaos, that will only grow.\"\nHe later said \"success was not guaranteed but I am not going to let up\". \nRussia has flatly rejected the idea of western troops being sent to Ukraine as part of any peace deal.\nSunday's summit in London came after an explosive spat between Trump and Zelensky at the White House last week.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump was \"no longer a reliable ally with respect to Russia\" and that it was time the UK reviewed its dependency on the US. \n\"I don't agree with him,\" replied Sir Keir, adding: \"The US and UK have the closest of relationships - our defence, security and intelligence are completely intertwined.\n\"A huge mistake at a time like this would be to suggest any weakening of that link is the way forward.\"\nLabour MP - and chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee - Emily Thornberry questioned Sir Keir's decision to cut aid in order to bolster defence spending.\nShe said it was \"hard to believe\" there would be enough left in the budget to \"provide meaningful support\" and it could \"hobble\" the prime minister's attempt to show global leadership. \nAt the weekend, President Macron had suggested a partial, month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine, in which both would agree to a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure, but it would not cover ground fighting along the frontline in the east.\nEl\u00e9onore Caroit, a member of the French foreign affairs committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that President Macron's proposal sent a \"very strong message\" to Europe \"that if we want, we can do something\".\nBut Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC it was \"not a plan that we currently recognise\".\nHe added: \"Certainly there are a number of different options being discussed privately between the UK, France and our allies\u2026 What we are certainly doing is looking at what plan would bring peace as soon as we can, and what plan creates a lasting peace.\"\nThe prime minister hosted the London summit as allies scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.\nAt the summit, Sir Keir announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.\nThe plan involves including Ukraine in talks, continuing to supply it with military aid, boosting its defence capabilities and building a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend a deal to end the fighting.\nThe UK and France are taking a leading role and have both committed to send soldiers to Ukraine, under the proposals.\nBut apart from increasing spending on defence, there appears to be no consensus on a plan to end the war among European leaders.\nDefence Secretary John Healey will visit the US later this week to move discussions forward.\nIn other developments over the weekend:",

        "article_text": "YouTuber Asmita Patel's mission was to \"make India trade\".\nThe wildly popular financial influencer called herself the \"She-Wolf of the stock market\" - her take on the Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street. At last count, she had clocked upwards of half a million subscribers on YouTube and hundreds of thousands on Instagram. Fees for her stock trading courses ran into thousands of rupees.\nLast month, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) put a spanner in the works. It barred her and six others from trading, alleging she was selling illegal stock tips disguised as investor education and making millions of rupees in the bargain.\nThe regulator's crackdown on Patel is its latest attempt to tighten the noose around social media influencers offering quick money schemes and trading advice disguised as education.\nIndia's post-pandemic market boom attracted a wave of new mom-and-pop investors. Online trading accounts grew from merely 36 million in 2019 to more than 150 million last year, data from the brokerage Zerodha shows.\nMany of these first-time market entrants relied on social media for trading tips which, in turn, birthed a new breed of self-styled \"investment gurus\" or \"financial influencers\" like Ms Patel, promising quick money.\nWith only 950 registered investment advisors and 1,400 financial advisors in the country, these influencers quickly filled the void, amassing hundreds of thousands of subscribers and followers.\nMost operated without regulatory registration, blurring the line between investment advice and stock market education. This prompted Sebi to crack down, banning at least a dozen influencers, including a Bollywood actor, from offering trading advice.\nThe regulator has also barred brokerages and market players from partnering with influencers who peddle illegal stock tips or make misleading return claims.\nSebi has also laid down strict guidelines for educators, effectively barring them from offering real-time trading tips or using live market data for educational purposes.\nThe regulator found Ms Patel and her husband, Jitesh, directing students and investors to trade specific stocks through their advisory firm. She allegedly used private Telegram channels, Zoom calls and courses to sell tips without mandatory registration.\nSebi acted in Ms Patel's case after 42 participants complained of trading losses and demanded compensation. It is now moving to seize millions of rupees that Patel and her associates earned from course fees between 2021 and 2024.\nAs markets correct, the economy slows and regulators crack down, other influencers face a credibility test.\nThousands of angry investors have recently accused high-profile influencers of faking their success to sell trading courses and earn millions in brokerage referrals. \nSebi's order in Ms Patel's case too revealed she made just over $13,700 (\u00a310,800) as trading profits in the past five years but earned more than $11.4m (\u00a39m) by selling courses.\nMs Patel didn't respond to the BBC's request for comment.\nWhile Sebi's drive to protect small investors is well intentioned, its recent regulatory actions have drawn criticism for being delayed and lacking clarity.\nThe regulator has been both a \"selective\" and \"reluctant regulator\", Sucheta Dalal,  veteran financial journalist and author, told the BBC.\n\"It should have acted a few years ago when trading sites started paying influencers to promote their products. Now this phenomenon has become too big.\"\nSumit Agrawal, a former officer with Sebi, says the regulator singled out a few as an example instead of enforcing a clear, comprehensive policy.\n\"Curbing unregulated stock tips is necessary, but requiring trading schools to use three-month-old data for educational purposes and not teaching practical experience of trading strategies on live market crosses into over-regulation,\" he says.\nManish Singh, a chartered accountant and YouTuber with half a million followers, makes market analysis videos. He says Sebi's new rules have created confusion over what's allowed.\n\"Even genuine content creators who are trying to guide people in the right direction will lose subscribers and the monetary incentive of brand deals as confidence to work with creators is shaken,\" Singh told the BBC.\nBalancing this will be tough for the regulator, says Mr Agrawal. \nTechnology is inherently disruptive and the law is always \"playing catch-up\". Sebi's real challenge, he adds, is to monitor online content effectively without over-regulating. Notably, the Indian regulator wields broader powers than its counterparts in advanced markets like the US.\n\"It has extensive authority, including search and seizure powers and the ability to ban trading and freeze bank accounts without requiring a court order,\" says Mr Agrawal. \nA Reuters report, citing sources, says the regulator has again sought greater powers - its second request in two years - to access call records and social media chats in investigations into influencer-led market violations. \nThe challenge, say experts, will be to ensure it doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.",

        "article_text": "These were already turbulent times in Romania.\nBut as people here navigate the late winter ice and slush on Bucharest's elegant streets, the abrupt departure of the Tate brothers by private jet has left a fresh trail of confusion and unanswered questions in its wake.\nA country grappling with a cancelled presidential election, its future in Europe, its support for neighbouring Ukraine, widespread corruption, and collapsing faith in public institutions, is now left pondering why two controversial foreigners, facing a raft of complex but serious criminal charges, have been treated with such apparent lenience; their confiscated assets and their passports suddenly returned to them.\nWas a secret deal done between Romania's government and the Trump administration? If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would have been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I accept what I did was awful' - 'Steve'\nWarning: this article contains offensive language\nSteve was leaving the football ground when he shouted back at some away fans. Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

        "article_text": "Andrew Cuomo, who resigned four years ago as New York governor under a cloud of scandal, has declared he is running for mayor of New York City. \n\"Our city is in crisis,\" Cuomo posted in a 17-minute video on X, adding: \"We need government to work. We need effective leadership.\"\nIt heralds a potential political comeback in this year's election for the Democrat, who quit in 2021 amid sexual misconduct allegations and scrutiny of his handling of the Covid pandemic. \nAmerica's most populous city is in a state of political turmoil as current Mayor Eric Adams denies claims he struck a deal to help the Trump administration with migrant raids in exchange for dropping a federal corruption case against him. \nThe former governor joins an already crowded contest, which includes lawmakers, young newcomers and Mayor Adams himself, though it is Cuomo who has the most name recognition. \nThe three-term governor resigned after an investigation found he had sexually harassed 11 women, including state employees.\nThe state-led inquiry determined he had made sexual comments, inappropriately touched or groped the women and kissed them without consent.\nAt the time, President Joe Biden led calls from Democrats for the embattled Cuomo to step down, and state lawmakers raised the prospect of impeachment.\nWhen the governor left office, he denied harassing anyone, but said he wanted to \"deeply, deeply\" apologise to any women who might have been offended by his actions.\nCuomo's stunning downfall happened a year after he basked in the adulation of millions of Americans who had tuned in daily to his no-nonsense televised briefings on the coronavirus pandemic.\nBut a report in 2022 found that under his administration, the state hid at least 4,100 Covid-related nursing home deaths from the public.\nCuomo admitted to a \"delay\" in reporting, but denied allegations that his administration purposely misled New Yorkers.\nOpinion polling by New York media in recent weeks has projected that Cuomo would become frontrunner if he entered the mayoral race.\nDays before the campaign was launched, Cuomo received the surprise backing of congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents the Bronx.\n\"Andrew Cuomo has the competence to govern the city. He has the courage to stand up to extremist politics - both from the far left and far right,\" he told the New York Post.\n\"We don't need a Mr Nice Guy. We need a Mr Tough Guy.\"\nCuomo's supporters have also launched a political action committee called Fix the City, which states it aims to raise $15m (\u00a312m) for his campaign war chest.\nOne of Cuomo's former aides who accused him of sexual harassment told the New York Post on Saturday that she fears women's rights will suffer if he wins election.\n\"New York City may elect a mayor who has been rightfully accused of sexual misconduct by several young women who worked for him in up-close positions,\" said Karen Hinton.\n\"As a movement, we women haven't done enough to toughen laws to protect women from such immoral, unethical, and what should be illegal behaviour by men in positions of power, such as Cuomo.\"\nThe Democratic primary vote will take place in June. The eventual winner is expected to defeat any Republican challenger during November's election and become the city's next mayor.\nAdams has chosen to remain in the race, even while facing federal fraud, bribery and other charges. \nThe Trump administration is seeking to dismiss the charges, arguing that the charges have damaged the mayor's ability to aid the president's agenda and were politically motivated. \nThe attempt caused Manhattan's lead prosecutor and six other high-level federal prosecutors in New York to resign in protest, saying there was no legal justification for the White House directive to end the prosecution.\nMeanwhile, the judge in the case has cancelled the upcoming trial in April as he works to decide whether the case should be dropped or not. \nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul, who took over for Cuomo after he resigned, said last month that she was declining to use her authority to replace Adams, at least for now, and would instead move to limit his authority.\nAdams has denied making a \"quid pro quo\" with Trump's office to help in the removal of illegal migrants, last month calling the assertion \"silly\".\nAdams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. He denies the charges.\nHis office has been plagued by staff departures and scandals, even before charges were pressed against him. A number of figures in his orbit have also been indicted as part of the investigation.",

And to face them at a top level, it's a privilege to be here.\n\"We've lost, but to be able to be here and give it a go and know what it's like in that battle, in that washing machine, it's been worth that 70 minutes.\"\nThe size of the defeat clearly hurt.\n\"There are always positives to take,\" Cunningham said. \"Right now, it's tough to focus on them, but I think the heart was there, the effort was there, we didn't give up. \n\"I think Georgia Roche getting a try for us right at the end shows that we didn't give up. The effort was there. It was just that they were too good for us. \n\"But I'm proud of the girls.

But we've got a great squad, we've got a great group of staff and we're willing to put that hard work in to get better.\"\nIn a recent interview with BBC Sport, former Great Britain head coach Jackie Sheldon highlighted the investment Australia have put into their women's game over the past two decades as a key factor in their international dominance - they have won the past three World Cups, and lost just once since 2016.\nShe suggested England have to find a way to compete physically with Australia and New Zealand in order to be able to challenge them.\nGiven the disparity in investment between the domestic game in England and Australia, that may not be a quick process. It may be helped, though, by the experience gained by English players who have moved to the NRLW: Roche plays her club rugby for Newcastle Knights, and Hollie-Mae Dodd for Canberra Raiders, while Paige Travis will start the coming season with Parramatta Eels, having switched from St Helens.\nPerhaps, in time, the painful memories of Vegas will make England better too. As Hardcastle put it: \"The result's hard, but there's a lot we can look at individually, and think: what do we need to do to be better?\"",

        "article_text": "Southern California is frequently shaken by earthquakes. How they feel to people living in Los Angeles has a lot to do with the sediment-filled basin the city sits upon.\nHollywood stars were just starting to arrive at their afterparties following the Oscars when the ground suddenly jolted. There were a few screams and high-rise buildings reportedly wobbled.\u00a0\nThe magnitude 3.9 earthquake that hit North Hollywood on 2 March 2025 was the latest in a number of jolts to have hit the area. The earthquake was measured to have occurred at a depth of around 9 miles (15km), but was felt in parts of the city several miles away. Another much smaller\u00a0magnitude 1.3 earthquake was detected almost in the same location a few hours later. No damage to buildings was reported.\nIt wasn't a terribly unusual event, by California's standards. The state is the\u00a0second-most seismically active\u00a0in\u00a0the United States behind Alaska, with Southern California experiencing an\u00a0earthquake on average every three minutes. In the week leading up to the post-Oscars quake, 36 earthquakes occured in the LA area, with most being under magnitude 2.0.\u00a0While most are too small to be felt, around\u00a015-20 events exceed magnitude 4.0 each year.\nThe most recent occured a little over an hour after sunset on 6 August 2024, when a sparsely populated belt of farmland near Bakersfield, Southern California, was shaken from a restful evening. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake, followed by hundreds of smaller aftershocks, shuddered through the area as a fault near the southern end of the Central Valley ruptured \u2013 the largest earthquake to hit Southern California in three years. The epicenter was about 17 miles (27km) south of Bakersfield and people reported shaking nearly 90 miles (145km) away in portions of Los Angeles and as far away as San Diego. Then, a few days later, another jolt rattled the Los Angeles area due to a rupture on a small section of the dangerous Puente Hills fault system. The resulting magnitude 4.4 earthquake had its epicentre just four miles northeast of the city's downtown area.\nAlthough there was minimal damage caused by both quakes in August 2024 and the less severe shake in Hollywood in March 2025, they highlighted just how the geology under California's largest city can alter the effects of fault movements in the area. The relatively shallow depth of the 6 August earthquake appeared to create more intense or prolonged shaking in some parts of the city, while others felt almost nothing at all.\nThere are various reasons for why this might be \u2013 including what people were doing at the time of the earthquake \u2013 but the enormous five-mile-deep (8km), sediment-filled basin that LA is built upon plays a surprising role in the effects felt above ground.\nWhile the ground feels steadfast at the surface, deeply buried bedrock can resemble a shattered window pane. These cracks, or faults, are where earthquakes occur. Faults are put under tremendous stress by the slow and steady movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.\nIn California, the North American plate and the Pacific Plate are grinding past each other along the infamous San Andreas fault, averaging about 30-50 millimeters (1-2 inches) every year. The movement is anything but fluid. Cracked rocks are rough and wedge against each other, sometimes staying stuck for thousands of years. Over time, stress created by the slow marching tectonic plates builds up and when the fault reaches its stress limit, it \"slips\" and ruptures, causing an earthquake. \u00a0\nA rupture begins at one location and travels in one direction along the fault, stretching up to hundreds of kilometers. The longest rupture ever recorded was a 994 mile (1,600km) portion of a fault that caused the Great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and resulting tsunami on Boxing Day 2004. \"The farther it goes, the longer [the earthquake] lasts, and the more energy that's released. So the longer the fault, the bigger the earthquake,\" explains seismologist Lucy Jones, a researcher at the California Institute of Technology and former seismologist with the US Geological Survey.\nDuring an earthquake, the stored energy saved within the sticky fault is released suddenly. Seismic waves radiate out from the rupture like the ripples created by throwing a rock into a pond, spreading in all directions through the surrounding rock and earth.\u00a0\nThe magnitude of an earthquake tells scientists about the length of the ruptured fault as well as the duration of shaking, says Jones. But the intensity of an earthquake \u2013 the ground motions we feel at a location \u2013 is shaped by how close we are to the epicenter, which direction the fault ruptured, and the geological layers under our feet.\nLos Angeles is located south of a giant a bend in the San Andreas fault where the plate boundary clearly changes direction. \"If you see it from the air, it's amazing,\" says Jones. \"It's so bizarre \u2013 you can look down and see the fault valley and then it just turns.\"\nAround the turn, the region is chock full of faults. Over millions of years, the faults churned and pushed slabs of bedrock into multiple mountain ranges and deep basins. Gravity, water and wind act like sandpaper, wearing down the mountains, and carrying debris into the basins. Over time, the basins have been filled with sediment.\nThe bowl-shaped basin of rock under Los Angeles is up to five miles (8km) deep, filled with a mixture of gravel, sand and clay. The contrast between the hard rock and softer sediment are big factors that cause some seismic weirdness for cities like Los Angeles.\nDuring an earthquake, seismic waves are modulated by geology, says John Vidale, professor of seismology at University of Southern California. \"The primary factor is just how hard is the ground and how deep is the structure that has soft [material] near the surface,\" he says. Seismic waves will move faster in denser material like rock, versus softer and less dense sediment.\nAs seismic waves travel through the basin, their behaviour changes when they encounter the loose sediment. \"[The wave] is now having to travel at a much slower speed, but it still has to carry the same amount of energy per unit time,\" said Jones. As the wave slogs through the sediment, the amplitude, or wave height, gets bigger.\nPut another way, imagine the Los Angeles basin as a giant bowl of jelly \u2013 the dense rocky mountains and underlying rock make up the bowl, while the sediment fill is represented by the gelatinous mixture. \"If you shake the bottom [of the bowl] a little bit, the top flops back and forth quite a bit,\" says Vidale. And atop this quivering mass of jelly is the megacity of Los Angeles.\nThis means the amplitude of the waves within a basin can be significantly bigger than those moving through rock. In one study, researchers using earthquake measurements in the Los Angeles region from the 1992 Landers earthquake found that seismic waves inside the Los Angeles basin were three to four times larger than sites outside the basin.\nIn addition to amplification, seismic waves can also reverberate within a sediment-filled basin. Think back to that shaking bowl of jelly and how the flopping top bounces off the sides of the bowl. Scientists from the Statewide California Earthquake Center simulated earthquakes in the Los Angeles region and found that the basin can trap seismic wave energy in a similar way. This reverberation can mean shaking can often go on for longer than the duration of the fault rupture itself, increasing the hazard for the city built on top.\nAs if that wasn't enough for Los Angeles, the close proximity of the San Bernadino and San Gabriel Basins to the Los Angeles Basins can create a funneling effect, directing seismic waves towards Los Angeles.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Will we ever be able to predict earthquakes?\n\u2022\u00a0The animals that can predict disasters\n\u2022\u00a0How your mobile phone can detect earthquakes\nEven within a basin, there can be differences in how the sediment interacts with seismic waves. \"There's variability in the shaking\u2026 there's variations in the geology,\" says Vidale. Sediment in the upper 330ft (100m) of the basin tends to be looser and less dense than the deeper, compacted sediment below. Sediment changes can also happen quickly at the surface. \"Old stream channels, for example, can be filled with a kind of wet, soft material,\" Vidale says. \"So, if you happen to be in an old stream channel, you'll get hit a lot harder than somebody even a quarter mile away that's on firmer ground.\"\nEven those in the same house can have different experiences, especially if the earthquake is on the smaller side. \"I'm in Pasadena, on the sediment in the San Gabriel Valley,\" say Jones. Despite both being in the house, she and her husband had different experiences of the earthquake on 6 August 2024. \"I felt it, my husband didn't,\" she says.\nWhile the city of Los Angeles ticks a lot of seismic hazard boxes, it is not the only urban center that needs to worry. Throughout human history, people have tended to build cities on flat ground near water bodies.\nIt just so happens that these sites tend to form above geologic basins and sometimes near faults.\u00a0\nWhile the US has a few famous cities built on basins \u2013 Seattle, Portland, and Salt Lake City \u2013 there are many others around the world that experience amplified seismic waves due to where they are situated. After the European settlers drained Lake Texcoco in the 1500s, Mexico City was built on the flat, old lake bottom. In 1985 and 2017, the city experienced significant damage from earthquakes that shook the basin sediments.\nThe desert megacity of Tehran in Iran also sits atop a geologic basin filled with river sediments, and there is growing concern about the risk of a major earthquake in the area.\nUnderstanding the earthquake risk is the first step in bolstering protection for a city against significant shaking. Enacting robust building codes can be another way to protect people and infrastructure, but it often takes a major event for stricter regulations to be implemented. After the devastating earthquake in 1985, for example, Mexico City enacted stringent building codes, and retrofitted older buildings.\u00a0\n\"The very first earthquake codes [in California] went in after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake,\" adds Jones. At that time, schools were built out of firesafe, unreinforced brick. \"Seventy schools were completely destroyed \u2013 luckily, it was at six o'clock at night,\" says Jones. The horror of collapsing schools spurred regulation, but initial codes were meagre. \"They basically just said, 'don't build unreinforced masonry in California'. \u00a0That was sort of the first basic code.\"\nToday, assessing earthquake risks is a lot more nuanced.\nIn the US, a team of seismologists, geoscientists and geophysicists have created a seismic hazard map, showing the chances of a damaging earthquake shaking in the next 100 years. In their latest version of the report, the team found that that nearly 75% of the US could experience damaging shaking. To help policymakers and engineers, the team included information on the implications for building and structural designs.\nWhile building codes can protect lives, scientists like Jones want building codes to go further. Designing buildings so they can be more easily repaired rather than needing to be demolished would cost an extra 1% in the construction phase, Jones estimates. \"We're calling it 'functional recovery',\" she says.\n\"We are trying to say that 'just not killing you' is an insufficient standard. The reality is, if your building's badly damaged and now has to be torn down after the earthquake, you've hurt your tenants, you've hurt your neighbors, you've hurt the local economy.\"\nFortunately, the buildings of Los Angeles rode out the latest quakes to rattle Southern California pretty well. But at some point, the city won't be so lucky.\n* This article was originally published on 18 August 2024.

        "article_text": "Urine was used as fertiliser in ancient Rome and China. Now farmers in Vermont are bringing this practice back to boost harvests and grow crops in a more sustainable way.\nWhen Betsy Williams goes to the loo, she likes to know her pee won't go to waste. For the last 12 years, she and her neighbours in rural Vermont, US, have diligently collected their urine and donated it to farmers for use as fertiliser for their crops.\n\"We're consuming all of these things that have nutrients in them, and then a lot of the nutrients that are passing through us can then get recycled back into helping create food for us and for animals. So to me, it's logical,\" Williams says.\nWilliams takes part in the Urine Nutrient Reclamation Program (UNRP), a programme run by the Rich Earth Institute (REI), a non-profit based in Vermont. She and 250 of her neighbours in Windham County donate a total of 12,000 gallons (45,400 litres) of urine to the programme each year to be recycled \u2013 or \"peecycled\".\u00a0\nWindham County's pee-donations are collected by a lorry and driven to a large tank where the urine is pasteurised by heating it to 80C (176F) for 90 seconds. It is then stored in a pasteurised tank, ready to be sprayed on local farmland when the time is right to fertilise crops.\nRecords suggest that urine was used to help grow crops back in ancient China and\u00a0ancient Rome. Today, scientists are finding that it can\u00a0more than double the yield of crops like kale and spinach compared to no fertiliser, and improve yields even in low fertility soils.\nUrine's power as a fertiliser is due to the nitrogen and phosphorus that it contains \u2013 the same nutrients that are added to the synthetic fertilisers used on many conventional farms. But these synthetic fertilisers come at an environmental cost. Nitrogen is produced using the fossil fuel-intensive Haber-Bosch process, and the mining of phosphorus creates harmful amounts of toxic waste. Urine, meanwhile, is freely available \u2013\u00a0as Williams puts it, \"everybody pees. [It's an] untapped resource\".\nNancy Love, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan who has collaborated with the team at REI over the last decade, has found that using urine instead of standard synthetic fertiliser reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and requires around half the amount of water. Indeed, since 2012, UNRP estimates that it has conserved over 2.7 million gallons (10.2 million litres) of water through preventing toilet flushes.\n\"I've always been a systems thinker, and our [water] system has inefficiencies in it,\" Love says. \"What we do today is dilute the hell out of our urine, we put it in a pipe, we send it to a treatment plant, and then we pump a bunch more energy into it, just to send it back into the environment in a reactive form.\"\nIn the case of urine's nutrients, its typical destination is waterways. The nitrogen and phosphorus in urine are not fully removed from wastewater when it is treated. When these nutrients find their way into rivers and lakes, they are taken up by algae. The result can be\u00a0algal blooms that choke up waterways, unbalancing the ecosystem and killing other species that live there.\n\"Our bodies create a lot of nutrients, and right now those nutrients are not only wasted, but they\u2019re actually causing a lot of problems and harm downstream,\" says Jamina Shupack, REI's executive director.\nThese nutrients are food for algae \u2013\u00a0but also for crops. \"Wherever you put nitrogen, it's going to help plants grow. So if it's in the water, it's helping the algae grow. But if it's on the land, it's going to help plants grow,\u201d Shupack explains. Because of this, diverting nutrient-rich urine away from waterways and onto the land can prevent harmful algal blooms while helping farmers grow food.\nImportantly, the REI team and the farmers they work with take steps to minimise how much of the urine runs off the land and into waterways. Application is carefully timed, so that it happens when the plant is most able to take up the nutrients \u2013 typically during the plant's more active growth stage, when it's bigger than a seedling but not yet fruiting. The soil moisture is also measured, to make sure the liquid urine will be absorbed. Despite these efforts, \"that doesn't mean that there isn't going to be runoff\", Shupack says.\nEven so, she adds, peecycling reduces the overall amount of nutrients entering waterways because it ensures that runoff from the land is the only way excess nutrients enter rivers and lakes. In the current system, synthetic fertilisers run off into waterways, as well as urine entering rivers directly via wastewater.\nThe UNRP in Vermont is pioneering peecycling in the US, but projects in other countries are also underway. In Paris, volunteers are collecting urine to help save the River Seine and fertilise wheat for baguettes and biscuits. Swedish entrepreneurs saw the harm caused by algal blooms around the island of Gotland and came up with a product that collects urine and turns it into fertiliser. Peecycling pilots have also run in South Africa, Nepal and Niger Republic.\nBut expanding this work comes with challenges. Shupack says that in Vermont, farmers' demand for urine outstrips supply \u2013\u00a0but scaling up collection is tricky. Regulation can create a barrier, she says. \"A lot of times you go to a regulator and they say: 'We don't have a form for urine \u2013 the only place I know where to put urine is with biosolids, or within wastewater treatment.' So it's not really categorised in a way that would make sense to do what we're doing,\" she says.\nTo overcome this, Shupack says that REI have got to grips with the detailed language of regulations so they could spot possible paths and partnered with organisations with existing permits \u2013\u00a0such as septic haulers \u2013\u00a0to tackle the different parts of the process, and the permits needed, in a piecemeal way.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The farmers protecting Nepal's snow leopards\n\u2022\u00a0The rewilded golf courses teeming with life\n\u2022\u00a0The beer sludge being turned into vegan milk\nEamon Twohig, programme manager at Vermont's Department of Environmental Conservation (VTDEC), tells the BBC that when REI initially approached them \"it was clear there was no 'regulatory box' for urine treatment/recycling\u2026 REI has certainly blazed a trail here in Vermont, and I think we've managed to find a workable, regulatory pathway.\"\nREI has a good relationship with regulators in Vermont, Shupack says, and has all the permits needed to operate \u2013\u00a0including one for innovative on-site wastewater management, and a waste-hauling permit for transporting urine. Now the organisation is working with partners in Massachusetts and Michigan to move regulation on. \"We're really trying to push that forward. But it's not always easy to get new environmental regulations updated,\" Shupack says. One of the biggest challenges, she adds, is that there is no legal distinction between human waste that has been separated at source, and combined wastewater flows that often come with greater safety concerns.\u00a0\nThere are other limitations too. Urine is heavy and cumbersome to transport,\u00a0and the lorries collecting and moving it create emissions. Currently the urine in Vermont is transported locally, no more than around 10 miles (16km). But expanding peecycling programmes could involve moving urine across bigger distances, so REI's spinoff company has developed a freeze concentration system that concentrates urine by six times, and is currently being used at the University of Michigan.\nCARBON COUNT\nThe emissions from travel it took to report this story were 0kg CO2. The digital emissions from this story are an estimated 1.2g to 3.6g CO2 per page view.\u00a0Find out more about how we calculated this figure here.\nPlumbing, too, is a particular challenge. Love says that urine separation systems don't rely on flushing in the same way standard toilets do \u2013\u00a0which is great for reducing water use, but is problematic for the plumbing. When water doesn't flow through the system as usual, there is a risk of diseases\u00a0such as Legionnaires.\n\"There are solutions,\" Love says, \"like looped systems in a building. But what it means is the entire plumbing process in a building is different.\" This is something Love and her colleagues and partners are working on, so that new buildings in the US can have urine separation systems installed from the start. \"If we want any hope of sustainable water systems by the end of this century, we have to start getting the early adopters to look at these innovative solutions now,\" she says.\n\u00a0\nThese new systems will have the important goal of making urine donation effortless. Williams began her peecycling efforts using large laundry detergent bottles that travelled in the boot of her car to a central collection tank once a month. Once she was in the habit of collecting urine, Williams didn't like to let it go to waste. \"I didn't even like to go anywhere where I might have to pee and not have a jug with me. It kind of became part of my routine, sort of like wearing a seat belt,\" she says.\nEven so, she has enjoyed the recent installation of a toilet in her home that separates urine (at the front) from other waste (at the back). The urine travels to a tank in her basement, which is pumped out a couple of times each year by a lorry that visits Williams and others in her area that take part in the project. \"It's a nice change not dealing with the messy business of it. Making it easy for people is a biggie,\" Williams says.\nAvoiding mess is also likely to help tackle the \"ick factor\" when it comes to peecycling, says Williams. \"It's icky and it's smelly and it's something we don't talk about,\" she says. But while some may be put off by the idea of dealing with their own waste, REI's research suggests that the ick factor doesn't dominate people's reactions to peecycling. People tend to be open to the idea, Shupack says, but to think that others wouldn't be. \"It's this assumption that everyone else is going to think it's really gross. That initial ick factor is not as big of a deal as people assume it's going to be,\" says Shupack.\nMany people are, however, concerned about pharmaceutical content in the urine. \"It's the biggest question we get,\" Shupack says. REI has conducted research to find out just how much of common drugs like caffeine and the painkiller acetaminophen are evident in vegetables grown using urine fertiliser. The final results are yet to be released, but the preliminary findings suggest the amount of pharmaceuticals in vegetables fertilised with urine to be \"extremely small\". \"You'd have to eat a pretty obscene amount of lettuce, every day, for way longer than you can live\" to get a cup of coffee's worth of caffeine, Shupack says.\nHealth worries and messiness aside, Williams points out that it is our Western attitude to waste that most urgently needs to change. \"Particularly in [the US], people don't really think about where their waste goes. They think about it in terms of recycling and trash to some degree, but not so much in terms of human waste. It's a new frontier for people.\"\nClimate change and water pollution can feel like impossibly big issues, but Williams doesn't let them overwhelm her. Instead, she focuses on what she can do in a small way, in her own home. \"We can just do our part,\" she says. \"We aren't perfect, but we try to at least be responsible in terms of what happens to our bodily waste.\"\u00a0\n--\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the\u00a0Future Earth newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nTMS podcast: Buttler resigns as white-ball captain\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket.

        "article_text": "I'm 48, use social media occasionally, and I'm not very tech-savvy. Until recently I'd never used Telegram.\nBut last year, after meeting the family of Ronan Kanda - the 16-year-old who was killed in a case of mistaken identity by two other teenagers who'd bought a sword and machete online - I decided to figure out how easy it was to buy a knife from social media.\nIt seemed like the children in the case were able to buy huge, deadly weapons with shocking ease.\nSo in spring 2024, I set up several social media accounts in the name of a fake 18-year-old man. He is a Londoner who is friends with a group of young men who carry knives. He thinks he needs one too, to protect himself, and he knows larger knives are more intimidating.\nI got myself a separate mobile so my new searches would not impact my usual browsing algorithms. I started searching for knives, liking and following accounts which offered content.\nThe groups contained images of young men posing with knives, videos of close-ups of the blades, and some had videos of knife fights. Very quickly my new social media accounts started showing me more similar content.\nA familiar pattern emerged. Knives were being advertised in posts on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, with sellers directing buyers in their bio to their Telegram channels - encrypted groups where videos, photos and prices of knives for sale were openly shared.\nWithin hours of starting my searches I found and joined my first Telegram group selling banned weapons. There were zombie knives, machetes, switchblades and swords.\nTwenty-two-inch machetes cost \u00a340 and 24-inch zombie knives were \u00a350 - with new stock arriving soon. The seller was based in Walsall and promised delivery to the Birmingham area for \u00a35. Days later, a message went up saying the machetes and zombie knives had sold out.\nThen a poll went up, asking \"Should I get stab-proof vests?\" Fifty-six subscribers answered. A few weeks later, stab vests were available to buy.\nWithin a few weeks I found more than 10 social media accounts offering illegal knives for sale. It didn't take long for me to learn the slang used for terms like knife seller, flick knife and zombie knife.\nKnives were offered in a range of colours - gold, silver, red and blue being the most common. Sellers uploaded photos of their parcels, naming the courier companies they were using to \"guarantee quick delivery\". In some groups buyers had written reviews after receiving their knives - \"banging quality these\" and \"vouched - nice one bro\".\nThere were deals too. One group offered discounts on bulk buying, \u00a35 off second orders, and the chance for members to win knives and knuckledusters for free. As far as I could see, none of the groups were doing any kind of age verification.\nSome were closed down during the nine months I observed them on Telegram, including one called Shanks R Us. But most of them stayed active the whole time.\nMany routinely posted that they were out of stock, and apologised for the inconvenience.\nIn September 2024, the government introduced legislation making it an imprisonable offence to own or sell zombie-style knives and machetes. This added them to a long list of prohibited knives.\nIt's clear they are now getting harder to get a hold of.\nIn one group, the admin says they are getting zombie knives manufactured and shipped from abroad - Malaysia, Pakistan and China - and it's taking longer than usual. The admin brags that \"all [their] shipments land\", and now they're focusing on \"bulk stock for the future\u2026 meaning the knives should be cheaper\".\nBut despite this, the trade is still going strong. On 14 February, I see a message on a group that's grown from zero to 600 members in just a few months reading: \"Happy Valentine's Day to da ladies out there, grab your mans a tool for Valentine's Day, make sure he's safe.\"\nMany of the knives being sold are clearly illegal - but some aren't.\nThe sale of legal knives over Telegram is not technically forbidden, as you don't need a licence or registration to sell them. It is, however, illegal to publish material encouraging the use of a knife as a weapon.\nIn spring 2025, the Home Office intends to launch a consultation into a registration scheme for selling knives online - which would require sellers of all knives, including regular kitchen knives, to sign up.\nThe Offensive Weapons Act states that there should be a system in place for age verification on sale and for delivery, but there's no evidence that this takes place in the social media groups I've been in.\nI contacted the social media platforms to ask what they were doing to curb this harmful content.\nSnapchat said selling weapons, including knives, was explicitly banned on the platform and that it actively worked to remove such content.  \nIt said action was taken against violators of the policy - like disabling accounts. It also said it supported police investigations and had a team working around the clock to respond to authorities' data requests.\nSimilarly, TikTok said the trade of dangerous weapons was prohibited and that in the third quarter of 2024, 96% of clips that breached guidelines were removed before being reported. It said sharp knives, regardless of size, were not allowed to be sold on TikTok Shop.\nIt added it worked closely with government and police to understand changes in knife crime, and assisted police enquiries.  \nI reached out to Meta too - which hasn't yet provided a comment. Previously a spokeswoman told the Times that the promotion and sale of weapons on Meta's platforms was banned, and that such content was removed when found.\nShe added that in 2024, Meta met other tech firms, the Home Office, Ofcom and officials to understand how to work together to tackle the issue.\nTelegram - the most unregulated of all the platforms - didn't get back to me.\nTelegram is crucial as it is the place where sales of the dangerous weapons actually take place - without action by them, things might not change even if Snapchat, TikTok and Meta cracked down on harmful content.\nMurdered teen Ronan Kanda's sister told the BBC that his murderer \"didn't have any problems collecting his knife from his local post office\".\nHis mother, Pooja, was adamant that the online sale of bladed articles had played a \"crucial role\" in the tragedy. \"A 16-year-old managed to get these weapons online and sold these weapons to other people,\" she said.\nFollowing his death the government has announced a series of new measures known as Ronan's Law, including stiffer sentences for selling knives to under-18s.\n\"Out of tragedy comes a light,\" said Pooja. \"The light we all need.\"\nBut she stressed \"there's so much more we can do.\"\nRight now, it's still incredibly easy to buy lethal blades on social media.",

        "article_text": "Many of the stars of Toxic Town had not heard of the scandal the drama is based on, but are hoping the Netflix retelling will bring it into the spotlight.\nThe show follows the real-life battle of families in Corby, Northamptonshire, whose children were born with defects in the 1980s and 90s.\nIn court it was argued that toxic airborne pollutants from the town's demolished steelworks had harmed unborn babies.\nActor Brendan Coyle, who was born in Corby, admitted he had been unaware of the story, but said there was excitement in his hometown to see it told to the world.\n\"One of the mothers has been in touch... It's kind of the talk of the town. People are excited about it,\" he said.\n\"For them, the mothers and these children, to have their story told... it's amazing. It's something that's been buried for a long time in terms of people's perception.\"\nIn the drama, the Downton Abbey star plays Roy Thomas, a fictional Corby borough councillor.\nThe 62-year-old actor explained that, like many in the town, his family had moved from Scotland to work at the Corby Steelworks, which in 1979, just before its closure, had about 10,000 employees.\n\"When I was born in Corby, 80% of the population of that town had been born in Scotland,\" he said.\n\"My granny and granddad came down from Bellshill, which is a mining community outside Glasgow. They never lost their accent because you're in amongst it, you know?\"\n\nMembers of his family, including his brother, still live and work in the area.\n\"My brother asked 'Is there any craic in this?'\" he laughed.\n\"On the surface it's very bleak... but in the documentary [the Horizon programme on the case] you see the women they talk to and there's great spirit and humour and great craic.\n\"I think Jack [Thorne, writer of the drama] has captured that brilliantly.\"\nFor executive producer Annabel Jones, humour was an important part of the storytelling.\nShe said: \"Corby is known for its sense of humour; known for its warmth. I wanted to make sure that comes across through the characters as well, because I want it to feel true to Corby.\n\"I didn't want it to feel that people didn't have a sense of hope at that time.\"\nThe Emmy and Bafta-winning Welsh producer first heard about the scandal while in lockdown during the pandemic.\nA friend, from Corby, told her about the case while they were on a masked-up walk in a park.\nShe recalled: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked that, firstly, I have never heard of this story, and secondly, why have I never heard of this story?\n\"This really needs to be pulled into the public consciousness; we need to be made aware so things like this don't happen again.\"\nFrom that point, the 53-year-old began speaking to as many people involved in the case as possible to ensure their stories were told story accurately.\nOne of the nuances of the adaptation is the Corby accent, which Coyle compared to a \"diluted\" Scottish accent.\nHe said: \"It's an odd one but I can recognise it anywhere. I've been on a tube before and been like 'Are you from Corby?' There is nothing like it.\"\nThe executive producer added: \"It's such a particular accent because obviously Corby has lots of different influences... We did work with lots of accent coaches to try and perfect it.\n\"Jodie Whittaker really worked hard. It was probably the thing she was most nervous about. When she met with Susan she very kindly reassured her and told her she'd done a good job.\"\nOther members of the cast met or emailed the people they played to help craft their performance.\nHowever, this was not an option for Robert Carlyle. The man he portrayed, Corby borough councillor Sam Hagen, died in October 2022, a year before filming began.\nTo help, the production team sourced hours of video footage in which the real-life politician told his story.\nCarlyle, who starred in The Full Monty, said: \"He's got a straight kind of voice; a slightly higher kind of Glasgow man that talks like that... I thought... 'That just sounds like my dad.'\n\"I thought 'There's elements here of my dad in Sam' and that was my way in.\"\nThe Trainspotting actor described his character as \"a hero with a small h\" who \"fundamentally wants Corby to succeed\".\nCarlyle said: \"He was determined to make the best of his life down there to try and regenerate this town. He's the kind of man who made sure the traffic lights are working correctly and there's a zebra crossing in the right place.\n\"He does the right thing. It's lovely; a lot of my characters aren't like that. It's nice to have a chance to play somebody who is inherently good.\"\nCastmate Rory Kinnear, who played solicitor Des Collins, explained the show never made a judgement on any of the characters, one way or the other \n\"Everyone believes they're doing the right thing,\" he said.\n\"It allows an audience to decide whether they think those people did do the right things at the right time for the right reason.\"\nKinnear did not speak to the real-life lawyer while preparing for the role.\nHe said: \"The choice of casting me means they were taking it in a slightly different way. I knew they were creating a version of Des in terms of age; in terms of look; in terms of lots of other things\"\nThe real Des Collins, however, thought the Bond actor's portrayal was very close to the truth: \"He got me down to a tee. He was more me than I am,\" he said.\n\"I ended up on a couple of occasions, having seen it, saying 'Oh, I wish said that' and then I realised it wasn't me doing it, it was Rory Kinnear pretending to be me.\"\nThe actor hopes the drama will get people talking. \"As the sibling of a disabled person myself, one is well aware that they are not at the forefront of public interest,\" he said.\n\"What excites me about this is, not just the story itself, but the fact Netflix are doing it and it's a departure for them to do a four-part series like this of this subject matter.\n\"You could well imagine this being on late on BBC2 or Channel 4, and 250,000 loved it and watched it, but it doesn't have any impact.\n\"I think Netflix's ambition with it is to make sure it's something everybody watches, talks about and is made aware of.\"\nBBC Radio Northampton has produced an eight-part documentary series called In Detail: The Toxic Waste Scandal, which will be available for download on 4 March.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation \u2013 with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "When most of us are stressed out we're able to intuitively name the emotion because of the way it makes us feel.\nBut when Dr Krysia Waldock is struggling it can take a bit longer for the penny to drop.\nThat's because they are one of up to 10% of the population that experiences alexithymia.\nThe word alexithymia derives from Greek and translates roughly as \"no words for emotions\".\nPeople who experience the phenomenon, which is not widely known about, can have difficulties expressing their emotions, recognising their emotions and telling the difference between different emotions.\n\"For me, a lot of the time it's struggling to know how I feel,\" said Dr Waldock.\n\"So something will happen, I'll know that there is a feeling, but I don't know what it is and it'll take me a while, if at all, to figure out what I'm feeling.\"\nIdentifying stress can be particularly challenging. \n\"Sometimes when I'm stressed or anxious, for example, I feel it in my body, feel it in my jaw a lot, I'll bump into things, drop things... I'll know something's out but I won't necessarily put two and two together,\" they said.\n\"So it will either take a very long time for me to put it together or it just will not be put together at all.\"\nDr Waldock, who uses they/them pronouns, is autistic. Research suggests autistic people are up to five times more likely to experience alexithymia compared to the general population. \n\"For me, it's part of being autistic and neurodivergent,\" they said. \nAlexithymia is closely related to interoception, which is the ability to interpret and label internal signals from your body such as when you are hungry, tired or need to go to the toilet. \nDr Waldock said on occasion they do not experience hunger cues so eat at set times to ensure they do not miss meals. \nDr Waldock is a research assistant at Swansea University and is currently working on a project that aims to better understand autistic people's reproductive health experiences throughout their life.\nTheir colleague, the project's research officer Dr Rebecca Ellis, also has autism and alexithymia.\nDr Ellis said the experience of alexithymia differed from person to person and was also more common among people with anxiety and depression.\nSome people have always had alexithymia whereas others acquire it through trauma, she said. \nShe said she struggled to tell the difference between feeling anxious and excited.\n\"Both of them can feel quite similar and quite uncomfortable as well,\" she said. \n\"If I went on a rollercoaster I'm just sat there worried so why would I go on it?\"\nShe also finds it hard to tell if she is apprehensive or looking forward to something. \n\"That's a big ball of confusion for me,\" she laughed. \n\"So even if it's a lovely social event that I'm looking forward to... I'm always kind of feeling a little bit positive and maybe a little bit negative about it.\"\nBoth Dr Ellis and Dr Waldock have found ways of working with their alexithymia.\nDr Ellis said asking others questions about how they are able to identity their emotions could be useful.\n\"It can be something that you can learn to get better at,\" she said. \n\"You can get an understanding of your emotions and feelings.\"\nDr Waldock uses an app called How We Feel which lists different feelings and definitions which they can use to help identify how they are feeling. \nBoth agreed being given a non-judgmental heads up from those close to them when they were acting differently could be useful.  \nThere are no set diagnostic criteria for alexithymia so why is having a term like this useful? \n\"I think it allows you to be kinder to yourself,\" said Dr Ellis.\n\"Having that term not only means that more people than just yourself are experiencing it, but it also means that you and others can understand it a bit better too.\"\nDr Waldock agreed.\n\"As I've started learning about what it means to be autistic, and that includes experiences like alexithymia, it's really helped me get to know myself a bit better,\" they said.\n\"Growing up I was the square peg in the round hole scenario consistently whereas now I've stopped trying to push myself into that wrong hole as much.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I accept what I did was awful' - 'Steve'\nWarning: this article contains offensive language\nSteve was leaving the football ground when he shouted back at some away fans. Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'It's all boiling over' - Cunha sees red for violent conduct\nAn FA Cup fifth-round defeat by Bournemouth was a disappointing blow for Wolves, but the impact of losing star forward Matheus Cunha for at least three Premier League matches may hurt even more.\nThe 25-year-old had to be dragged down the tunnel and was unable to take part in the penalty shootout following his red card in the final minute of extra time for an unsavoury clash with Cherries defender Milos Kerkez. \nWolves boss Vitor Pereira said: \"Of course, the emotional side was very high and not only inside the pitch, but on the bench and in the stands, a lot of pressure everywhere. In the end it happens.\n\"It should not happen, but this is something that happens in football.\"\nBoth Matt Doherty and Boubacar Traore missed spot-kicks for Wolves in the 5-4 shootout defeat after a 1-1 draw over 120 minutes at Vitality Stadium.\nIt was a dramatic climax to a game where Evanilson had put the Cherries ahead on his return from injury, before his fellow Brazilian Cunha levelled with a sensational equaliser from around 30 yards.\nHowever, Cunha's display went from magical to madness with a dismissal that will leave his side - fourth bottom in the Premier League - without their best player for crucial games in their relegation fight.\nThe red-mist moment, where he clashed multiple times with Kerkez, including fighting, kicking out at the Hungarian full-back while he was on the ground and aiming a headbutt when Kerkez had got back to his feet.\nAfter being pulled away by team-mates, referee Sam Barrott eventually gave him a red card but a furious Cunha refused to leave the field, needing to be escorted and pushed down the tunnel. \nHe will be suspended for three games following the red card for violent conduct, but additional games cannot be ruled out because of the severity of the incident and having already served a two-match ban for clashing with Ipswich Town security in December.\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on Match of the Day: \"The ability he has is top level, the goal he scored belongs in the Champions League, but then suddenly we see the ugly.\n\"I have not seen that on the football pitch since the 1970s - he just lost it. The referee had to send him off. They couldn't get him out of the ground. This was the ugly part and it is something he has to stop.\n\"Wolves need points to stay up. He will be a huge loss.\"\nCunha sent off as Bournemouth beat Wolves on penalties\nWhy did Bournemouth VAR check take eight minutes?\nWolves have what could be described as a favourable run of fixtures coming up against teams in the bottom half of the Premier League. \nBut Cunha is certain to miss matches against Everton, bottom club Southampton and West Ham, while third-bottom Ipswich follow on 5 April.\nWolves have built a five-point buffer over Ipswich and Leicester City after winning two of their past four league matches.\nBut losing talisman Cunha will be a massive blow, given he is their top league scorer on 13 goals and their attacking inspiration in this troubled campaign.\nCunha was sent off in the 120th minute of the match in the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Vitality Stadium\nCunha has been linked with a big-money move over the past year with Europe's top clubs keen, but he may be viewed as a loose cannon because of his antics.\nAs well as his aggressive display at Bournemouth, in an unsavoury incident at Ipswich earlier in the season, Cunha elbowed a member of the Portman Road staff before snatching his glasses off his face.\nThe Brazil forward is known to have a \u00a362.5m release clause in place which may also put off suitors looking to secure a summer transfer.\nWolves boss Pereira told BBC Match of the Day: \"When the situation happened I was looking for the ball.\n\"It means that I didn't see the situation, but football is emotional and the level was very high today. Not only inside the pitch, but outside [the pitch]. With a lot of pressure, and in the end these are things that can happen.\n\"You know now he is frustrated, he is better in my opinion. I never speak to the team when we are nervous or frustrated. It is better to wait one day and think about everything. After we can have a talk.\n\"Of course, he is an important player, but next game we play with 11 and start with 11.\"\nSpeaking in his post-match news conference, he added: \"Matheus is a special player and today he played extra time. The last three weeks he has a problem in the hamstring and he tried.\n\"I didn't see the situation. Don't ask me about it because I was looking at the other end. In the end the referee decided the red card.\"\nAsked about whether Cunha deserves another chance, Pereira added: \"Of course, he is important but I cannot speak about what I don't know. It is important to check the situation, to look for what happened because I was looking for the other side.\n\"The others say to me he kick, he punch, he do what he did with the head and the player went to hospital? No, OK. But it is a situation that cannot happen of course.\n\"To judge the situation, I must have the clear image in my mind.\"\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola criticised the decision to show Kerkez a yellow card in the Cunha clash. It was was the defender's second in this season's FA Cup and means he will be banned from playing in the quarter-final tie.\n\"Milos Kerkez has received a yellow card for adopting an aggressive attitude,\" said Iraola. \"After what they have done to Milos Kerkez, they should reward him because [of] the attitude he has.\n\"They punch him, they kick him on the floor, they headbutt him and he doesn't react! You punish this? I will have to say to Milos [that] probably I cannot do as well as a player.\n\"The prize is they show him a yellow card and he will not play the quarter-final.

        "article_text": "Amanda Pritchard, head of NHS England, would have regular Monday meetings with Health Secretary Wes Streeting to review performance and address challenges. But last Monday was different. After discussing the state of the health service, she announced she was stepping down - with just one month's notice.\nIt came as a shock to many in the organisation, under which there are 1.4 million staff who deal with 1.7 million patients everyday. But those in the know had suspected something was happening - though not the timing.\nThat meeting between Pritchard and Streeting was the natural conclusion of changes which had been rumbling on in the corridors of power for some time.\nNHS England was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2013. The aim was to free the organisation from interference by politicians.\nUnder Sir Simon Stevens - now Lord Stevens - NHS England developed into what looked like a rival power base and led by an alternative health secretary. He was at the heart of work drawing up long-term NHS plans under David Cameron and Theresa May. Lord Stevens knew his way around Whitehall and knew how to win backroom battles with ministers.\nAmanda Pritchard had been deputy to Lord Stevens since 2019 and played a vital role in the NHS response to the pandemic, including the vaccine roll-out. It had seemed inevitable she would take over the top job in 2021. Understandably, she expected to continue in the same vein as her predecessor. But with the arrival of a Labour government last year that certainty began to weaken.\nThe first clue that things would be going back to a more traditional management regime, with more direct government control, came when two health experts were appointed from previous Labour governments: Alan Milburn, Blair's health secretary, and Paul Corrigan, an adviser. It became clear that they would be involved in shaping policy with Wes Streeting.\nOne well-placed health source said those two \"remembered the old days\", before the NHS's shift to autonomy, which they felt made the system \"too bureaucratic\".\nAnother clue came when work began on a new NHS 10-year plan for England. With previous plans Lord Stevens had \"held the pen\", but this time the government brought in Sally Warren from the King's Fund think tank - outside NHS England management - to head up the the work.\nAt the same time, noises were being made about slimming down NHS England management - and instead devolving money to local health boards and patient services. Government sources deny that NHS England is being subsumed into the health department but say it will have a \"leaner\" role, cutting out duplication.\nAmanda Pritchard was well aware of the direction of travel. She could see that her job was going to change and had considered stepping down later this year. There has been no suggestion of any row or confrontation with Wes Streeting.\nNHS officials say that the decision to leave at the end of March was because it will be the end of a financial year - and there was no need to stay for the launch of the 10-year plan in the early summer.\nIn January Ms Pritchard had a bruising experience at the hands of two parliamentary select committees. One suggested she and colleagues were \"complacent\" and another said they were disappointed with \"lengthy and diffuse answers\". In a BBC interview she admitted that \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings\" but it was right to be scrutinised. Privately, according to sources, she found the process \"frustrating given how much time she had given to the role\" under some of the most difficult years in the history of the NHS.\nShe will be replaced by Sir Jim Mackey, an experienced NHS trust boss, who is being titled the \"transition\" chief executive. Policy will be run by Wes Streeting's department with Sir Jim, we are told, focusing on delivery including cutting the hospital waiting list of nearly 7.5 million. He had recently helped draft a recovery plan for planned treatment and appointments.\nSo where does all this leave the NHS?\nOn one hand, Amanda Pritchard has provided consistent leadership in various roles under six different health secretaries. The autonomy of NHS England enabled its chief executive to bang the drum for the health service and pressure the government.\nBut on the other hand, serious problems remain with patient outcomes and those closer to Streeting argue more direct government control means less bureaucracy, and the ability to free up resources to deploy where needed.\nOne health source argued that the upcoming changes would end confusion over policy and strategy and encourage collaboration between ministers and NHS England - without being a formal takeover. But another suggested it was \"a bit of a mess\" and there could now be instability and distractions for NHS administrators when they need to focus on wider health challenges.\nMuch will depend on how much money is allocated in the Treasury spending review.\nIt's patients that matter - and it's not yet clear whether or not these changes will help them.",

The autonomy of NHS England enabled its chief executive to bang the drum for the health service and pressure the government.But on the other hand, serious problems remain with patient outcomes and those closer to Streeting argue more direct government control means less bureaucracy, and the ability to free up resources to deploy where needed.One health source argued that the upcoming changes would end confusion over policy and strategy and encourage collaboration between ministers and NHS England - without being a formal takeover.",

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nTurquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nTurquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\n'I accept what I did was awful' - 'Steve'\nWarning: this article contains offensive language\nSteve was leaving the football ground when he shouted back at some away fans. Moments later he was in handcuffs and under arrest.\nHe had shouted a homophobic slur, committing a hate crime that led to him being charged with a Section 5 Public Order offence. The case ended up in court, where he pleaded guilty, and he was banned from attending football matches in the UK for three years.\nNow Steve - not his real name as he fears for the impact on his professional and personal life - is trying to make amends after coming through a fan education programme run by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.\nHere he shares his story with BBC Sport.\nA lifelong football fan, Steve had just watched his side play Chelsea and was leaving the stadium.\n\"I heard Chelsea fans shouting and I shouted back, 'Oi, you Chelsea rent boys', gave them a few gestures and thought nothing of it.  I thought I was just having a bit of back and forth with the away fans,\" he said.\nWhat followed is all a bit of a blur.\n\"I walked away and then all of a sudden I was surrounded by six security guards. And then from that point, a police officer arrested me and put the cuffs on.\"\nSince January 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service has defined the \"Chelsea rent boy\" chant - aimed at the west London club's players and supporters - as a homophobic slur and says that anyone singing it is committing a hate crime and could face prosecution.\n\"I'm in my 20s and I didn't really understand that [term],\" Steve said. \"I knew there was stuff around it, but I didn't really perceive why it was homophobic.\"\nSteve was eventually referred to Kick It Out, which runs a fan education programme where offenders learn about the different types of discrimination and the impact their actions can have on victims.\n\"I accept that [what I did] was awful, and now it's about repaying that, turning that into something positive. I've had a look at myself... I'm willing to make amends,\" he said.\n\"People are going to make mistakes, but you're judged on how you then move forward.\"\nHe said the session had changed him \"massively\".\n\"It's made me aware of how there's a fine line between what's considered banter and just abuse.\"\nThe Kick It Out course is run by Alan Bush, the charity's fan education and engagement manager, who has delivered more than 400 sessions in the past five years. In that time, 40 fans were referred to him by either police or clubs for using the Chelsea slur.\n\"We can't ban our way out of discrimination and we can't just ban football fans from football. All we do is we push it back into society,\" Bush said.\n\"Football has a responsibility to educate its fans... then fans say to other fans  'you can't say that, mate,  you'll end up in court' or 'you can't say that because that's wrong'. There's a chance they report, there's a chance that they challenge. And I just think that has to be a far better than just banning people.\"\nHe added that \"the vast majority have not understood the gravity of how offensive that [chant] can be, how that can cause harassment, alarm and distress to an individual\".\nTo illustrate his point, Bush tells the offenders the story of Lee Johnson, a passionate Tottenham fan who was forced out of football for nearly a decade after hearing the Chelsea chant inside White Hart Lane as a teenager.\n\"It completely shook me to my core,\" Johnson - who is now co-chair of the Proud Lilywhites, the LGBTQ+ supporters' association of Tottenham Hotspur - told BBC Sport. \n\"It felt like all of the lights had gone out and I was just isolated by myself. It just took me straight back to when I was younger at school. 'Rent boy' was one of the things I used to get [called].\"\nJohnson had often been a target for abuse in his home town. Football used to be an escape, somewhere he could \"get lost in the magic of the game\" but hearing homophobic chanting made him question everything.\n\"I was thinking 'Am I safe here?' If people around me knew that I was gay, would they be attacking me or be verbally abusive? Would they stop singing it about Chelsea and would they start singing it about me?\" he said.\n\"People were using a term that has caused a lot of harm to me over the years. It's very traumatic. I think it was still the first half and I just said to my friend, 'I can't be here'. It was a fight or flight response. I left and I didn't come back for nearly 10 years.\"\nSince 2023, the Football Association has also been able to charge clubs if their fans sing the chant.\nSeven charges have been brought against six clubs for homophobic chanting, according to English football's governing body. The clubs, which include Wolves, Leeds and Luton have been fined a total of \u00a3415,000.\nTwo charges raised against Tottenham Hotspur following their Premier League match with Manchester United on 29 September 2024 are yet to be decided.\nThe updated FA guidance, combined with the change in law, appears to be having the desired effect.\nFigures from Kick it Out show reports of mass homophobic chanting are falling, with 17 reported incidents last season, down from 43 in the 2021-22 season.\nSteve knows he has been part of the problem.\nHe has never considered himself homophobic but since he got arrested he has been through a spectrum of emotions.\n\"Fear. Annoyance. Despair. Guilt. But then came acceptance,\" he said.\n\"My journey has sort of been about personal growth. Now I want to make a difference going forward. I want to make football a better place.\"\nHe wants to make sure other do not repeat his mistakes, adding: \"Treat everybody with respect or you'll end up like me with a ban and a criminal record.\n\"Some people who are gay have walked away from football altogether and don't feel it's safe. So, if I can just stop one person from doing that. I'll be happy. Just think before you speak.\"",

This can seriously harm the baby, causing severe anaemia, heart failure, or even death.\nBefore anti-D interventions were developed in the mid-1960s, one in two babies diagnosed with HDFN died. \nIt is unclear how Harrison's blood came to be so rich in anti-D, but some reports said it had to do with the massive blood transfusion he received at 14.\nThere are fewer than 200 anti-D donors in Australia, but they help an estimated 45,000 mothers and their babies every year, according to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, also known as Lifeblood.\nLifeblood has been working with Australia's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research to grow anti-D antibodies in the lab by replicating blood and immune cells from Harrison and other donors. \nResearchers involved hope lab-made anti-D can one day be used to help pregnant women worldwide.\n\"Creating a new therapy has long been a 'holy grail',\" Lifeblood's research director David Irving said.\nHe noted the scarcity of donors committed to regular donation, who are able to produce antibodies in sufficient quality and quantity.",

        "article_text": "The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away.\nThe impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. \nEach season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year.\nRemote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. \n \"I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,\" she says.\n\"That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience.\"\nBut one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened.\nAs a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region.\n\"We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,\" she says.\nOn any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. \nNow, those jobs are gone.\nShe worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. \nMass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff \u2013 around 1,000 workers - being forced out.\nThe cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired.\nThe cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year.\nLong queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well.\nA popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is \"due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees\" and \"will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels\".\nAt Yosemite National Park, the annual \"firefall\" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff.\nAndria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she \"100%\" supports the protest.\n\"It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,\" she says.\nShe says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect.\nMs Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species.\n\"They both are in dire straits,\" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild.\nStaff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut.\n\"I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,\" she says.\n\"The future of conservation just feels very uncertain.\"\nLong-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains.\nThe email firing them and thousands of other staff cited \"performance\" issues \u2013 something they took issue with.\n\"Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,\" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic.\nHe and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses \u2013 and never being paid more than $22 (\u00a317.40) an hour.\n\"It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,\" Ms Thompson added. \nFollowing a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months.\n\"On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,\" Burgum told Fox News last Friday.\n\"But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit.\"\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget.\nOutdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect.\n\"If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,\" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC.\nSome of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail.\nMeanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA.\nConcerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season.\nWildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are \"completely crucial\" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for \"sweeping\" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires.\n\"I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,\" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps.\n\"Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.\"",

        "article_text": "Manchester United have only lost one of their past 21 games against FA Cup opponents Fulham\nManchester United manager Ruben Amorim is convinced the club are on a clear path to a better future, on and off the pitch.\nIt has been another testing week at Old Trafford. After escaping with a draw despite a woeful first 70 minutes at Everton last Saturday, 48 hours later chief executive Omar Berrada was telling staff up to 200 jobs could go in a second round of redundancies.\nIt took a backs-to-the-wall second-half display against relegation-threatened Ipswich on Wednesday to claim a vital Premier League win after more defensive mistakes and Patrick Dorgu's red card threatened a sixth home defeat of Amorim's short reign.\nThe Portuguese says life is \"hard\" just now - but remains convinced better times lie ahead.\n\"I see a clear path, and I see that from the board also,\" he said in the build-up to Sunday's home FA Cup fifth-round tie against Fulham. \"They are also doing difficult changes.\n\"They are not popular but they are doing it because they have a vision. In the future we need to show some results. You can do a lot of changes but if you don't have results, people don't feel confident and happy.\n\"The good thing is we have a clear path. Now [it] is hard but we are doing things to achieve success in the future.\"\nUnited's inconsistency puts even more focus on the two cup competitions they remain in - they face Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie on Thursday - as it appears increasingly likely winning one of them is the only way they will qualify for European football next season.\nThe issues he is facing are so extensive, Amorim could be forgiven for wishing he had stuck to his initial demand not to leave Sporting until the end of the season.\nHowever, he does think dealing with so many problems has made him a more rounded coach.\n\"Better [coach] is hard to say, because I am not winning games,\" he said. \"But in three months here, I live certain things that I think make me a more complete manager.\n\"Sometimes you need to lose and be in a poor situation to grow. I am not going to die if I lose three games in a row. I learned that here. I can cope and maintain my energy.

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nTurquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nTurquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

The quake struck shortly after 22:00 local time as celebrities were gathering at the popular Vanity Fair afterparty. \nThose in the area reported a sudden jolt of energy, with some screaming and seeing high-rise buildings wobbling like jelly. \nThe US Geological Survey (USGS), which tracks such events, said the earthquake was felt miles across Los Angeles. \nThere was no tsunami alert issued as a result of the relatively minor earthquake.\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department said that the earthquake was felt across downtown Los Angeles but the agency was not entering into \"Earthquake Mode\" over the incident. \nFor stronger earthquakes, first responders and officials do assessments of the area to ensure there is no structural damage to buildings and infrastructure. \nThe quake is among about 40 that have hit Southern California since the start of March - though nearly all of these were magnitude 1 earthquakes that aren't typically felt by residents, according to USGS data reviewed by the BBC. \nLast month, there was a magnitude 3.7 earthquake that struck the nearby Malibu area. In December, a strong magnitude 7 earthquake jolted northern California and caused a short tsunami alert for those in northern California and southern Oregon. \nBBC correspondents covering the Academy Awards in the heart of Hollywood reported fierce shaking and even some screams as the sudden jolt scared visitors. To some, it sounded like a bomb went off with the rumble. \nOne resident called it the biggest earthquake she'd felt and was surprised it was only a magnitude 3.9. \"I felt that in my bones,\" she remarked. \nThe BBC's Emma Vardy said she was retouching her makeup for some final Oscars filming when the quake struck. Her diamond earrings wobbled in the mirror and she realized the high-rise she was in was shaking.  \n\"I have felt a lot of quakes over the past two years in Los Angeles but currently, I am on the 15th floor of our media centre in Hollywood,\" she remarked. \"Feeling a building of that size move around like jelly is quite an experience.\" \nSam Granville and Emma Vardy contributed to this report.",

        "article_text": "Meghan's new Netflix series in which she offers cooking and home tips arrives next week. She's just the latest high-profile woman to present herself as a lifestyle guru \u2013 and divide opinion in doing so.\nThe Duchess of Sussex's lifestyle show is finally arriving on Netflix on Tuesday, after being pushed back because of the Los Angeles fires. With Love, Meghan sees her picking flowers, cooking with friends, and looking radiant in a huge, glossy Californian home.\nThe move into such well-worn domestic-goddess territory saw Meghan instantly dubbed \"the millennial Martha Stewart of Montecito\" in The New York Times. But of course, this being Meghan \u2013 the subject of a vast amount of criticism in the British media specifically and on social media generally \u2013 backlash flared the minute the trailer was released. She's flaunting her wealth, said her critics: tone-deaf. She's becoming a trad wife: bad feminist. She's fake, she just wants to sell products, she's unbearably earnest\u2026\u00a0\nAnd yet, Meghan has her fans as much as her detractors, and it's likely that With Love, Meghan will be a ratings hit for the streamer, bringing people together: not always in the way the show intends perhaps, but by persuading both those who buy into the pretty-princess fantasy \u2013 and those who may \"hate-watch\" it \u2013 to tune in, agog. \"Everyone's invited to create wonder in every moment\" \u2013 as Meghan puts it.\nThe public's feelings towards domestic goddesses \u2013 those women who sell a lifestyle, and a very particular idealised version of womanhood \u2013 have always been complex, but they may have never been more conflicted than in 2025. \"Of course, the image of the idealised woman has changed over time, and even more rapidly in recent years\" says Dr Edith Hill, an Australian academic whose research is in social media, influencers and women's bodies online. These days, Hill tells the BBC, \"there is no one ''ideal' image of a woman online, as each community and sub-community has their own version of the perfect creator.\" This means that the most famous end up both loved and loathed: figures like Meghan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nara Smith walk the line between having devoted fanbases, and being scorned, castigated and even blamed for a wealth of societal ills.\nNara Smith is probably the most famous iteration of the most vexed contemporary version of the domestic goddess: the trad wife. Smith has 11.5 million followers on TikTok \u2013 that's a lot of people who want to watch videos from her home in Texas, where she raises kids and bakes their food from scratch. While wearing ballgowns. In a gorgeous kitchen. You could say it's aggressively aspirational \u2013 but it's also patently unrealistic. I doubt many people watching genuinely wish they too could make their toddlers homemade bubblegum while wearing a lime-green conical-bust gown. \u00a0\nMore like this:\n\u2022 How one surprising image kick-started the 1990s\n\u2022 Ten of the best TV shows to watch this March\n\u2022 Why influencers are facing a pushback\nOf course, many women do find joy and satisfaction in the kitchen \u2013 or in other traditional domestic activities, such as hosting, home-making, arranging flowers, dressing in a feminine way\u2026 there's nothing inherently \"unfeminist\" with any of that. But the broader interest in trad wives \u2013 women who espouse traditional 1950s-style family values, and dedicate themselves wholly to keeping house and raising kids \u2013 has been seen by many as a worryingly retrograde step. Less domestic goddess, more domestic servitude, is the gist of the criticism. \"There is a certain undertone from some of the more traditional creators that does lean toward very stereotypical gender roles and strong religious ideals, that can lead to the oppression of women,\" says Hill. \"It would be naive to ignore the very close line that can be drawn between that content and women's oppression.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe recent obsession with trad wives may reflect a broader disenchantment with modern lifestyles: the anxiety that what equality of the sexes actually brought us is merely drudgery for all. When two parents have to work constantly in order to have enough money to live, and women also end updoing a \"second shift\" of housework and childcare, the old model of dividing the labour might look more appealing.\nArguably, we could more accurately place the source of the problem with capitalism, rather than feminism \"gone too far\". And it is unfortunately inevitable that full-time tradwiffery requires a partner who earns a lot of money, inevitably also bringing that traditional dynamic into play: domestic bliss predicated on man-as-breadwinner, woman-as-helpmeet.\nBut as much as there is endless hand-wringing in the media over the meaning of the trad-wife phenomenon, in some ways, it's nothing new: domestic goddesses have always been a source of fascination \u2013 dismissed as retrograde by some, and yet a source of aspiration, inspiration, and even compulsion for others. Because they don't just present a certain lifestyle: they often promise that you, scruffy disorganised frazzled ordinary woman, could be a domestic goddess too, if you just do what they say. Witness: the OG DG, Martha Stewart, who made a multi-million-dollar empire out of housekeeping tips.\nStewart made her name as a hard-grafting lifestyle guru who would tell you exactly what to do, and how to do it properly, whether putting up a shelf or planning a wedding. And part of the appeal of domestic goddesses has always been this illusion of control, of solution: do this, and have a better life.\nStewart started out running a catering business in 1975, before publishing the legendary 1982 glossy how-to guide, Entertaining. It was just the starting gun of the unstoppable Martha Stewart brand, that's since flogged everything from tea towels to CBD gummies; she's published more than 100 books offering brisk guidance on gardening, hosting, cooking and homemaking. And the news that Entertaining is to be republished this year surely supports the theory that we're in a retro domestic goddess moment.\nFollowing in Martha's footsteps came another US DG who inspires a devoted following: Ina Garten aka The Barefoot Contessa. Garten just published a memoir, Be Ready When the Luck Happens, designed to persuade people that her seemingly charmed career \u2013 from running a Hamptons food store so casually chic that it featured in a Nancy Meyers movie, to fronting scores of cookery books and TV shows since the 90s \u2013 was the result of hard work and good timing, a blend of effort and effortlessness.\nGarten's recipes also straddle effort and effortlessness: she specialises in rich, indulgent, bistro-style deliciousness, and offers detailed instruction as to exactly how to achieve it. But she's won fans for her catchphrase \"store-bought is fine\": a pinch of realism amid the lifestyle gloss.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd of course, not all domestic goddesses have been about perfection or spending hours in the kitchen \u2013 in fact, many have made a career out of proffering tips and tricks to make hosting and homemaking easier. Shirley Conran, the British journalist and author \u2013 also sometimes called the \"original\" domestic goddess \u2013\u00a0 promoted the idea of women \"having it all\", and famously informed women in her 1975 pop-feminism housework manual Superwoman that \"life is too short to stuff a mushroom\". Nara Smith clearly didn't get the memo.\nThe idea of Superwoman was to liberate women from the tyranny of housework and perfection, not to be trapped by it: a domestic goddess in the 70s was the woman who had it all \u2013 job, home, marriage, kids, good sex, control of their finances, and a general air of fabulousness. The title was not actually meant to be taken seriously: \"A Superwoman isn\u2019t a woman who can do anything, but a woman who avoids doing too much,\" Conran wrote.\nAnd missing the irony has often been an issue for DGs \u2013 not least for the deliciously tongue-in-cheek Nigella Lawson, who helped popularise the term. The curvaceous, flirtatious British chef also began her career with a book full of time-saving tips and anti-perfectionist reassurance: \"Never worry about what your guests will think of you,\" she wrote encouragingly in How to Eat. \"Just think of the food. What will taste good?\"\nBut her second book in 1998 was called How to Be a Domestic Goddess \u2013 a joke that was missed, she's long insisted, and a title that now makes her cringe. \"It was supposed to be ironic,\" she told the New York Times in 2019. Today, Lawson is a full-on national treasure in the UK, but at the start of her fame, and rather like today's trad wives, she was castigated by some critics who accused her of setting back feminism. She has since countered her critics by describing baking as feminist.\nA domestic goddess became a standard to live up to, and yet another reason for women to feel inadequate. And this is the contradiction at the heart of DGs, whether they\u2019re incredibly earnest (Meghan; Gwyneth) or winkingly ironic (Lawson): while many give off an air of effortlessness and espouse mantras of ease for most women most of the time, such domestic bliss is actually not easy. Or, indeed, affordable. \"We're not in the pursuit of perfection, we're in the pursuit of joy,\" declares Meghan in the trailer for her show.\u00a0 But it's hard not to feel like it would be a lot easier to pursue joy if you lived in a Californian mansion with help. To state the obvious, an enviable, idealised lifestyle is more readily available when you don't have to stress about the bills, and instead have the free time to, say, learn to fold a napkin like an Easter bunny.\nIt is also so obvious as to be almost banal to point out that DGs are mostly very wealthy. And fortune begets fortune: all this lifestyle content is, on some level, also an advert for the DGs' product lines, whether that's Meghan's company, As Ever, selling jams, Ina's cookware, or Gwyneth\u2019s Goop empire.\nFor some, the wholesome, homespun emphasis on making preserves or crafting your own table decorations is particularly grating precisely because these women are clearly monied and leisured enough to have time for all that. Yet for others, that's what's appealing, even soothing, about watching them: we may not have a spare four hours to bake, but we can watch a four-minute video of Nara Smith baking; we may not have the money to make like Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway at the opening of the eponymous novel, and buy the flowers ourselves, but we can watch Meghan pick out blooms in a fancy florist.\n\"The domesticity is presented to us as peaceful while also fulfilling,\" says Hill, on the appeal of this sort of content, which it is so easy to be cynical about. \"Many people can relate to wanting to nourish and nurture their families, but what this looks like in reality for everyone else is at complete odds to the image we're presented through these curated narratives.\"\nPerhaps this is the key: we mustn't mistake today's goddesses with mere mortals \u2013 consider them floating fictional constructs, higher(-earning) beings. And absolutely not a yardstick against which to measure ideal femininity. \"I think we can be inspired by these women and the lives they are presenting,\" say Hill, \"while also recognising it is wholly impossible to attain.\"\nWith Love, Meghan is on Netflix from 4 March\nHolly Williams's novel, The Start of Something, is out in paperback now\u00a0\n--\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Jodie Cunningham said it was evidence of the work English women's rugby league still has to do.\nEngland's experience in Las Vegas could hardly have been more chastening. A 90-4 defeat by Australia was the biggest the Lionesses - either as England or Great Britain - have ever suffered.\nBoth captain Cunningham and centre Hardcastle, interviewed on the pitch moments after a shattering result, were quick to pinpoint the reasons for it: they couldn't get enough of the ball, and so ended up spending much of the 70 minutes trying to defend against the best team in the world.\nHow to use that as a learning experience to avoid a repeat is a tougher question - and one that goes to the heart of the structure of women's rugby league in England.\nThe effort from Stuart Barrow's team never wavered, even as hopes of running their opponents close were shredded. The fact they scored the final try of the match, having conceded 17 before that, spoke volumes of their capacity to keep going.\nThat, in itself, required huge reserves of character.\n\"I think we know what we need to do when we go back home,\" Hardcastle said. \"You can't take anything away from the Jillaroos. \n\"They're absolute athletes and what they get to do in Australia, and how professional they are, and the backing that they get is incredible. And to face them at a top level, it's a privilege to be here.\n\"We've lost, but to be able to be here and give it a go and know what it's like in that battle, in that washing machine, it's been worth that 70 minutes.\"\nThe size of the defeat clearly hurt.\n\"There are always positives to take,\" Cunningham said. \"Right now, it's tough to focus on them, but I think the heart was there, the effort was there, we didn't give up. \n\"I think Georgia Roche getting a try for us right at the end shows that we didn't give up. The effort was there. It was just that they were too good for us. \n\"But I'm proud of the girls. I'm proud of how they kept going and sometimes that's what you've got to take at international rugby.\"\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nAustralia score 90 points against England in Las Vegas - as it happened\nJodie Cunningham acknowledged England did not have enough of the ball against Australia\nIn an interview with Sky Sports before the match, Cunningham had highlighted the gulf in investment between the women's domestic game in Australia and England.\nShe had pointed out how the players in the NRL Women's Premiership (NRLW) were either full-time or semi-professional, while those in England's Women's Super League play for expenses or nothing at all.\nThat gulf was on show at the Allegiant Stadium, as a ruthless Australia side kept on punishing their opponents.\nAnd it provided a significant reality check as England start building towards next year's World Cup.\n\"It shows where women's rugby league's at,\" Cunningham said. \"The growth that's happened over recent years, the investment that's gone into the NRLW is there to see, with the athletes they have and what you can see on show today. \n\"We've got a lot of work to do. But we've got a great squad, we've got a great group of staff and we're willing to put that hard work in to get better.\"\nIn a recent interview with BBC Sport, former Great Britain head coach Jackie Sheldon highlighted the investment Australia have put into their women's game over the past two decades as a key factor in their international dominance - they have won the past three World Cups, and lost just once since 2016.\nShe suggested England have to find a way to compete physically with Australia and New Zealand in order to be able to challenge them.\nGiven the disparity in investment between the domestic game in England and Australia, that may not be a quick process. It may be helped, though, by the experience gained by English players who have moved to the NRLW: Roche plays her club rugby for Newcastle Knights, and Hollie-Mae Dodd for Canberra Raiders, while Paige Travis will start the coming season with Parramatta Eels, having switched from St Helens.\nPerhaps, in time, the painful memories of Vegas will make England better too. As Hardcastle put it: \"The result's hard, but there's a lot we can look at individually, and think: what do we need to do to be better?\"",

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation \u2013 with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky met US President Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement that would give the US access to its deposits of rare earth minerals.\nBut after Zelensky left early following a fiery exchange with Trump and Vice-President JD Vance, the White House announced that the deal had not been signed.\nZelensky previously said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no US security guarantees had yet been agreed - something he had been pushing for.\nTrump had said a deal would help US taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war, but said the responsibility of Kyiv's security should fall to Europe.\nOn Wednesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement. It was published on Friday morning.\nThe preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction. \nShmyhal said Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\".\nAccording to the deal, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\".\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nZelensky acknowledged the fund, but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\". \nThe agreement states that the US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law. \nDisagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what appears to be a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped.\n\"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine's sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC. \n\"Now, they've shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\"\nOn Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal. \nBut German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.\nZelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nBut on Wednesday, he said no such guarantee had been made. \n\"I wanted to have a sentence on security guarantees for Ukraine, and it's important that it's there,\" the Ukrainian leader explained. \nAsked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar.\n\"If we don't get security guarantees, we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.\"\nDespite this, the published agreement says the US supports \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".\nHe said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump \"agree on security guarantees\" and decide on how to \"tie this preliminary agreement\" to a US security guarantee.\nTrump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees \"beyond... very much\", adding that responsibility for this would now fall to Europe. \nBut he added that the presence of US workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\".\nThe prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nTrump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\". \nThe US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.\nTrump had said the two would sign the deal at Friday's meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said that only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead saw Trump and Zelensky descend into a heated exchange in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nZelensky said there should be \"no compromises\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced that the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nThe US president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelensky had \"disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\". He added: \"He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"\nIt is now unclear when the deal might be signed, if at all.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is that it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" says Mylovanov. \"In that sense if the US invests, it will benefit everyone.\"\nVladimir Putin has not yet addressed reports that the terms of a deal between the US and Ukraine have been agreed.\nBut on Monday evening he told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since launching a full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.\nCommenting on Zelensky's visit to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday: \"Whether it will be [to sign] the aforementioned agreement or something else, we'll see. There have been no official statements on this matter yet.\"",

        "article_text": "This year's Oscars had it all - glamour, tears and the Wicked stars defying gravity. Here are some of the top moments from the biggest night in Hollywood.\nThere was an audible gasp from journalists in the winners' room when Mikey Madison was announced as the best actress winner. \nDemi Moore was the favourite for much of this campaign. Things did shift after Madison's Bafta win, but the race remained incredibly tight.\nIn the end, it was Madison's night. It marked an incredible moment for a 25-year-old actress who was relatively unknown before her role in Anora.\nThis is exactly the type of rags-to-riches story that awards ceremonies love \u2013 and the film itself celebrates.\nThe film tells the story of sex worker Anora, who has a whirlwind ill-fated romance with the spoilt son of a Russian oligarch.\nEdie Turquet, one of the young female dancers and strippers in the film, texted me to say it was \"insane\" that a film about sex workers could win best picture at the Oscars.\nShe added that she hoped it would \"shift or at least challenge\" perspectives of people towards her community.\nWe all knew it was coming but Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande belting out Wicked's anthem Defying Gravity was even better than we could have hoped for.\nAs Erivo, in a white gown, hit that final iconic note, the audience stood in applause.\nThe co-stars performed a medley of songs, including Somewhere Over the Rainbow, which Grande sang to open the show wearing a gorgeous red sequined dress.\nEarlier in the night, Grande stunned on the red carpet with a champagne Schiaparelli gown, which leaned into her role as Glinda the Good Witch in the film.\n\"It's giving chandelier,\" one reporter said to me backstage.\nOn social media the big question was: \"How is she going to sit down in that dress?\"\nOn the red carpet, there was quite a moment when Halle Berry ran up to Adrien Brody and gave him a big kiss. \nIt recreated a moment at the 2003 Academy Awards, when Brody - having just won best actor for his performance in The Pianist - turned and kissed Berry, who had presented the award to him.\nShe told Variety: \"I had to pay him back\".\nSpeaking to Extra, she added that the only reason she did it was because Brody's girlfriend, Georgina Chapman, \"was fine\" with it.\nThe Oscars wrote on X with a clip of the kiss: \"A reunion 22 years in the making\".\nBerry and Brody weren't the only two seen locking lips.\nInside the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre, lovebirds Kylie Jenner and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet were photographed sharing a kiss and laughing together.\nReality star and makeup mogul Jenner was there to support her boyfriend who was up for best actor - but ended up losing out to... Brody.\nActor Adam Sandler was in on the ongoing jokes about his typically casual attire.\nEarly on in the night, host Conan O'Brien called him out, saying he was \"dressed like a guy playing video poker at 2am\".\n(For reference, Sandler was in the audience wearing a blue hoodie and shorts, an ensemble that looked more at home on the basketball court).\nFollowing a playful back and forth between the two, the actor walked into the aisle of the theatre and said he was \"leaving\" before going over to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and shouting his surname, in the way he previously did on Saturday Night Live.\nChalamet, ever good natured, laughed along.\nThis year's Oscars race has played out against the grim backdrop of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, which killed 29 people. \nThe Grammys and Golden Globes both made the fires a central theme of the show.\nThe Academy Awards mentioned it only a handful of times, signalling Hollywood is moving on.\nThere was, however, one powerful moment, when O'Brien welcomed some of the firefighters who fought the blazes on stage. He called them \"heroes\", with the audience clapping and giving the emergency workers a standing ovation.\nO'Brien then said there are some jokes that even he isn't brave enough to tell - and asked some of the firefighters to read them out instead. \nLA Fire Captain Erik Scott read one joke off a teleprompter that said their hearts go out to everyone who lost their homes - including the makers of Joker 2.\nIt got a big laugh and O'Brien called it the best joke delivery of the night.\nIt was Zoe Salda\u00f1a's first Oscar, winning best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez - a musical about a transgender Mexican drug lord - and it marked one of the most powerful and emotional speeches of the night. \nShe broke down in tears immediately, crying out \"Mommy\", to her mother in the audience.\n\"I am floored by this honour,\" she wept, paying tribute to her fellow nominees for their \"loving and community\", saying \"I will pay it forward\".\nPraising the film's cast and crew, she got emotional as she talked about her family.\n\"Everything brave, outrageous and good I've ever done in my life is because of you,\" she said, praising her husband, his \"beautiful hair\" and their three sons.\n\"My grandmother came to this country in 1961 - I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hardworking hands.\n\"I'm the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award and I know I won't be the last.\n\"Getting an award where I got to sing and speak in Spanish - this is for my grandmother.\"\nThe month-long saga to obtain a US visa by two Iranian filmmakers ended in the pair winning the best animated short film Academy Award - with them rushing to even make the ceremony in Hollywood. \nHossein Molayemi and Shirin Sohani arrived at Los Angeles airport just hours before the Oscars award ceremony was due to begin.\nAfter their plane landed, they quickly changed outfits in a public restroom and made it with only moments to go before winning the award for their film, In the Shadow of the Cypress.\n\"It's not our fault we are so late,\" Sohani said to BBC News before the show. \"We couldn't get a visa. It's a difficult relationship\" between the US and Iran, she explained.\n\"Until yesterday we hadn't obtained our visa and now we are standing here with this statuette in our hands,\" said Molayemi in his acceptance speech.\n\"Speaking in front of this expectant audience is very hard for us,\" he added. \"Yes, if we preserve and remain faithful, miracles will happen.\"\nAs ever, politics reared its head during Sunday night's ceremony.\nHost O'Brien made a quip about how Anora was \"having a good night\", before saying: \"I guess Americans are excited to see somebody finally stand up to a powerful Russian.\"\nO'Brien must have been writing his monologue up to the very last minute, because the joke appeared to be a nod to the White House spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump.\nMeanwhile, the No Other Land documentary team descended on the red carpet wearing Palestinian scarves and Kufiya. Their film is set in the occupied West Bank. After they won for the film, the team took the stage and called out US policy in the region.\nKill Bill star Daryl Hannah also veered into politics while on stage. She referenced the war in Ukraine, saying \"Slava Ukraini\", the country's salute, as she presented an award.\nBut one person wasn't mentioned. \nHere in liberal Hollywood, you may have expected jokes and barbs toward Donald Trump - but his name didn't come up even once.",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year.

I want everyone at home to believe what's possible. We've been through so much as a sport, so much effort goes on behind the scenes and we're in Las Vegas - it's exciting. We should enjoy and embrace it.\"\nLike being in a washing machine - England's tough night in Vegas\nEngland suffer record defeat as Australia score 90\nWigan impress in Las Vegas with win over Warrington\nAt the iconic Allegiant Stadium, one of the world's most impressive sporting arenas and home to NFL side the Las Vegas Raiders, Radlinski's Wigan put on a show befitting their tag as World Club Champions, soundly beating Warrington Wolves in the event's opening match. \nEngland Women suffered a record defeat in their historic international against Australia. \nThere were victories too for Canberra Raiders and Penrith Panthers in the NRL matches.\nBut for even the most loyal travelling fans and the broader game, this was about much more than results.\n\"This is what this is all about, the opportunity to put the game in a new global territory in front of new audiences while also giving the players and the fans new experiences,\" said Rhodri Jones, the managing director of RL Commerical and one of those charged with building the English rugby league brand.\nMore than 45,000 people attended the Allegiant Stadium during the course of the four games - an increase of around 5,000 on last season's two matches\n\"I think we've grasped the opportunity with both hands, I don't think we could have done any more. \n\"Hopefully people at home have seen this has been an unbelievable event and hopefully it will be even better next year. \n\"The number of ticket sales is better than last year so that tells you that we have collectively made an impact.\"\nBut where does the game go from here? A number of English clubs have already expressed an interest in playing in next year's event, which has now been confirmed as again featuring Super League sides. \nIt is fairly easy to see why.

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

        "article_text": "Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge.\nThese are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world.\nThen there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines.\n\"The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,\" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.\nNorth Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.\nSince then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.\nBut after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.\nLast Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.\nAmong them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.\nBen Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to \"being on a school trip\". \"You can't leave the hotel without the guides,\" he said.\n\"A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,\" said Mike. \"I've never had to do that anywhere in the world.\"\nDespite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. \"Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see.\"\nOn his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.\nFor now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the \"big-hitting monuments\" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.\nSet up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.\nJoe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. \"I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,\" he said.\nJoe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.\n\"This was the only place people weren't expecting us,\" Joe said. \"It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it.\"\nBut according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.\nCovid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. \"On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks.\" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.\nIt is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.\nLocal guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.\nEven Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. \"Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,\" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. \"It felt like they opened the doors just for us.\"\nThe regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise \"the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed\".  His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling \"his grandma's living room\". The whole window was cracked.\n\"They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there\", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.\nOne of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.\nThey knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. \"I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me.\"\nSuch conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.\nMike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. \"I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,\" he said.\n\"Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.\"\nFor Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: \"North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important.\"\nBut tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.\n\"This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,\" she said.\nOne conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. \"I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,\" he said.",

I don't know how long it will take.

But, from personal experience, he knows talking about a team and managing one is two entirely different things.\n\"That (winning the Premier League) is the goal,\" said Amorim. \"To be naive is to think we are going to do it this season or be the best contender next season.\n\"I know in this moment, everybody knows everything. I was a pundit when I finished my [playing] career. I know it's really easy.\n\"Maybe it is not with me but our goal, as a club, is to win the Premier League like we did in the past with all the great glories and legends of this club.\n\"We are in a difficult moment.

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

He said that he had worked on strengthening the agency's machine learning and AI tools.\nCalifornian Democratic Congressman Jared Huffman said people across the US \"depend on NOAA for free, accurate forecasts, severe weather alerts, and emergency information\". \nNOAA weather data is used by meteorologists, media organisations, commerical forecasting services and other companies to inform the US public about the weather. The agency produces the latest information on temperature, precipitation, air quality, UV index, humidity and more. \nThis data is used extensively in the private sector to fuel popular weather services and websites.\n\"Most or all private weather companies in US (including forecasts that you see on TV or your favorite app) are built directly atop backbone of taxpayer-funded instrumentation, data, predictive modeling, & forecasts provided by NOAA,\" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles wrote on X.\nThe agency has proved essential during periods of extreme weather conditions as well. The National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service - housed under NOAA - create models and notify millions of Americans when and how to respond to severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. \nHuffman lamented the loss of \"hundreds of scientists and experts at NOAA\" who helped collect infromation that kept the public safe during dangerous weather events. \n\"Musk's sham mission is bringing vital programs to a screeching halt. Purging the government of scientists, experts, and career civil servants and slashing fundamental programs will cost lives,\" the congressman said.\nMiyoko Sakashita, the Center for Biological Diversity's oceans director, said gutting NOAA will \"hamstring essential lifesaving\" programmes.\nThe latest developments come days after US government workers faced widespread confusion following conflicting advice over compliance with a Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination.\nThe message sent to millions of federal employees last Saturday evening came after Musk posted on his social media platform X that government staff would \"shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week\".\nOn Sunday, Musk said in some cases \"we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks\". \nIn a copy of the email obtained by the BBC, employees were asked to respond explaining their accomplishments from the past week in five bullet points - without disclosing classified information.\nBut, key agencies, including the Departments of Defense (DoD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice, the Pentagon and the FBI - now led by Trump appointees -instructed employees to ignore the directive.\nAgencies such as the Department of Transportation, the Secret Service and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency encouraged their staff to comply, according to reports.\nOn Wednesday, Musk reiterated the suggestion that a number of federal employees who did not respond to an email requesting a summary of their achievements from the previous week could be \"dead\" or \"not real people\", but offered no facts to back it up.\nSpeaking at Trump's first cabinet meeting, Musk told reporters: \"I think that email perhaps was best interpreted as a performance review, but actually it was a pulse check review. \n\"Do you have a pulse? Do you have a pulse? And two neurons. So if you have a pulse and two neurons, you can reply to an email.\"\nElsewhere on Thursday, a federal judge in San Francisco found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful.\nDistrict Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including at the defence department.",

        "article_text": "French photographer Gilles Sabri\u00e9 captured this dystopian scene as the world headed towards lockdown in February 2020.\nOn Saturday 25 January 2020, millions of Chinese people started celebrating the Lunar New Year. The country's megacities saw huge temporary migrations as people left to celebrate with friends and family in distant towns and cities, as they did every January.\nThat year, however, there was a dramatic difference. Many of the people who left to celebrate were unable to return for weeks or even months. A type of pneumonia that had appeared in the western Chinese city of Wuhan the previous December had quietly became a concern. By the time Chinese revellers boarded trains and planes home a month later it had become a crisis.\nFrench photographer Gilles Sabri\u00e9 was in Beijing at that very moment, as the seriousness of the Wuhan virus became more evident. \"The photo editor at the New York Times had asked me to roam Beijing and take some pictures of the atmosphere. I just gotten back from holidays and I didn't know what to expect.\"\nWuhan was already in lockdown, though these measures hadn't yet been adopted by other Chinese cities. Even so, Sabri\u00e9 found the city sombre and eerily quiet. \"There were very, very few people anywhere. Most restaurants were closed. Everybody was worried that the disease would spread to Beijing.\n\"What made the situation probably more anxious is people didn't have much trust in what the authorities were saying. Initially, they had said there was no human-to-human transmission, then, just a few days later, they reverse and then go into full lockdown for Wuhan, a city of 10 million.\"\nSabri\u00e9 says the Chinese authorities had stressed that there had been few deaths in Beijing, a city of 23 million people. \"The question is, could we trust those figures? That was a big thing,\" Sabri\u00e9 says. Beijing's citizens began to shy away from the routines of city life, encouraged by public health messages to limit the spread. \"It was not a firm lockdown, like you had to stay home, but basically, you were encouraged to limit your movements,\" Sabri\u00e9 says.\nThe result was an eerie emptiness in a city usually bustling with life. The subways were empty; those who hadn't left for the provinces were staying home. The stillness was dramatic, but lacked a human reference point. \"It was quite paradoxical, because when you need to shoot something empty, actually you need people. If it's fully empty, it's not as strong.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022\u00a0Covid-19: The heat-showing shape of things to come\n\u2022\u00a0Is Covid becoming less deadly?\n\u2022\u00a0Why Covid-19 isn't yet seasonal\nSabri\u00e9 had an idea. Near Beijing is a resort area called Lake Houhai, a locale with many traditional houses and usually packed with sightseers day and night. When he turned up, \"it was around dinner time\", Sabri\u00e9 says, when the area would usually be crowded with people. \"This place is a must-see for any tourist, Chinese or foreign, who comes and visits Beijing. It's full of bars [and] tourist shops. Those bars usually play very loud music\u2026 each bar is louder than the next one, trying to attract more people.\"\nInstead, the bars were silent and the streets empty. Then Sabri\u00e9 spotted just one bar that wasn\u2019t completely void of life. Behind the pane of a large window, sat a lone man, softly illuminated by an overhead light. \"He was there by himself in the middle of this place which should have been bustling with life and music and sound and people,\" says Sabri\u00e9. But there was this man \"having his dinner from plastic dishes, his only companion a cat unaware of what was going on, of the tension and the anxiety\".\nThe photo is a scene in which more appears the longer you look at it. The man sits amid the normal detritus of a makeshift meal, his face gently lit by the glow of his phone. Around him lies the plush bar seating, a red pillar, the lights of bar in the background. At the bottom of the frame, a cat crouches on the back of a sofa. It could have been snapped in the small hours, once all the revellers have headed home. But instead, it's a marker: the end of normal life as a megacity hunkers down.\n\"I didn't get into the bar,\" Sabri\u00e9 explains. \"I just put my camera against [the] window. I don't think he ever noticed me, and I took the picture and moved on.\"\u00a0\nSabri\u00e9 says he thought little of the image after he took it, but the picture clearly resonated with the New York Times picture desk: the image was used as part of their The Great Empty special, published the following month. Sabri\u00e9 notes that the figure is unmasked \u2013 something that was becoming rare to see on the streets as the pandemic ramped up.\nSabri\u00e9's appreciation for the image has grown with the distance of five years. \"You have the darkness that reflects the darkness of the time, and the anxiety that we were feeling,\" he says. \"If you look closely at the picture, the [man] is looking at his phone.\"\nThis, Sabri\u00e9 adds, depicts another kind of darkness \"in terms of information and knowledge\" as people scoured the internet for information, in a desperate effort to understand what was happening to the world.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.\nThe decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.\nHunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.\nBut some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.\n\nIt's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.\nConservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream. \n\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon. \n\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.\nThe beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England. \nIt says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure. \nThat's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.\nNFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\". \n\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"\nWe met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".\nSince then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.\n\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.\n\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"\nAlong the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.\nNot everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.\nClinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.\n\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.\n\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"\nScotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.\nThe first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south. \nAdditional reporting by Kevin Church.",

        "article_text": "In one of the most exciting and dramatic awards seasons ever, the field is wide open in several fields. BBC film critics give their expert predictions for the major Academy Awards categories.\nCaryn James: It has been a fun awards season, watching the nominees for best picture pinball around. Anora became the early favourite as the brash young voice of the future, until the bonkers Emilia P\u00e9rez became the Oscar darling for a minute, then Conclave had its moment as the smart mainstream choice, until The Brutalist announced itself as the epic with artistic ambitions until... full circle, Anora is the frontrunner again. It says a lot about the strength and variety of films this year that such mayhem could happen at all. Anora \u2013 funny, original and a little bit heartbreaking \u2013 is the likely winner. And among the realistic choices (six of the nominees might as well be category filler, and Karla So\u00edia Gasc\u00f3n's unearthed offensive tweets shattered Emilia's chances), Anora should win. But lurking in the background is Conclave, which could win by consensus, given that voters rank their choices in this category. Simplistic scenario: votes for the top film are so scattered that Conclave finally gets the most votes because it's everybody's second choice. Plus, it really is a satisfying political thriller that happens to be set in the Vatican, and its Bafta and SAG awards are a sign of real support. In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.\nNicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. This year, things aren't so simple. What we can say, judging by all the other awards ceremonies that have been and gone this year, is that Dune: Part Two, Emilia P\u00e9rez, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance and Wicked are vanishingly unlikely to take home the biggest prize of the night. None of them has whipped up the enthusiasm that's required from both the public and the critics. That leaves us with Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Conclave \u2013 and over the last few weeks I've wavered between all four of them as the most likely best picture winner. As I write, Anora seems to be the favourite, and I can understand why. It's a film about contemporary American life made by an American auteur, and it balances uncompromising grittiness with exuberant, crowd-pleasing flair. In a year when arguments could be made for and against so many contenders, Anora has come to feel like the choice that could please everyone, so it may well complete the journey it began when it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0This is a strong category, but I doubt that the Academy's voters will go for a French director who was largely unknown in the US before she made\u00a0The Substance, so Coralie Fargeat is out. The various Emilia P\u00e9rez backlashes have hurt Jacques Audiard's chances, and A Complete Unknown hasn't received much praise for its directing as such, so James Mangold is a long shot, too. That means that the best director Oscar will either go to Sean Baker, for the verve and naturalism he brings to Anora, or to Brady Corbet, for the valiant artistic vision of The Brutalist. But the amiable Baker has made several excellent films that haven't garnered many awards, including Tangerine and The Florida Project, so I suspect that he will be the Academy's choice.\nCaryn James: This race comes down to a stark contrast, between Sean Baker, whose Anora is a beautifully orchestrated contemporary romp, and Brady Corbet, whose The Brutalist wilfully announces its ambition as the kind of film they don't make anymore, an historical epic complete with intermission. It's a good guess that Baker is likely to triumph, because he won the Directors Guild Award and the film won the Producers Guild award, two major predictors of the Oscars. And he should win. He made Anora feel effortless, but beneath that apparent ease is some masterful work, as he navigates the changes in tone \u2013 from fairy tale to screwball comedy to drama \u2013 that make the film so rich. Coralie Fargeat deserves her place here for her confident direction of The Substance, but it's really a two-man race.\nCaryn James: Adrian Brody was on his way to making this a done deal, having won every major precursor from the Golden Globe to the Bafta, until Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet got in his way by winning the SAG award for A Complete Unknown. Oscar voting had ended by the time Chalamet won, but as an indicator of how the votes go, SAG has a great track record. You can never underestimate Oscar voters' affection for a biopic, and Chalamet's take on Bob Dylan was a true embodiment of a character as well as a spot-on impersonation. But Brody is still very likely to win, and he should, for his searing performance as a Holocaust refugee. He creates a portrait of a man who is talented and ambitious, sometimes ruthless and sometimes vulnerable, and fully human. But let's acknowledge how strong the category is this year, the rare case where it would be perfectly appropriate for Ralph Fiennes, Colman Domingo or Sebastian Stan to win too.\nNicholas Barber: Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) are neck and neck, so it's tricky to say which attributes will tempt the Academy more. Will it be pain, anguish and a Hungarian accent, or a nifty impersonation elevated by some expert singing and guitar-picking? Will it be the long-awaited return to greatness of a Hollywood stalwart who has already won an Oscar, or the crowning of a fresh-faced youngster who has nonetheless amassed a tremendous body of work? It could go either way, but Chalamet's Oscar campaigning has been flawless \u2013 he has shown himself to be fun-loving and self-mocking, but at recent awards ceremonies, including Sunday's SAG Awards, he has emphasised how seriously he takes a difficult job \u2013 so I'm betting on him. My own personal favourite is the wonderfully versatile Ralph Fiennes, who is so quiet and reserved yet so racked by doubt in Conclave \u2013 but I doubt that this is his year.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here. Both Moore and Torres won Golden Globes for their roles, in a musical / comedy and in a drama respectively, and for most of the time since then, they've been the frontrunners. Madison shook things up when she won the Bafta, so it's now the closest of calls. But I reckon that Moore will win. Partly, that's because of her savagely self-parodying performance as a former A-list star being turned into a monster by the ageist entertainment industry. And partly it's because her comeback narrative, as spelt out in her Golden Globes acceptance speech, would furnish the Academy with the kind of feelgood story it loves so much.\nCaryn James: Demi Moore has been on an almost steady march toward her first Oscar, marred only by Mikey Madison's Bafta, ever since her pitch-perfect campaign/acceptance speech on winning the Golden Globe for The Substance. Moore checks all the boxes: the story of how Hollywood finally takes her seriously, the insider status and the no-holds-barred performance in a film with a resonant message. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win. Torres gives a beautifully nuanced, restrained performance in\u00a0I'm Still Here\u00a0as a grieving yet determined widow during Brazil's political dictatorship. But Oscars tend to go to screaming, yelling, tearing-down-the-scenery roles, which is what The Substance and Anora call for. A brilliantly subtle performance like Torres's has an uphill battle.\nCaryn James: There's a reason Kieran Culkin has won every major award in this category in the run-up to the Oscars: he really deserves to. His wilfully outrageous, sad and moving character of Benji in A Real Pain may have echoes of his role as Roman Roy in Succession, but it is also funny and affecting on its own, a delicate mix of comedy and tragedy. And it hasn't hurt his chances that every acceptance speech of his is wry, self-deprecating and fun to watch. Some winners make an earnest point of saying \"There is no winner\" or spreading the praise around, but Culkin has turned acceptances into a stand-up art form. In another year, Edward Norton might have taken the award for his sharply drawn performance as Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, but that seems like a very unlikely upset.\nNicholas Barber: This year's Oscars are harder to predict than usual, but the best supporting actor category is the exception that proves the rule. Ever since Kieran Culkin won the Golden Globe for his role in A Real Pain in January, he has kept on winning and winning \u2013 and now it feels as if there is no point in any of his competitors turning up to the ceremony at all. Even those of us who would argue that Culkin isn't really a supporting actor in the film, but a co-lead with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg, have had to accept the inevitable. The only regrettable part of the whole business is that this category is stacked with Oscar-worthy performances, namely Yura Borisov's soft-hearted Russian muscle in Anora, Edward Norton's gentle Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce's bluff tycoon in The Brutalist, and Culkin's old Succession co-star Jeremy Strong as controversial lawyer Roy Cohn in The Apprentice. If they hadn't been up against Culkin, any one of them might have won.\nNicholas Barber: For a while it looked as if Zoe Salda\u00f1a had this Oscar in the bag. Of course,\u00a0she isn't really a supporting actress\u00a0in Emilia P\u00e9rez, but one of the leads. As soon as voters put her in this category, though, it seemed to be hers for the taking. Not only does she deliver a fabulous performance that includes energetic song-and-dance numbers, but she is a mainstay of the Marvel and Star Trek cinematic universes, so she has helped Hollywood make zillions of dollars. Then a journalist uncovered Those Social Media Posts. The bigoted remarks made by the other star of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, stripped the film of much of its goodwill, and Salda\u00f1a's hopes were badly damaged in the explosion of recriminations. Oscars observers started wondering: Would Ariana Grande win for Wicked, instead? It's still possible, but Saldana has distanced herself smartly from the scandal, and made emotional speeches at other award ceremonies, including the Baftas and the SAG Awards, so the Academy will probably reward her for her work, rather than punish her for her co-star's opinions.\nCaryn James: Zoe Salda\u00f1a may be the one person to escape unscathed from the Emilia P\u00e9rez debacle, and get the Oscar, as she should. She has won every precursor award, and is actually the dynamic centre of the story. Rita, the lawyer who helps the title character to transition and create a new identity, gives Salda\u00f1a her richest role yet and she makes the most of it. Rita starts as a fiery, beleaguered small-town lawyer, wrestles with her conscience about being involved with a criminal, and eventually becomes a philanthropist, and Salda\u00f1a sings and dances her way through it all with grace and presence. And she had the perfectly crafted answer when first asked about her co-star's offensive tweets, saying she was \"saddened\". Very well played. Isabella Rossellini makes a huge impact as Sister Agnes in a small role in Conclave, and Monica Barbaro is amazing as she channels Joan Baez in A Complete Unknown, but they can't complete with Salda\u00f1a's Rita.\nCaryn James: Peter Straughan is sure to win for Conclave. He turns Robert Harris's potboiler novel into a sleek, thoughtful screenplay, which is a huge part of what makes the film \u2013 pretty talky when you think about it, and not exactly an action movie \u2013 so suspenseful and entertaining. Turning that straightforward novel into a faithful screenplay may sound simple, but in fact Straughn's adaptation has a magician's deft touch, taking the best of the story and making it much better. It's great to see that RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes's screenplay for Ross's Nickel Boys is nominated. It's a dazzling adaptation of Colson Whitehead's extremely literary novel, but the film hasn't received the kind of major awards traction it would need to compete. The rest of the category is fairly weak. The screenplay is the least of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Sing Sing is less about script than performance. And the banal screenplay for the biopic A Complete Unknown shouldn't even have a place in this conversation.\nNicholas Barber: Peter Straughan's gripping adaptation of Robert Harris's novel, Conclave, has picked up prizes at the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice awards, and the Baftas. And when Conclave won best picture at the Baftas, the film's director, Edward Berger, made a point of singing Straughan's praises. Is he unbeatable at this stage? The controversies swirling around Emilia P\u00e9rez may have put it out of the running \u2013 as adventurous as Jacques Audiard's screenplay is \u2013 and there doesn't seem to be much chatter about A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys and Sing Sing in this category. So, yes, unless there are some Conclave-style shenanigans going on behind closed doors, Straughan should triumph here.\nNicholas Barber: This is one of this year's toughest categories to predict. September 5 hasn't built any momentum over awards season, but the other four best screenplay nominees \u2013 Anora, The Brutalist, A Real Pain, The Substance \u2013 are all brilliant in their own distinctive ways, and were all written or co-written by the films' directors. Sean Baker's Anora script won at the WGA Awards; Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold's The Brutalist was given the prize by two US critics' organisations; Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain won at the Baftas, and Coralie Fargeat's The Substance won at Cannes last year. My own preference, in a year of extremely long films, is Eisenberg's precision-engineered screenplay for A Real Pain, because it doesn't waste a scene, or a syllable of dialogue, in a trim 90 minutes. But I think that Anora will beat it, which would be OK by me, too.\nCaryn James: This is one of the richest categories, with three very different, thoroughly deserving nominees. Sean Baker's Anora is fresh and bold. Coralie Fargeat's The Substance is audacious and zeitgeisty. And Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain is perceptive and humane to its core. Anora and The Substance were also nominated for best picture, a sign of strength that might give them an edge. But I'm guessing that A Real Pain, which should win, will come through in the end. Where Anora and especially The Substance owe a lot to those films' initial concepts, Eisenberg's screenplay is the work of a writer with an ear for making his dialogue both believable and affecting. Of course, Anora is coming on so strong in other categories, you can't possibly rule it out, but if voters want to spread the awards around they may see this as a chance to give A Real Pain some well-earned recognition.\u00a0\nCaryn James: Once, this race seemed down to Emilia P\u00e9rez v I'm Still Here, but Emilia's implosion clears the way for I'm Still Here, which will win now and always should have. Walter Salles's brilliantly moving story of a family dealing with the aftermath of their father's disappearance during the Brazilian dictatorship in the 1970s is an eloquent, timely masterpiece that reveals the personal cost of politics. The film is nominated for best picture, which it surely won't win, and Fernanda Torres for actress, where winning would be an upset, but those nominations are a sign of strength that will translate into winning the International prize. There isn't a weak film in this category, with The Seed of the Sacred Fig another standout, but I'm Still Here towers above the others. There were celebrations in Brazil at the nominations alone, and although Brazilian films have been nominated before, including Salles's 1998 Central Station, it looks like the celebrations will go on for the country's first Oscar in this category.\nNicholas Barber: A storm of bad publicity knocked Emilia P\u00e9rez off-course this awards season, and suddenly it seemed as if one of its competitors might grab the Oscar for best international film. The most likely of these would be I'm Still Here, a powerful and popular Brazilian political drama whose star, Fernanda Torres, has been nominated for best actress. Also in with a chance are Flow, a Latvian cartoon which is nominated for best animated feature film, and The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which was made in secret in Iran by Mohammad Rasoulof, and then smuggled out of the country. But a week is a long time in awards season, and the Oscars take place a whole month after Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's offensive tweets were unearthed. My hunch is that the storm is passing, and that Emilia P\u00e9rez, which won the equivalent prize at the Baftas, will get its Oscar, after all.\nNicholas Barber: Nineteen years ago, Nick Park (and his co-director) won the Oscar for Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Nine years ago, the Oscar went to Pixar's Inside Out. Follow-ups to both films are nominated this year, and as this is one category in which voters aren't averse to handing prizes to sequels, either of them could win. Things are looking especially promising for Aardman's claymation caper, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, a favourite of mine which nabbed not one but two Baftas \u2013 one for animated feature film and one for children's / family film. The dialogue-free Latvian charmer, Flow, has its cheerleaders, too, whereas Memoir of a Snail, an Australian stop-motion animation, is just too gloomy to get voters behind it. That leaves the nominee which I believe will win: The Wild Robot. It's a sci-fi epic, yet it has a big heart and loveable picture-book visuals. Besides, its writer-director, Chris Sanders, made Lilo & Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon, but has never won an Oscar. Surely his peers will want to rectify that this year?\nCaryn James: How important is box office? That may be the deciding factor in this race, which is between two eco-themed films: The Wild Robot, the frontrunner, and Flow, its only likely competition. Flow is a true original, a dialogue-free Latvian film about a cat who tries to survive a flood. The Wild Robot is a funny, heart-tugging story about an intelligent robot, voiced by Lupita Nyong'o, who grows a human heart after being stranded on an island full of animal creatures facing an environmental crisis of its own. The Wild Robot has starry voices, including Pedro Pascal as Fink the Fox and Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, and it has earned more than $300m. In itself that might not be enough to get the Oscar, but the combination of star power, a timely message and its popularity with audiences is likely to make it the winner. And it is charming, so fair enough. The attention to Flow so far might be its best reward.\nCaryn James: There are years when documentaries with urgent political messages become the undeniable frontrunners and inevitable winners, such as Navalny in 2023 and 20 Days in Mariupol last year. This is one of those years. The extraordinary No Other Land will win and it should. Its eye-opening first-hand look at a village in the West Bank from 2019 to 2023, when Israeli forces destroyed homes and displaced the villagers, makes the cost of the conflict visceral. The film's backstory is compelling: it was made by a team of Israelis and two Palestinians, whose personal stories shape the film. And it resonates with even more impact since the turmoil in the Middle East continues. The film has not found a US distributor despite earning awards from several festival and critics' groups. but it has done very well in self-distribution. A vote for it might even convince the Hollywood players who have the power to release it wider.\nNicholas Barber: The past two winners of the Oscar for best documentary feature were 20 Days in Mariupol, which celebrated the resilience of the Ukrainian people during the current war, and Navalny, which condemned Vladimir Putin's regime. That trend could well continue this year, at a time when those inter-related topics are more urgent than ever, with the prize going to Porcelain War. Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev's film offers an intense, citizen's-eye view of the conflict in Ukraine, and shows civilians being trained as combatants. What separates it from other such documentaries is that the main participants, Leontyev and his wife Anya Stasenko, are artists who sculpt and paint exquisitely patterned porcelain animals. The theme is the importance of storytelling and creativity as ways to resist oppression \u2013 and what could be more appealing to Hollywood's film-making community than that?\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0If voters feel that a film as lucrative as Wicked shouldn't go away empty-handed, then giving it the prize for best original score is one obvious way for them to show it some love. But my money is on Daniel Blumberg's awe-inspiring score for The Brutalist, which won the Bafta in the same category. One of the questions raised by Brady Corbet's film is how such a low-budget indie drama can seem so epic, and the music has a lot to do with it. It's big, bold and experimental, with strange ticking and clinking noises to establish the theme of construction, stately motifs to echo the characters' grand ambitions, and some symphonic bombast and wild jazz to convey the thrill of arriving in the US in the middle of the 20th Century. It's also deeply eerie at times, so you can expect it to be used on trailers for horror films and science-fiction sagas for years to come.\nCaryn James: It might seem like Emilia P\u00e9rez and Wicked have the edge, but the songs that pop out of these musicals have their own category. Here, the award for the background music is between Conclave's Volker Bertelmann, who won the Oscar for his music in\u00a0All Quiet on the Western Front\u00a0(like Conclave, directed by Edward Berger), or Daniel Blumberg, who won this year's Bafta for his score for The Brutalist. Both scores serve their films well. Bertelmann's classical style adds suspense to the Vatican thriller. But I'd give the edge to Blumberg, who should win for his evocative score that adds a touch of the contemporary to the film's post-World War Two setting. Sometimes jazz-infused, sometimes commanding, his score enhances the mood without thwacking viewers over the head.\nCaryn James: The film that should win wasn't even nominated. It's still a head-scratcher why Jomo Fray's eloquent, imaginative cinematography for Nickel Boys, which gracefully meshed with director RaMell Ross's first-person narrative, wasn't acknowledged, while the film got a best picture nod. But there are two very strong contenders among the nominees. The Brutalist, shot in old-style, widescreen, rarely used VistaVision, has epic sweep, and is full of clarity. And Nosferatu's cinematography is a beautiful mix of colour in its scenes of daily life, and darkness in the shadowy world of the vampire. Jarin Blaschke, who has worked on previous, stunning Robert Eggers's films, equals that work in Nosferatu and should win. But The Brutalist and Lol Crawley probably will, if only because the film has been so much in the awards conversation, while Nosferatu definitely hasn't.\nNicholas Barber: The fact that Nickel Boys didn't get onto the shortlist for its immersive first-person camerawork is one of the Oscars' most puzzling oversights this year, and it's a shame, too, that the stylish Conclave was ignored. Of the films that were nominated, Nosferatu boasts glorious mountain vistas and shadowy Victorian chambers, while The Brutalist has the geeky appeal of large-format VistaVision film stock. But I have a feeling that the Academy will honour Greig Fraser's stunning views of uncanny alien worlds in Dune: Part Two. After all, voters have to give at least something to bona-fide Hollywood blockbusters, and this would be a worthwhile way for them to do so.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Best actressNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here.",

        "article_text": "European leaders have rallied behind Volodymyr Zelensky after Donald Trump's furious exchange with the Ukrainian president in the White House.\nThe leaders of Germany, France, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were among those who posted social media messages backing Ukraine - with Zelensky responding directly to each one to thank them for their support.\nThe Ukrainian president has arrived in London to attend a summit hosted by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who \"retains unwavering support for Ukraine\", Downing Street said.\nIt comes after extraordinary scenes in the Oval Office on Friday as US President Trump clashed with Zelensky, telling him to make a deal with Russia \"or we are out\".\nAt one point, Trump told Zelensky he was not thankful enough for US military and political support during Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nAs a flurry of supportive messages for Ukraine were posted by European leaders following the row - along with posts from the prime ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealand - Zelensky replied to each one: \"Thank you for your support.\"\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron posted: \"There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so.\"\nDutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the Netherlands supports Ukraine \"now more than ever\", adding: \"We want a lasting peace and an end to the war of aggression started by Russia. For Ukraine and its people, and for Europe.\"\nGermany's outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote that \"no one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine\", with his replacement-in-waiting Friedrich Merz adding that \"we stand with Ukraine\" and \"we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war\".\nGermany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said the \"unspeakable\" row resembled a \"bad dream\" and \"underlined that a new age of infamy has begun\". \nShe said she would \"wholeheartedly push\" for measures that could help Ukraine \"withstand Russia's aggression even if the US withdraws support, so that it can achieve a just peace and not a capitulation\".\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: \"Ukraine, Spain stands with you,\" while his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk wrote: \"Dear [Zelensky], dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone.\"\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada \"will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace\".\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese posted that his country had \"proudly supported the brave people of Ukraine in their struggle to defend their sovereignty against the brutality of Russian aggression and in support of international law\".\nEuropean Union chiefs Antonio Costa and Ursula von der Leyen assured Zelensky in a joint statement that he was \"never alone\".\n\"We will continue working with you for a just and lasting peace,\" they said.\nThere were also supportive messages for Ukraine from political leaders in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Romania, Sweden and Slovenia.\nHowever, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban voiced his support for Trump, writing: \"Strong men make peace, weak men make war. Today President @realDonaldTrump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr President!\"\nOn Saturday, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told the BBC he had spoken with Zelensky twice following the White House meeting.\nHe said he was \"not at liberty to say what was discussed\" but shared that he told Zelensky \"we have to respect\" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far.\nHe said Zelensky must \"find a way\" to restore his relationship with his US counterpart. \nZelensky left the White House early following his row with Trump - but afterwards thanked the US president on social media for his support, saying: \"Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"\nWriting on messenger app Telegram on Saturday, Zelensky said it was \"very important for us that Ukraine is heard and that no one forgets about it, neither during the war nor after\".\n\"It is important for people in Ukraine to know that they are not alone, that their interests are represented in every country, in every corner of the world,\" he added.\nIn an interview with Fox News following his White House visit, Zelensky said his row with Trump was \"not good for both sides\" but he thought the relationship could be salvaged.\nThe pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing an agreement that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals.\nFriday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sitting alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy.\nZelensky responded by asking \"what kind of diplomacy?\", referencing a previous 2019 ceasefire deal that was agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east.\nThe vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and \"litigating\" the situation in front of the media.\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called for a summit \"without delay\" between the US, Europe and allies on Ukraine.\nSir Keir's crunch talks at Downing Street on Sunday will see European leaders gear up efforts to police a future Ukraine peace deal.\nThe UK prime minister believes a deal will have to involve US military assets providing surveillance, intelligence and potentially warplanes giving air cover to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

The hosts went to the corner from the penalty and Timoney dotted down at the tail of a powerful maul.\nBuoyed by the score, Ulster enjoyed a spell of pressure but when next awarded a penalty, opted to go for the posts and reduce the deficit rather than try their maul again. \nIt was the same policy only minutes before half-time when, only a metre into Scarlets' half, Jack Murphy again called for the tee and his lengthy effort just crept over the crossbar to put his side ahead for the first time. \nUlster could not carry their advantage into the turn, however, with Ioan Lloyd kicking his side back in front after an offside penalty in the final passage of the half.\nJack Murphy kicked 13 points for Ulster\nMurphy and Lloyd traded efforts off the tee in the early exchanges of the second half, but as the game entered the final half hour, Ulster turned down a series of kickable penalties before Callum Reid eventually burrowed his way over the line from close range. \nScarlets were back on top soon after, however, as Dwayne Peel's side capitalised on more scrappy play from Ulster as Matt Dalton tried to keep the bouncing ball alive but instead scooped it into the arms of Alec Hepburn. \nThe Scarlets prop offloaded for Vaea Fifita and there was to be no catching the back row replacement as he galloped into open space and under the posts. \nThe Welsh region had a golden chance to move two scores ahead entering the final 10 minutes of the game but, after sustained pressure, the ball squirted loose from a ruck almost on the Ulster line and James McNabney hacked clear. \nThey would instead make do with another penalty from the boot of Lloyd but their failure to make it a two-score lead loomed large in the end as O'Connor barged over from close range two minutes from time.\nUlster: Moore; Lowry, Hume, McCloskey, Stockdale; Murphy, McKee; Reid, Herring, Wilson, O'Connor (capt), Dalton, Matty Rea, Timoney, McNabney.\nReplacements: Andrew, Crean, O'Toole, Treadwell, McCann, Doak, Flannery, Postlethwaite. \nScarlets: Nicholas; Page, Roberts, Williams, Lewis; Lloyd, Davies; Hepburn, Elias (capt), Wainwright, Craig, Lousi, Douglas, Davis, Taylor.\nReplacements: Van der Merwe, O'Connor, Hawley, Price, Fifita, Hughes, Titcombe, Evans.\nReferee: Sam Grove-White (SRU)",

However, her proposal has few other details and has been criticised.\nThe ecology ministry, when asked by the BBC, had no further information on where a sanctuary might be located or who would fund its construction and running costs.\nLoro Parque, a marine zoo in Spain that wants to receive the killer whales from Marineland, told the BBC this week the current proposal was \"wholly unsuitable\" and that they were best positioned to care for them.\nChristoph Kiessling, vice-president of the facility in Tenerife, said whale sanctuaries were \"currently unable to meet the complex physiological, social and environmental needs\" of killer whales.\nMost designs involve cordoning off a bay and employing staff to ensure Wikie and Keijo - who were born in captivity and cannot be released into the wild - were properly fed and looked after.\nKiessling did say such a solution might be possible if there was more extensive research and planning but \"such a process could take years, leaving the two Marineland [orcas] in a facility that is being wound down\".\nCampaigners point out that several orcas have died at Loro Parque in the last few years, including three between March 2021 and September 2022.\nManagers at the marine zoo said scientific examination of those orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria showed the deaths were unavoidable.\nThey also fear Wikie might be used for breeding. Loro Parque announced in January that Morgan, the only female of the three orcas currently kept there, is pregnant.\nKatheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection, said Loro Parque was ultimately an entertainment business that used orcas to make money.\nShe added: \"Morgan's pregnancy underlines the fact that Loro Parque could never be a suitable option for Wikie and Keijo and should be removed as an option.\"\nMarineland, who are still paying to look after the orcas, said a move to Loro Parque as soon as possible was in the best interests of the animals' welfare. They have asked the ecology ministry to approve the transfer.\nThe whale sanctuary in Canada applied to the French government to take in the orcas last year but their bid was rejected in January.\nThey were told the site they had selected in Nova Scotia was too far away and that the water there was too cold for Wikie and Keijo, who have spent their whole lives in southern France.\nFollowing Pannier-Runacher's proposal for a sanctuary in Europe, which she announced a fortnight ago in a video on Instagram, the directors of the rejected Canadian project criticised the idea of one being built in the Mediterranean.\nThey wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland. These two orcas do not belong to the ecotypes seen in the Mediterranean.\"\nHe added: \"The possibility of building a sanctuary for them in the Mediterranean is probably the worst of the possible options.\" \nThe directors also said, unlike the European proposal, their sanctuary was ready to begin construction as the design had already been finalised.\nOther animal rights groups have been more welcoming of Pannier-Runacher's announcement, saying a European sanctuary would still be better for the orcas' welfare than life in another marine zoo.\nSea Shepherd, a marine conservation society, replied to the minister on Instagram saying this was a chance to achieve what the zoo industry calls \"impossible\" - the building of an ocean sanctuary where captive orcas can enjoy the rest of their lives.\nPannier-Runacher said in her video she was keenly aware of the strong feelings people had about where Wikie and Keijo should be rehomed.\nShe did not rule out sending them to Loro Parque or other marine zoos, only that she would \"oppose any transfer to a site that is not suitable for accommodating\" orcas.\nLast November she blocked an application by Marineland to send the killer whales to a marine zoo in Japan, citing lower animal welfare regulations in the country.\nThe 'Year of the Sea' is currently underway in France, a government initiative to raise awareness about the importance of the ocean, and Pannier-Runacher believes the creation of a European whale sanctuary would be a fitting testament to it.\n\"I'm not telling you that it will work,\" she told Instagram users. \"But nothing ventured, nothing gained.\"",

It made Pidcock look imperious in Saudi Arabia, but it's how he will look in Belgium and France as the season progresses that will define his year - and possibly the double Olympic mountain bike champion's road-race career.\nVery little information about how the relationship with one of Ineos' biggest talents broke down has made it outside the team bus. Which leaves many looking for clues within what both team and athlete say - even while they are trying not to say much.\n\"I think it's as simple as the word 'compatibility',\" said Ineos CEO John Allert during a pre-season press call. \"There's no guarantees in life... I think Tom and the team probably realised we'd come to a point of recognising that.\n\"I think the whole Tom topic might be one for a book in 10 years' time.\"\nIt's as telling, especially in Allert's last line, as it is diplomatic.\nThere's little doubt there was a fallout: they dropped him from competing in the final big race of last season - the Il Lombardia 'monument' classic across Italy's wealthy northern region. A one-day event Pidcock was perfect for.\nPidcock himself gave his own clues to BBC Sport during his second training camp before the new season. \"I feel fresher, more energised. I feel like it's my own journey, taking control and being in charge of my own destiny. It's a really nice feeling as well.\"\nThe past few seasons had seen Ineos shift from a winning machine to a more relaxed and autonomous environment, which would seemingly suit a young, nonchalant, multi-discipline athlete such as Pidcock.\nThey were happy to see him throw himself into a lake off a speedboat on Instagram, or fly at breakneck speed down the dirt tracks of the Alps for Olympic glory on a different kind of bike.\nBut road cycling is changing and Ineos are making a transition into a modern 'super-team'. This includes last year's introduction of performance director Scott Drawer and a search for more sponsors on top of the already substantial backing of Ineos owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, which requires a refocus on what was their original objective as Team Sky: to win the Tour de France, again and again.\nPidcock's Q36.5 team should receive an invitation to at least one Grand Tour, but it's in the one-day races above where the Briton could excel\nPidcock himself remains confident he is capable of winning a three-week race - he has won one of the hardest stages of the hardest race of them all, of course, descending his way to folklore at 100km/h before climbing Alpe d'Huez to victory during the 2022 Tour de France.\nPidcock, however, won't be there in 2025 as cycling's biggest race would have been unlikely to accept Q36.5 this year - given their current lower UCI ProTeams status, they will rely on wildcard invites to this year's biggest World Tour races.\n\"I'm happy, I've got a year out from it... a break. When I come back it'll be [with] a refreshed energy,\" he said.\nQ36.5 will make it to at least one three-week Grand Tour this year and it allows Pidcock to focus on the one-day races, where he has excelled in recent seasons.\nHis next objective must be to win one of the five 'monument' one-day races. \"Italian races, Ardennes [classics]... all these races I want to perform in, and now be a bit more focused on them.\"\nIt's a focus which begins this weekend with the spring classics 'opening weekend', the Omloop Nieuwsblad race in Belgium.\nMore clues lie within a team seemingly behind Ineos in terms of resource.\n\"This team has super-impressed me with how much knowledge there is and expertise in certain areas,\" said Pidcock. \"This is the highest standard of people I've actually ever worked with.\"\nPidcock knows he hasn't simply jumped ship and landed hastily with a minnow. There's a lot more to a team who have already won as many races this year as they had in a whole season since 2023.\nOwned by a former mining magnate, South African Ivan Glasenberg, the team - named after the high-end cycling clothing brand - have potentially very deep pockets and a few 'prestige' sponsors in a sport which still allows big spending to pay off quickly.\nThe team was born in 2023 out of the ashes of Team Dimension Data, which under many guises won several big races as a World Tour team across the previous 15 or so years, including Mark Cavendish - wearing the yellow jersey - claiming four Tour de France stage wins in 2016.\nPidcock's 2025 began with a bang with victory overall, and on the two climbing stages, at the Alula Tour in Saudi Arabia\nTeam boss Doug Ryder, a fellow South African, led that team. And while anyone would expect an employer to be excited about their new charge, Ryder's view of Pidcock is effusive.\n\"[Pidcock's] attention to detail is next-level,\" he says. \"He focuses on every millimetre. We did a nice team-building event, and it was Tom's idea, and then he wouldn't let the team pay - just those personal things are just really, really cool.\"\nQuite the team player for a man considered by some to be the opposite at Ineos. And it's likely the biggest clue of all when it comes to Pidcock's Ineos era...\n\"Within our team, he doesn't have to fight for leadership,\" concludes Ryder. \"He will be our out-and-out leader when we go to those races.\n\"He wants to be a world champion. And he wants to ride for general classification in a Grand Tour, and show that he's one of those riders that can stand tall on the podium in the highest endurance events in our sport.\"",

        "article_text": "From Disney's Snow White to Mickey 17, these are the films to stream at home and watch in the cinema this month.\nDisney's Snow White is a live-action/ CGI remake of Walt Disney's first ever feature-length cartoon, 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but it's proven to be more controversial than the studio's other remakes. Some bigoted social-media posters objected to the casting of Rachel Zegler, an actress with Colombian heritage, as Snow White; Zegler was hit by another backlash when she described the prince in the original cartoon as a \"stalker\"; Peter Dinklage said that the portrayal of the dwarves was \"backwards\"; and Stuart Heritage in the Guardian slated the trailer as \"arguably the ugliest thing ever committed to screen\", adding that \"the design of the new dwarves feels like something that would be deliberately shown to prisoners of war to break their spirit\". On the other hand, Disney's Snow White boasts new songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (La La Land, The Greatest Showman) and a screenplay co-written by Greta Gerwig (Barbie), so its modern take on a classic fairy tale could still be a gold mine, or even a diamond mine.\nReleased in cinemas internationally on 21 March\nIf you like twisty satirical chillers set in the exclusive enclaves of super-rich eccentrics (Glass Onion, Blink Twice, The Menu \u2013 you know the sort of thing), then you're in luck: A24 has two on offer this month. In Death of a Unicorn, a father and daughter (Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega) are driving through a nature reserve owned by the father's wealthy boss (Richard E Grant) when their car crashes into a unicorn. Yes, it turns out that these fairy-tale creatures are real, and so are the magical healing properties they're reputed to have. Grant's character and his family \u2013 played by Tea Leoni and Will Poulter \u2013 are keen to exploit these properties, so a team of scientists sets about slicing up the animal's body to determine whether it really can cure cancer. Meanwhile, Opus (released on 14 March in the US) features Ayo Edebiri as a young reporter invited to the compound of a reclusive rock star played by John Malkovich.\nReleased on 28 March in the US and 4 April in the UK\nTwo months on from the release of Steven Soderbergh's last film, Presence, the ever-busy director is back with Black Bag, a spy thriller written by David Koepp (Jurassic Park). Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender play a British married couple who are also suave secret agents \u2013 a combination which isn't a problem until the wife is suspected of treason and the husband has to investigate. \"I [thought] it might be interesting to make [Edward Albee's play] Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but George and Martha are in the intelligence community,\" Soderbergh told The Hollywood Reporter. \"What would that be like? So it's a very, very specific take on people who are in the intelligence business but also have complex personal, emotional lives.\" The stellar cast includes Tom Burke, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page and Marisa Abela, along with two former James Bond regulars, Pierce Brosnan and Naomie Harris.\nReleased on 14 March in cinemas internationally\nThe Alto Knights is a crime thriller about two rival Italian American mob bosses, Frank Costello and Vito Genovese, who go from being best friends to archenemies in 1950s New York. It's directed by Barry Levinson, who made Bugsy, it's scripted by Nicholas Pileggi, the co-writer of Goodfellas, and it stars none other than Robert De Niro, so a fact-based gangster film could hardly have a more promising team behind it. The most intriguing part of the project, though, is that De Niro plays both Costello and Genovese, with just enough prosthetic make-up to stop the characters looking like identical twins. Levinson's explanation for this surprising casting? \"As kids, they were very much the same,\" the director said in Empire. \"Two guys were almost one, then they suddenly not only divide, but ultimately become enemies.\" Whether or not you're convinced, you can't complain about having two De Niro performances for the price of one.\nReleased on 21 March in the UK, the US, Canada, Ireland and Spain\nFive years after Bong Joon Ho's Parasite won the Oscars for best picture, best director, best screenplay and best international feature film, the Korean writer-director is back at last with an English-language science-fiction caper. Adapted from Edward Ashton's novel, Mickey 17 stars Robert Pattinson as Mickey, a lowly labourer on a spaceship bound for an ice planet in the year 2054. He is killed on a regular basis, but he is always \"reprinted\", with his memories and personality intact. But what happens when someone makes a mistake, and two different incarnations of Mickey are alive at the same time? David Ehrlich says in IndieWire that: \"the best and most cohesive of Bong's English-language films [is] his biggest swing to date, a wry, delightful, and resoundingly sweet mega-budget space adventure that doesn't seem to be aware that it was made by a major American studio\". On the other hand, the BBC's Hugh Montgomery felt that Mickey 17 was a \"serious disappointment\".\nReleased from 6 March in cinemas internationally\nThe horrifying story of how Charles Manson brainwashed his followers to murder innocent people in 1969 has been told in many dramas and documentaries: Quentin Tarantino even included it in Once Upon a Time\u2026 In Hollywood. But Chaos, a book by Tom O'Neill with Dan Piepenbring, argues that there is more to the story than the official version of events. According to Elisabeth Garber-Paul in Rolling Stone, the book ponders: \"the links between one of America's most notorious criminals and the government's super-secretive mind-control program MKULTRA\", and asks some disturbing questions: \"What explains the similarities between government funded, LSD-fueled mind-control experiments, and Manson's techniques? And why were there so many people in his orbit who seemed to have ties to the CIA?\" Now this investigation, which consumed 20 years of O'Neill's life, serves as the basis of a documentary by Errol Morris, the legendary director of The Thin Blue Line, The Fog of War and The Pigeon Tunnel.\nReleased on 7 March on Netflix internationally\nDirectors Anthony and Joe Russo and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely worked together on two of the biggest hits in cinema history, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. Their next collaboration, The Gray Man, wasn't so well-received, but their new film sees them return to their comfort zone, ie, it's a visual effects-packed science-fiction epic. Based on an illustrated novel by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, a Swedish artist and author, The Electric State is set in a dystopian alternate 1990s where the human race has won a war against robotkind, and the remaining \"bots\" have been exiled to a walled-off desert called the Exclusion Zone. Millie Bobby Brown plays an orphaned teenager, who treks across the Zone in search of her long-lost brother, and Chris Pratt plays a war veteran who goes with her. The only trouble is that the film's story is quite different from the novel's, and some of St\u00e5lenhag's fans aren't happy. \"Fan expectations are complicated,\" Joe Russo told\u00a0Digital Spy. \"There are characters that are directly out of the graphic novel and then there are characters that are completely invented and inspired by it.\"\nReleased on 14 March on Netflix internationally\nOne of this month's two \"having-your-life-changed-by-a-pet-you-didn't-really-want\" comedy dramas (the other being The Friend), The Penguin Lessons is based on a memoir by Tom Michell, and is directed by Peter Cattaneo (The Full Monty). Steve Coogan plays Tom, an English teacher who gets what he imagines will be a cushy job in a boys' school in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1976. But there are two complications. One is that Argentina is in the midst of a military coup. The other is that Tom rescued a penguin he found drenched in oil on a beach, and now the bird won't leave him alone. Luckily enough, the penguin's presence in his classroom helps to motivate his pupils \u2013 and it might just teach the cynical Tom a lesson or two. Isabella Soares says in Collider that: \"Cattaneo's latest project is delightful and meaningful\", thanks to Coogan's \"charming\" performance and \"the script's keen eye for comedy in the face of a tumultuous backdrop\".\nReleased on 28 March in the US\nTwo films adapted from novels by Sigrid Nunez premiered last year, both of them musings on death and friendship among literary New Yorkers. One was Pedro Almod\u00f3var's The Room Next Door, which won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival; the other is The Friend, which stars Naomi Watts, Bill Murray, and the most gigantic canine to be squeezed into a Manhattan apartment since Clifford the Big Red Dog. Watts plays an author named Iris, and Murray plays her roguish mentor Walter. After he kills himself, Iris has to look after his Great Dane, and finds that the dog is sadder about Walter's death than most of the human beings who knew him. Steve Pond in The Wrap says: \"The Friend juggles the happy, the sad and the bittersweet while somehow managing not to lose the lightness that has kept it afloat.\"\nReleased on 21 March in the US\nAlain Guiraudie, the French writer-director of the award-winning Stranger by the Lake, returns with another blackly comic, sexually charged thriller. F\u00e9lix Kysyl plays J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, a young man who returns to his rural hometown for the funeral of his mentor, a local baker. The baker's widow (Catherine Frot) invites him to stay in the family home, and perhaps even take over the family business, much to the resentment of the couple's grown-up son, Vincent (Jean-Baptiste Durand). And then someone disappears in the mossy woodland by the village. Isaac Feldberg at RogerEbert.com calls Guiraudie's film \"another elegantly haunting dissection of the power dynamics shaping queer sexuality, this time in the form of a fantastically tender, alluring, and peculiar small-town tale of murder, desire, and repression\".\nReleased on 14 March in Spain, 21 March in the US, and 28 March in the UK and Ireland\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "Located off Donegal's coast, this car-free isle was last inhabited full-time in the '70s. Now, locals are resurrecting a lost way of life \u2013 and adventurous travellers are welcome.\nFriday night on Owey Island and it's like we've been time-warped into the Ireland of years gone by. Smoke from burning turf fills the air as the small cluster of locals potter in and out of their well-maintained houses, sharing freshly caught fish and odd jobs. Friendly dogs roam free and chickens strut about. And as the roar of the sea and rustling of the reeds harmonise with warm, convivial chatter, it's hard to believe this lively haven lay dormant for decades. \u00a0\nLocated off the coast of west Donegal in the Atlantic Ocean, the remote island of Owey (or Uaigh in Irish, meaning \"cave\") is approximately 15 minutes by boat from Cruit Island, which is joined to the mainland via a short car bridge. There is no ferry service to Owey, visitors can only access the island by kayak or private boat. There's also no electricity or running water, so only the distant lights twinkling from the mainland hint of civilisation \u2013 and modern-day pressures \u2013 further away.\nLast inhabited full-time in the 1970s, the island was home to around 100 residents and about 30 families at its pinnacle. But the lure of modern conveniences on the mainland led to a dwindling population, with the last remaining islanders leaving in 1977 and the place lying abandoned for more than 25 years.\nI was spending a long weekend on Owey with the Wild Women of the Woods (Northern Ireland), an organisation of more than 4,000 members that aims to connect women from all over Ireland to experience nature and adventure together in wild, untamed settings. Outdoor enthusiast Rachel Pedder, who set up the organisation, wanted to bring the group \"somewhere that was off the beaten track and not generally accessible\".\nShe explained: \"It is hard to get to. At any of the other islands you can rock up at on a ferry and have a dander about and stay, whereas Owey it very much belongs to the community. You have to be very respectful of the fact that it's really their island and as long as you respect that, then they are welcoming.\" she added.\nPaul Cowan, one of the first wave pioneering Owey's renaissance, spent his teenage years on Owey, having moved here with his family in the early 1970s to escape the unrest on the streets of Belfast at the height of the Troubles.\u00a0\"My mother's from Rutland Island, which is the next island to it,\" explained Cowan. \"The Troubles had got really bad and my father thought the best way out was to buy a house on an island. That was it. We all moved [to Owey].\"\nGreen Getaways\nGreen Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.\nHaving since returned to Belfast to marry and settle with their own families, Cowan and his brother decided to take their kids on a boat trip to Owey in the early 2000s for a change of scene.\nDespite finding the island deserted, with many of the old cottages and outhouses turned to ruin after more than 25 years of neglect against the Atlantic breeze, the brothers saw the potential in the place as a peaceful escape from their busy, city lives. Along with some of their other siblings (there are 12 of them altogether) they set about fixing up the old family home and started building new houses.\nSeeing fresh life breathed into the place, other descendants of the island, who like Cowan had spent time there throughout their youth, were inspired to return and fix up the old properties in an attempt to return Owey to its former glory. Resurrecting the dilapidated houses was no easy task, however, with all supplies having to be brought over by boat. But around 20 homes are now standing, with a seasonal community of 20-30 people living here during the warmer months. There is also one hostel that sleeps up to six people (and a spot for wild camping), but no shops or other facilities.\nOwey's isolation is what attracts both locals and travellers. The seasonal community are passionate about keeping the island untouched by present-day conventions. Visitors are generally wanting to disconnect from the fast pace of life elsewhere or seeking adventure, with the rugged landscape attracting kayakers for the sea caves and rock climbers for the sea cliffs, as well as hill walkers.\nSix of our 14-strong group were staying in Owey Island Cottage Hostel, which islander Niall McGinley opens up to visitors in summer, and others were camping in the next-door-neighbour's garden.\nPlan your trip:\nWhen to go: From March to September. It's difficult to get on and off the island when the weather is harsher during autumn and winter.\nWhere to stay: Owey Island Cottage Hostel offers self-catering accommodation for up to six people during the warmer months (booking is essential). There is a gas stove but no fridge. You can also free camp on the green space beside the pier, where there is a compost toilet for public use.\nWhat to do: Hike the island hills, climb the sea cliffs with Unique Ascent, wild swim in the clifftop lake, take a guided kayaking tour of the sea caves with Selkie Sailing.\nWhere to eat: There is nowhere on the island to buy food and drink so bring all provisions with you. Cruit Island Golf Club serves food and drink in a scenic setting.\nThe hostel was once McGinley's grandmother's home and the last house on the island to be lived in, so it has weathered the decades of neglect better than most. Still retaining much of its original furniture, the cottage has two bedrooms off the main living space, where there's a gas stove, table and chairs and an open fire for everyone to gather around in the evenings. Befitting how the islanders have always lived, amenities are limited to a compost toilet in an outhouse, just a stroll away at the back of the cottage.\u00a0\nOne local, Frankie Gallagher, calls the island home because it's the birthplace of his father, and after growing up in Scotland, he now divides his time between Owey (weather permitting) and the Donegal mainland. \"Certainly we would never be looking to get electricity into the island because we can actually do well around it,\" he said.\nAlongside using gas and solar for heat, light and power, the islanders use tanks on the roof to collect rainwater. This allows Gallagher to have a gas shower in his home with the water pump running off solar. \"But it is slightly limited because there's only so much water that you can store so you have to be conscious about how long you're in the shower,\" he added.\nGallagher says this simpler lifestyle means sunsets are spectacular, with no light pollution and highly visible star constellations. He said apart from the occasional roar of a quad bike, the greatest noise pollution is from a corn crake, a rare \u2013 and noisy \u2013 bird that was once native to the island and often returns in summer.\nThe hostel is about 10 minutes on foot from where the boat docks, and after picking my bed for the night (with the help of a couple of curious free-range chickens) I sauntered down to the nearby ravine for a dip, catching the last of the sun as it glistened across the water.\nStay connected:\nDespite having no power lines, internet connection on Owey is excellent. However, there is no electricity to plug in a charger so bring a portable charger for your phone and other tech.\nThe car-free island measures just more than 300 acres in total. The southern end is grassy and fertile with a small harbour for boats to berth. Steep steps from the pier bring you to a dirt path leading to the \"village centre\" where all the homes are built on either side of a long, narrow, gurgling stream, backed by undulating hills as far as the eye can see.\nFragments of the olden days remain in the form of crumbled stone ruins, including the old schoolhouse (there was once a school, a shop and a post office on the island) alongside signs of new life, like wheelbarrows and fishing tackle interspersed among vegetable plots and flowerbeds.\u00a0\nBy contrast, the northern end of the island is exposed, rocky and barren \u2013 too rough to live on \u2013 with jagged cliffs jutting out from the sea caves that give the island its name, accompanied by vertiginous sea stacks rising majestically from crashing waves buffeted by the northern winds.\nA highlight of my trip was an adrenalin-fuelled kayaking tour of the sea caves with Selkie Sailing, a family-run business where husband and wife team, Gareth and Amanda Doherty, guide large groups across the water from Cruit Island on sit-on-top kayaks. We spent an exhilarating three hours on Saturday afternoon negotiating the waves around the rocks on the environs of the island, squeezing through soaring granite structures and meandering in and out of crevices so cinematic it was like we were extras in a movie.\nTo enjoy this unspoilt beauty in a more laid-back way, on Sunday afternoon, our group went in search of a clifftop lake, hidden amongst the rocks at the back of the island with a panoramic view of the sea. It's where one of the islanders told us they often go for a wash and a dip. To reach it, we climbed wild path north of the hostel, ascended a grassy hill that led to a plateaued cliffside and then carefully made our way down glistening pink and grey granite to discover the lagoon in all its glory.\nPlunging into shiny, black freshwater flanked by moss-covered rocks, we swam, washed and laughed \u2013 engulfed by the surreal beauty of being in a clifftop lake overlooking the ocean. I surprised myself by how relaxed I felt around people I'd only just met and a sense of peace enveloped me. We were blissfully marooned together on island time. Our roles as mums, grannies, professionals and partners were whisked away with the Atlantic wind. There was nowhere to be and nothing to rush for.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town\n\u2022\u00a0The UK's network of free hiking 'hotels'\n\u2022\u00a0Ireland's heartbreaking walk of forced emigration\n\u00a0\nOur last night on Owey was similar to the other evenings on the island: we prepared vegetables outside the cottage while the sun went down, cooked on the gas stove in candlelight and feasted on bean stew and wine around the campfire where the small group of locals \u2013 who we'd got to know over the course of the weekend \u2013 joined us for more revelry and a rapturous sing-song.\nSitting outside, watching the flames of the fire dance in the wind and listening to a group rendition of the Rare Auld Times, one of my campmates turned to me and said, \"We're winning aren't we?\".

Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.\nStill, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.\n\"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,\" she said.\nLocal health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.\n\"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,\" he said.  \"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.\nCharli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.\nUS star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.\nBut no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.\nListen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night. \nThe pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.\nReleased in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nIn the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nCritics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age. \nKnowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.\n\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.\n\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nTeddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.\nJade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all. \nAs well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.\nOver the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.\nJack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.\nAs ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.\n\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.\nLater, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".\n\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"\nSpeaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.\n\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.\n\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"\n\"I'm wearing shades because I mashed up my eye playing padel [ball],\" said Stormzy, as he accepted the prize for best rap/hip-hop artist.\n\"I've got a very sore eye. I've got a bruised cornea.\n\"My eye's sore under here, I'm not being a mad man with shades on inside.\"\nSabrina Carpenter pretended to pleasure a royal guardsman. \nCharli XCX gave a speech in a see-through top, with no bra. \nOne of Jade Thirlwall's dancers mooned at the camera. \nDanny Dyer uttered one of the English language's most offensive swear words.\nI'd guess that ITV's responses to Ofcom are going to make an interesting read.\nWord of the censor's concerns even filtered through to the arena during the show, much to Charli's annoyance.\n\"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said from the podium. I feel like we're in the era of free the nipple though, right?\"\nAs fans applauded, the singer grimaced: \"They put the clap track on, cool. Thanks for being on my side.\"\nThe Brits were set up in 1977 to celebrate the British Music Industry, and they are run by the BPI - an organisation funded by, and representing, the biggest record labels in the country.\nBut lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.\n\"Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments - because moments fade and careers take time,\" said Myles Smith. \"So please stick with artists past a viral hit.\"\nChappell Roan, who won best international artist, had a similar plea.\n\"I had to write a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones - and artists deserve that freedom, to explore horrible concepts, and to flop, and rise, and not be pressured into making music based off of what's trending.\"\nCharli XCX's multiple victories proved their point. Signed at the age of 14, she had to fight to make the music she wanted - after years of being told her songs were too abrasive and uncommercial.\n\"It feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven't made any sacrifices,\" she said.\n\"I've been doing my own thing in my own corner of the industry - and I guess, this time, culture caught up with us.\"\nMyles Smith has had an incredible 12 months. After giving up his job to pursue music, his feel-good pop anthem Stargazing went viral. So viral that it ended up as the best-selling British song of 2024.\nAsked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.\n\"And that said two things. One: This is like, the most irritating thing. But at the same time, I had made it to hold.\"\n\"Did you sing it for the operator when they picked up?\" we asked. \n\"No, I was passed to seven more people.\"\nSee? Being a pop star doesn't give you any shortcuts in the world of broadband service provider call centres.\nWhy did Jared Leto open his red carpet interview by trying to teach us an English accent?\nTo find out, you'd have to ask Jared Leto and, frankly, we're too scared.\nSabrina Carpenter was the night's biggest star - opening the show with a cheeky wink, a phalanx of bearskin-wearing guards and a vaudevillian mash-up of Espresso, Bed Chem and... er, Rule, Britannia.\nBut was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?\nThe prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).\nSix years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.\nTo be fair, the singer racked up an incredible 21 weeks at number one in the UK singles chart last year - more than anyone has ever achieved in a single calendar year - so her trophy wasn't entirely undeserved. \nA lot of viewers were left perplexed when Jack Whitehall sat down with Danny Dyer and what appeared to be his date: A woman with a horse for a face (we're not being unkind, see above for proof).\nWell, it turns out that Danny's neighbour was a German DJ who goes by the name of HorsegiirL and keeps their identity hidden behind a mask. Sort of like Deadmau5, but with fetlocks.\nMaybe next year she can come back to do a duet with Foals.\n \nEzra Collective made history by becoming the first jazz band to win the Brit Award for best group - beating previous title-holders like Coldplay, The Cure and Bring Me The Horizon.\nTaking to the stage, frontman Femi Koleoso had a few words to say about cuts to music education, and the lack of funding for youth clubs like Tomorrow's Warriors - where his band got their start.\n\"I'll bang this drum a bunch of times and I'll continue to do so until the entire country gets it\", he said.\n\"This moment right here is because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music.\n\"The reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK...  we're unsure of how to fix it, but the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies in giving a young person a saxophone.\n\"Because when you do that, you give them a dream, an aspiration and a goal.\"\nTo prove his point, he invited the London youth group Kinetika Bloco onto the stage of the O2, to blast through Ezra Collective's infectiously upbeat jazz anthem Shaking Body.\nThis year's Brit Award trophies, designed by Gabriel Moses, were cast in bronze... And they were heavy. \nWeighing 1.6kg each, you could break a toe if you dropped one. And Charli had to pick up four of the things for her winner's photo.\nIt took approximately six people to arrange them in her arms (\"don't push them between my boobs\", she squealed at one point) before she was ready for the flashbulbs.\n\"Is this lame?\" she asked at the last moment. \"It feels lame.\"\nThen she dropped them all and fell to the floor in a fit of giggles.",

        "article_text": "In one of the most exciting and dramatic awards seasons ever, the field is wide open in several fields. BBC film critics give their expert predictions for the major Academy Awards categories.\nCaryn James: It has been a fun awards season, watching the nominees for best picture pinball around. Anora became the early favourite as the brash young voice of the future, until the bonkers Emilia P\u00e9rez became the Oscar darling for a minute, then Conclave had its moment as the smart mainstream choice, until The Brutalist announced itself as the epic with artistic ambitions until... full circle, Anora is the frontrunner again. It says a lot about the strength and variety of films this year that such mayhem could happen at all. Anora \u2013 funny, original and a little bit heartbreaking \u2013 is the likely winner. And among the realistic choices (six of the nominees might as well be category filler, and Karla So\u00edia Gasc\u00f3n's unearthed offensive tweets shattered Emilia's chances), Anora should win. But lurking in the background is Conclave, which could win by consensus, given that voters rank their choices in this category. Simplistic scenario: votes for the top film are so scattered that Conclave finally gets the most votes because it's everybody's second choice. Plus, it really is a satisfying political thriller that happens to be set in the Vatican, and its Bafta and SAG awards are a sign of real support. In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.\nNicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. This year, things aren't so simple. What we can say, judging by all the other awards ceremonies that have been and gone this year, is that Dune: Part Two, Emilia P\u00e9rez, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys, The Substance and Wicked are vanishingly unlikely to take home the biggest prize of the night. None of them has whipped up the enthusiasm that's required from both the public and the critics. That leaves us with Anora, The Brutalist, A Complete Unknown and Conclave \u2013 and over the last few weeks I've wavered between all four of them as the most likely best picture winner. As I write, Anora seems to be the favourite, and I can understand why. It's a film about contemporary American life made by an American auteur, and it balances uncompromising grittiness with exuberant, crowd-pleasing flair. In a year when arguments could be made for and against so many contenders, Anora has come to feel like the choice that could please everyone, so it may well complete the journey it began when it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0This is a strong category, but I doubt that the Academy's voters will go for a French director who was largely unknown in the US before she made\u00a0The Substance, so Coralie Fargeat is out. The various Emilia P\u00e9rez backlashes have hurt Jacques Audiard's chances, and A Complete Unknown hasn't received much praise for its directing as such, so James Mangold is a long shot, too. That means that the best director Oscar will either go to Sean Baker, for the verve and naturalism he brings to Anora, or to Brady Corbet, for the valiant artistic vision of The Brutalist. But the amiable Baker has made several excellent films that haven't garnered many awards, including Tangerine and The Florida Project, so I suspect that he will be the Academy's choice.\nCaryn James: This race comes down to a stark contrast, between Sean Baker, whose Anora is a beautifully orchestrated contemporary romp, and Brady Corbet, whose The Brutalist wilfully announces its ambition as the kind of film they don't make anymore, an historical epic complete with intermission. It's a good guess that Baker is likely to triumph, because he won the Directors Guild Award and the film won the Producers Guild award, two major predictors of the Oscars. And he should win. He made Anora feel effortless, but beneath that apparent ease is some masterful work, as he navigates the changes in tone \u2013 from fairy tale to screwball comedy to drama \u2013 that make the film so rich. Coralie Fargeat deserves her place here for her confident direction of The Substance, but it's really a two-man race.\nCaryn James: Adrian Brody was on his way to making this a done deal, having won every major precursor from the Golden Globe to the Bafta, until Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet got in his way by winning the SAG award for A Complete Unknown. Oscar voting had ended by the time Chalamet won, but as an indicator of how the votes go, SAG has a great track record. You can never underestimate Oscar voters' affection for a biopic, and Chalamet's take on Bob Dylan was a true embodiment of a character as well as a spot-on impersonation. But Brody is still very likely to win, and he should, for his searing performance as a Holocaust refugee. He creates a portrait of a man who is talented and ambitious, sometimes ruthless and sometimes vulnerable, and fully human. But let's acknowledge how strong the category is this year, the rare case where it would be perfectly appropriate for Ralph Fiennes, Colman Domingo or Sebastian Stan to win too.\nNicholas Barber: Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (A Complete Unknown) are neck and neck, so it's tricky to say which attributes will tempt the Academy more. Will it be pain, anguish and a Hungarian accent, or a nifty impersonation elevated by some expert singing and guitar-picking? Will it be the long-awaited return to greatness of a Hollywood stalwart who has already won an Oscar, or the crowning of a fresh-faced youngster who has nonetheless amassed a tremendous body of work? It could go either way, but Chalamet's Oscar campaigning has been flawless \u2013 he has shown himself to be fun-loving and self-mocking, but at recent awards ceremonies, including Sunday's SAG Awards, he has emphasised how seriously he takes a difficult job \u2013 so I'm betting on him. My own personal favourite is the wonderfully versatile Ralph Fiennes, who is so quiet and reserved yet so racked by doubt in Conclave \u2013 but I doubt that this is his year.\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here. Both Moore and Torres won Golden Globes for their roles, in a musical / comedy and in a drama respectively, and for most of the time since then, they've been the frontrunners. Madison shook things up when she won the Bafta, so it's now the closest of calls. But I reckon that Moore will win. Partly, that's because of her savagely self-parodying performance as a former A-list star being turned into a monster by the ageist entertainment industry. And partly it's because her comeback narrative, as spelt out in her Golden Globes acceptance speech, would furnish the Academy with the kind of feelgood story it loves so much.\nCaryn James: Demi Moore has been on an almost steady march toward her first Oscar, marred only by Mikey Madison's Bafta, ever since her pitch-perfect campaign/acceptance speech on winning the Golden Globe for The Substance. Moore checks all the boxes: the story of how Hollywood finally takes her seriously, the insider status and the no-holds-barred performance in a film with a resonant message. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win. Torres gives a beautifully nuanced, restrained performance in\u00a0I'm Still Here\u00a0as a grieving yet determined widow during Brazil's political dictatorship. But Oscars tend to go to screaming, yelling, tearing-down-the-scenery roles, which is what The Substance and Anora call for. A brilliantly subtle performance like Torres's has an uphill battle.\nCaryn James: There's a reason Kieran Culkin has won every major award in this category in the run-up to the Oscars: he really deserves to. His wilfully outrageous, sad and moving character of Benji in A Real Pain may have echoes of his role as Roman Roy in Succession, but it is also funny and affecting on its own, a delicate mix of comedy and tragedy. And it hasn't hurt his chances that every acceptance speech of his is wry, self-deprecating and fun to watch. Some winners make an earnest point of saying \"There is no winner\" or spreading the praise around, but Culkin has turned acceptances into a stand-up art form. In another year, Edward Norton might have taken the award for his sharply drawn performance as Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, but that seems like a very unlikely upset.\nNicholas Barber: This year's Oscars are harder to predict than usual, but the best supporting actor category is the exception that proves the rule. Ever since Kieran Culkin won the Golden Globe for his role in A Real Pain in January, he has kept on winning and winning \u2013 and now it feels as if there is no point in any of his competitors turning up to the ceremony at all. Even those of us who would argue that Culkin isn't really a supporting actor in the film, but a co-lead with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg, have had to accept the inevitable. The only regrettable part of the whole business is that this category is stacked with Oscar-worthy performances, namely Yura Borisov's soft-hearted Russian muscle in Anora, Edward Norton's gentle Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce's bluff tycoon in The Brutalist, and Culkin's old Succession co-star Jeremy Strong as controversial lawyer Roy Cohn in The Apprentice. If they hadn't been up against Culkin, any one of them might have won.\nNicholas Barber: For a while it looked as if Zoe Salda\u00f1a had this Oscar in the bag. Of course,\u00a0she isn't really a supporting actress\u00a0in Emilia P\u00e9rez, but one of the leads. As soon as voters put her in this category, though, it seemed to be hers for the taking. Not only does she deliver a fabulous performance that includes energetic song-and-dance numbers, but she is a mainstay of the Marvel and Star Trek cinematic universes, so she has helped Hollywood make zillions of dollars. Then a journalist uncovered Those Social Media Posts. The bigoted remarks made by the other star of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, stripped the film of much of its goodwill, and Salda\u00f1a's hopes were badly damaged in the explosion of recriminations. Oscars observers started wondering: Would Ariana Grande win for Wicked, instead? It's still possible, but Saldana has distanced herself smartly from the scandal, and made emotional speeches at other award ceremonies, including the Baftas and the SAG Awards, so the Academy will probably reward her for her work, rather than punish her for her co-star's opinions.\nCaryn James: Zoe Salda\u00f1a may be the one person to escape unscathed from the Emilia P\u00e9rez debacle, and get the Oscar, as she should. She has won every precursor award, and is actually the dynamic centre of the story. Rita, the lawyer who helps the title character to transition and create a new identity, gives Salda\u00f1a her richest role yet and she makes the most of it. Rita starts as a fiery, beleaguered small-town lawyer, wrestles with her conscience about being involved with a criminal, and eventually becomes a philanthropist, and Salda\u00f1a sings and dances her way through it all with grace and presence. And she had the perfectly crafted answer when first asked about her co-star's offensive tweets, saying she was \"saddened\". Very well played. Isabella Rossellini makes a huge impact as Sister Agnes in a small role in Conclave, and Monica Barbaro is amazing as she channels Joan Baez in A Complete Unknown, but they can't complete with Salda\u00f1a's Rita.\nCaryn James: Peter Straughan is sure to win for Conclave. He turns Robert Harris's potboiler novel into a sleek, thoughtful screenplay, which is a huge part of what makes the film \u2013 pretty talky when you think about it, and not exactly an action movie \u2013 so suspenseful and entertaining. Turning that straightforward novel into a faithful screenplay may sound simple, but in fact Straughn's adaptation has a magician's deft touch, taking the best of the story and making it much better. It's great to see that RaMell Ross and Joslyn Barnes's screenplay for Ross's Nickel Boys is nominated. It's a dazzling adaptation of Colson Whitehead's extremely literary novel, but the film hasn't received the kind of major awards traction it would need to compete. The rest of the category is fairly weak. The screenplay is the least of Emilia P\u00e9rez, Sing Sing is less about script than performance. And the banal screenplay for the biopic A Complete Unknown shouldn't even have a place in this conversation.\nNicholas Barber: Peter Straughan's gripping adaptation of Robert Harris's novel, Conclave, has picked up prizes at the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice awards, and the Baftas. And when Conclave won best picture at the Baftas, the film's director, Edward Berger, made a point of singing Straughan's praises. Is he unbeatable at this stage? The controversies swirling around Emilia P\u00e9rez may have put it out of the running \u2013 as adventurous as Jacques Audiard's screenplay is \u2013 and there doesn't seem to be much chatter about A Complete Unknown, Nickel Boys and Sing Sing in this category. So, yes, unless there are some Conclave-style shenanigans going on behind closed doors, Straughan should triumph here.\nNicholas Barber: This is one of this year's toughest categories to predict. September 5 hasn't built any momentum over awards season, but the other four best screenplay nominees \u2013 Anora, The Brutalist, A Real Pain, The Substance \u2013 are all brilliant in their own distinctive ways, and were all written or co-written by the films' directors. Sean Baker's Anora script won at the WGA Awards; Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold's The Brutalist was given the prize by two US critics' organisations; Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain won at the Baftas, and Coralie Fargeat's The Substance won at Cannes last year. My own preference, in a year of extremely long films, is Eisenberg's precision-engineered screenplay for A Real Pain, because it doesn't waste a scene, or a syllable of dialogue, in a trim 90 minutes. But I think that Anora will beat it, which would be OK by me, too.\nCaryn James: This is one of the richest categories, with three very different, thoroughly deserving nominees. Sean Baker's Anora is fresh and bold. Coralie Fargeat's The Substance is audacious and zeitgeisty. And Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain is perceptive and humane to its core. Anora and The Substance were also nominated for best picture, a sign of strength that might give them an edge. But I'm guessing that A Real Pain, which should win, will come through in the end. Where Anora and especially The Substance owe a lot to those films' initial concepts, Eisenberg's screenplay is the work of a writer with an ear for making his dialogue both believable and affecting. Of course, Anora is coming on so strong in other categories, you can't possibly rule it out, but if voters want to spread the awards around they may see this as a chance to give A Real Pain some well-earned recognition.\u00a0\nCaryn James: Once, this race seemed down to Emilia P\u00e9rez v I'm Still Here, but Emilia's implosion clears the way for I'm Still Here, which will win now and always should have. Walter Salles's brilliantly moving story of a family dealing with the aftermath of their father's disappearance during the Brazilian dictatorship in the 1970s is an eloquent, timely masterpiece that reveals the personal cost of politics. The film is nominated for best picture, which it surely won't win, and Fernanda Torres for actress, where winning would be an upset, but those nominations are a sign of strength that will translate into winning the International prize. There isn't a weak film in this category, with The Seed of the Sacred Fig another standout, but I'm Still Here towers above the others. There were celebrations in Brazil at the nominations alone, and although Brazilian films have been nominated before, including Salles's 1998 Central Station, it looks like the celebrations will go on for the country's first Oscar in this category.\nNicholas Barber: A storm of bad publicity knocked Emilia P\u00e9rez off-course this awards season, and suddenly it seemed as if one of its competitors might grab the Oscar for best international film. The most likely of these would be I'm Still Here, a powerful and popular Brazilian political drama whose star, Fernanda Torres, has been nominated for best actress. Also in with a chance are Flow, a Latvian cartoon which is nominated for best animated feature film, and The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which was made in secret in Iran by Mohammad Rasoulof, and then smuggled out of the country. But a week is a long time in awards season, and the Oscars take place a whole month after Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n's offensive tweets were unearthed. My hunch is that the storm is passing, and that Emilia P\u00e9rez, which won the equivalent prize at the Baftas, will get its Oscar, after all.\nNicholas Barber: Nineteen years ago, Nick Park (and his co-director) won the Oscar for Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Nine years ago, the Oscar went to Pixar's Inside Out. Follow-ups to both films are nominated this year, and as this is one category in which voters aren't averse to handing prizes to sequels, either of them could win. Things are looking especially promising for Aardman's claymation caper, Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl, a favourite of mine which nabbed not one but two Baftas \u2013 one for animated feature film and one for children's / family film. The dialogue-free Latvian charmer, Flow, has its cheerleaders, too, whereas Memoir of a Snail, an Australian stop-motion animation, is just too gloomy to get voters behind it. That leaves the nominee which I believe will win: The Wild Robot. It's a sci-fi epic, yet it has a big heart and loveable picture-book visuals. Besides, its writer-director, Chris Sanders, made Lilo & Stitch, The Croods, and How to Train Your Dragon, but has never won an Oscar. Surely his peers will want to rectify that this year?\nCaryn James: How important is box office? That may be the deciding factor in this race, which is between two eco-themed films: The Wild Robot, the frontrunner, and Flow, its only likely competition. Flow is a true original, a dialogue-free Latvian film about a cat who tries to survive a flood. The Wild Robot is a funny, heart-tugging story about an intelligent robot, voiced by Lupita Nyong'o, who grows a human heart after being stranded on an island full of animal creatures facing an environmental crisis of its own. The Wild Robot has starry voices, including Pedro Pascal as Fink the Fox and Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, and it has earned more than $300m. In itself that might not be enough to get the Oscar, but the combination of star power, a timely message and its popularity with audiences is likely to make it the winner. And it is charming, so fair enough. The attention to Flow so far might be its best reward.\nCaryn James: There are years when documentaries with urgent political messages become the undeniable frontrunners and inevitable winners, such as Navalny in 2023 and 20 Days in Mariupol last year. This is one of those years. The extraordinary No Other Land will win and it should. Its eye-opening first-hand look at a village in the West Bank from 2019 to 2023, when Israeli forces destroyed homes and displaced the villagers, makes the cost of the conflict visceral. The film's backstory is compelling: it was made by a team of Israelis and two Palestinians, whose personal stories shape the film. And it resonates with even more impact since the turmoil in the Middle East continues. The film has not found a US distributor despite earning awards from several festival and critics' groups. but it has done very well in self-distribution. A vote for it might even convince the Hollywood players who have the power to release it wider.\nNicholas Barber: The past two winners of the Oscar for best documentary feature were 20 Days in Mariupol, which celebrated the resilience of the Ukrainian people during the current war, and Navalny, which condemned Vladimir Putin's regime. That trend could well continue this year, at a time when those inter-related topics are more urgent than ever, with the prize going to Porcelain War. Brendan Bellomo and Slava Leontyev's film offers an intense, citizen's-eye view of the conflict in Ukraine, and shows civilians being trained as combatants. What separates it from other such documentaries is that the main participants, Leontyev and his wife Anya Stasenko, are artists who sculpt and paint exquisitely patterned porcelain animals. The theme is the importance of storytelling and creativity as ways to resist oppression \u2013 and what could be more appealing to Hollywood's film-making community than that?\nNicholas Barber:\u00a0If voters feel that a film as lucrative as Wicked shouldn't go away empty-handed, then giving it the prize for best original score is one obvious way for them to show it some love. But my money is on Daniel Blumberg's awe-inspiring score for The Brutalist, which won the Bafta in the same category. One of the questions raised by Brady Corbet's film is how such a low-budget indie drama can seem so epic, and the music has a lot to do with it. It's big, bold and experimental, with strange ticking and clinking noises to establish the theme of construction, stately motifs to echo the characters' grand ambitions, and some symphonic bombast and wild jazz to convey the thrill of arriving in the US in the middle of the 20th Century. It's also deeply eerie at times, so you can expect it to be used on trailers for horror films and science-fiction sagas for years to come.\nCaryn James: It might seem like Emilia P\u00e9rez and Wicked have the edge, but the songs that pop out of these musicals have their own category. Here, the award for the background music is between Conclave's Volker Bertelmann, who won the Oscar for his music in\u00a0All Quiet on the Western Front\u00a0(like Conclave, directed by Edward Berger), or Daniel Blumberg, who won this year's Bafta for his score for The Brutalist. Both scores serve their films well. Bertelmann's classical style adds suspense to the Vatican thriller. But I'd give the edge to Blumberg, who should win for his evocative score that adds a touch of the contemporary to the film's post-World War Two setting. Sometimes jazz-infused, sometimes commanding, his score enhances the mood without thwacking viewers over the head.\nCaryn James: The film that should win wasn't even nominated. It's still a head-scratcher why Jomo Fray's eloquent, imaginative cinematography for Nickel Boys, which gracefully meshed with director RaMell Ross's first-person narrative, wasn't acknowledged, while the film got a best picture nod. But there are two very strong contenders among the nominees. The Brutalist, shot in old-style, widescreen, rarely used VistaVision, has epic sweep, and is full of clarity. And Nosferatu's cinematography is a beautiful mix of colour in its scenes of daily life, and darkness in the shadowy world of the vampire. Jarin Blaschke, who has worked on previous, stunning Robert Eggers's films, equals that work in Nosferatu and should win. But The Brutalist and Lol Crawley probably will, if only because the film has been so much in the awards conversation, while Nosferatu definitely hasn't.\nNicholas Barber: The fact that Nickel Boys didn't get onto the shortlist for its immersive first-person camerawork is one of the Oscars' most puzzling oversights this year, and it's a shame, too, that the stylish Conclave was ignored. Of the films that were nominated, Nosferatu boasts glorious mountain vistas and shadowy Victorian chambers, while The Brutalist has the geeky appeal of large-format VistaVision film stock. But I have a feeling that the Academy will honour Greig Fraser's stunning views of uncanny alien worlds in Dune: Part Two. After all, voters have to give at least something to bona-fide Hollywood blockbusters, and this would be a worthwhile way for them to do so.\n--\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

Sean Baker's Anora script won at the WGA Awards; Brady Corbet and Mona Fastvold's The Brutalist was given the prize by two US critics' organisations; Jesse Eisenberg's A Real Pain won at the Baftas, and Coralie Fargeat's The Substance won at Cannes last year. In a year that has had so many frontrunners, a Conclave win is entirely plausible.Nicholas Barber: This time last year, Oppenheimer was firm favourite to win the Oscar for best picture \u2013 and plenty more besides. She is still the likely winner, but there could be an upset from Madison for her star-making role in Anora, or by Fernanda Torres, who should win. Best actressNicholas Barber:\u00a0OK, so we know that Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n isn't going to win \u2013 the publicising of her offensive X posts settled that \u2013 so that leaves us with Cynthia Erivo for Wicked, Mikey Madison for Anora, Demi Moore for The Substance and Fernanda Torres for I'm Still Here.",

If so, in these increasingly transactional times, what does Romania get in return? Or was this more like a pre-emptive gesture of good will towards the American president, a gift to lay at Donald Trump's imperious feet?\nOr are we searching for conspiracies when the truth is probably far more chaotic?\nAs foreign leaders \u2013 from Volodymyr Zelensky to Sir Keir Starmer \u2013 travel to Washington DC bearing deals and other apparent peace offerings, one might ask who could blame Romania, a staunch NATO ally navigating a host of internal and external challenges, for trying to keep an increasingly unpredictable US administration on side?\n\"It's a matter of life (or death) for Romania,\" said security analyst George Scutaru, describing his country's need to shore up Western support in the face of growing pressure from the Kremlin. \nDeclining to comment on the Tate issue specifically, Scutaru said it was clear Moscow was seeking to undermine Romania's democracy and that the government had good reason to seek ways to remind the Trump administration of the many advantages \u2013 commercial, diplomatic, and military \u2013 of continuing to back it.\nBut if the Tate brothers are part of that equation, it is already clear that many Romanians are not impressed.\nThis is a country already facing a strong populist backlash against an elite ruling class that is widely seen as corrupt and out of touch with the struggles of ordinary people who feel treated as second-class citizens \u2013 a mere source of cheap labour - within the European Union.\nSo, the sight of the Tates appearing to receive special treatment plays into the notion that Romania's institutions are hollow and cater only to those with money.\n\"For me, what has happened is unacceptable. We cannot allow Romania's image to be tarnished by impunity and defiance,\" fumed Elena Lasconi, a prominent presidential candidate here, expressing deep concern that Romanian prosecutors' sudden decision to relax the Tates' travel restrictions was the result of \"external influence.\"\n\"It's my personal perception that probably there is\u2026 pressure on the Romanian political system, as logically the prosecutor would have applied very strict rules to control (the Tates) and probably the United States would have been a place where they would be allowed to travel (due to concerns they would not be extradited if they failed to return),\" said  international human rights lawyer, Silvia Tabusca.\nIt is beyond doubt that Andrew Tate's lucrative brand of assertive masculinity has earned him allies in President Trump's administration. One of his former lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, now works in the White House. \nMany in the so-called \"manosphere\" see Tate as a persecuted hero who has just been rescued from Romania's corrupt clutches.\nThere is also a more nebulous far-right alignment between some pro-Trump and pro-Tate figures in the US, far-right and allegedly pro-Russian forces in Romania, and the Kremlin itself, which stands accused of plotting to weaken Bucharest's pro-western stance.\nBut the picture is not clear cut.\nPresident Trump distanced himself from the brothers' case on Thursday and there are signs of a broader push-back in the US, with the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis making it clear the Tates are \"not welcome\" in his state, amid plans to open a \"preliminary inquiry\" into allegations against them of human trafficking and violence against women.\nMeanwhile in Bucharest, the theory that Romania's government cut a deal with the US to release the brothers is treated with caution by some analysts.\n\"I think the chances (of such a deal) are fifty-fifty,\" said Sorin Ionita, a political commentator, questioning the ability of Romania's various institutions and ministries to arrange a \"coherent\" policy concerning the Tates.\n\"I'm not sure they coordinate. Did they manage to demand something in exchange (from the US)? I'm not sure,\" said Ionita, bemoaning a situation almost designed to persuade Romania's public to lose faith in state institutions, and speculating that lower level \"satellite\" figures in an equally chaotic Trump administration were probably behind any deal in order \"to extract money from the Tate brothers.\" The BBC has seen no evidence of this.\n\"It's very depressing to see,\" he added.\nAs for the question of whether the Tates will return to Romania, as their lawyer has promised, to continue their legal battles, a degree of uncertainty endures.\nThe fact that most of their assets have been unfrozen could be seen as weakening the Romanian authorities' ability to compel them to come back. The Tates themselves have also questioned whether they can receive a fair trial in Romania, complaining of a \"conspiracy\" against them.\nAnd while Andrew Tate pointed out on Thursday that he and his brother currently face \"no active indictment\" in Romania, a more accurate way of describing their situation might be to say there is currently a lull in a long and complex legal process. An initial case has been returned to prosecutors for amendments, while a second and more substantial prosecution case against them is now pending.\n\"In the second case, we have 34 victims that cooperate and have been identified as victims. Among them are two minors, one a 17-year-old girl that has been recruited in order to be exploited by the criminal group. And the second girl is 15-years-old, and there is a crime for sexual acts with a minor in which they are also involved,\" said the lawyer, Silvia Tabusca, outlining the allegations in the second case. \nThe brothers also face arrest on separate and unrelated criminal charges in the UK. The Tates deny any wrongdoing in all these cases.\nIn the coming months, Romania faces far more pressing challenges than the fate of two foreign celebrities. Presidential elections have been rescheduled for May and a leading candidate \u2013 often accused of being a Kremlin puppet - has just been detained and is facing six criminal charges including fascism and undermining the constitutional order.\nWith their self-declared misogyny, extreme views, and online personas, Andrew and Tristan Tate do chime with some of the themes preoccupying and dividing society in America and far beyond. \nClearly, they remain influential figures, particularly among boys and young men. But the brothers face years of legal battles which may well push them, and their still lucrative brand, further to the periphery of the far larger dramas now reshaping our world.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nButtler on 'right time for me' to leave England captaincy\nThe end came quicker than anyone expected.\nJust six months ago England coach Brendon McCullum backed Jos Buttler to the hilt despite questions over his captain's future.\nEven after defeat by Afghanistan, most thought the decision would be made after the flight home. Instead, Buttler resigned with a smile, his mate by his side, leaving McCullum searching for a new lieutenant.\nEngland's fall from the white-ball summit has been stark and there are issues aplenty to face...\n'Last rites and alarm bells drown out England's good vibes'\nEngland bowler Wood may need knee surgery\nThe first is the most obvious - finding Buttler's replacement.\nHarry Brook is the overwhelming favourite given he is the current deputy, impressed when standing in for the five-match one-day international series against Australia last September and is regularly praised by coaches and team-mates for his smart 'cricket brain'.\nBut appointing the 26-year-old would bring its own challenges.\nThere is less crossover ahead in England's multi-format schedule, but playing every white-ball match and being a Test regular would require Keely Hodgkinson's stamina.\nMcCullum has already accepted he will have to miss tours, having taken charge of the Test and limited-overs sides. If Brook were named skipper, he would surely have to do the same.\nThe alternative is turning to a white-ball specialist, but Adil Rashid, 37, is too old and Liam Livingstone and Phil Salt too insecure in the XI. Sam Curran has Indian Premier League captaincy experience, but is currently out of the side.\nRecalling a specialist captain like James Vince or Sam Billings is surely a non-starter.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nBoth Buttler and McCullum were keen to stress the resignation is not the end of the 34-year-old's England career.\n\"I'm sure we will look at ways that we can get the best out of him in terms of his role, so he can have maximum impact as well,\" said the former Black Caps skipper.\nYet Buttler the batter is in need of reinvigoration. He has scored only two 50s in ODIs since September 2023, but an example to follow is not hard to find.\n\"Hopefully now I can follow Joe Root's lead and play like he has since he relinquished the captaincy,\" Buttler said of his team-mate, who gave up the Test job and scored centuries in three of his next four Tests.\nButtler cannot continue as a non-captaining, non-bowling number six in the modern game, meaning some imagination is required.\nMcCullum and Buttler created a new role for Jamie Smith in this tournament - a powerplay-attacking number three that has resulted in Smith twice being dismissed cheaply by poor shots.\nPerhaps, a revitalised Buttler is actually the ideal man for that.\nThis one is English cricket's long-standing problem.\nWhen England focus on the Test side, the white-ball team struggles. When they give priority to those in a coloured kit, the red-ball side lurches towards review-inducing crisis.\nThat Buttler has rarely had his best players available is the caveat that should go down alongside a tournament record that reads one title and three sorry exits.\nMcCullum's first act as white-ball leader has been to bring the two sides closer together. Smith, Ben Duckett, Brydon Carse and Gus Atkinson are all Test players given limited-overs opportunities. The results cannot be deemed a success.\nEngland will play only 10 Tests this year, having played 17 in 2024, and McCullum does not sound ready for change.\n\"Most other teams manage that, if you look at India's players and how they play cross-formats, look at Australia's fast bowling line-up, New Zealand are similar,\" he said.\n\"I'm hopeful that with some shrewd planning and a better understanding of what our player pool looks like, we'll be able to make sure we can get it across all formats, because that's ultimately what people that follow this team deserves.\"\nThe damage caused by England's Champions Trophy campaign may not be consigned to three matches in eight days in Pakistan.\nMark Wood's knee injury could yet have serious consequences for their quest to regain the Ashes this winter.\nIf, as feared, he requires surgery, there have to be genuine concerns about how well the fast bowler can recover from going under the knife again aged 35.\nWood was picked for this tournament as part the current set-up's pace obsession.\nThat he, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood - all capable of bowling at least 88mph - were picked is part of McCullum's plan to make fast bowling one of the USPs of English cricket. Again, this plan has not worked here.\nMcCullum will have half an eye on the next 50-over World Cup in southern Africa where fast, bouncy pitches should suit the ploy, but a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka comes before then.\nWho is the new-ball metronome to be the TikTok generation's Chris Woakes? Who will take middle-over wickets like Liam Plunkett or offer support to Archer at the death?\nAnd spinner Rashid's replacement looks as far away as ever\u2026\nThat takes us to another issue that continues to disadvantage England. They have to find a generation of 50-over cricketers from a pool who are not playing the format.\nThe Hundred is not going anywhere. England need to find a solution to the problems it has caused rather than just throw their arms into the air.\nThe main issue is not giving youngsters a taste of 50-over cricket - the One-Day Cup will continue to do that while it is played as a development competition alongside The Hundred - but instead ensuring the talents spotted have enough competitive, challenging cricket to aid their progression afterwards.\nThis is where the Lions programme will be crucial.\nJacob Bethell, Jordan Cox, Tom Hartley and Carse all played in the Lions' last ODI in February 2023 and have gone on to varying degrees of success on the international stage.\nAnother solution would be to move the One-Day Cup and give England an advantage over their rivals.\nNo nation's players are currently playing a good amount of domestic one-day cricket.

        "article_text": "A plane crash in South Korea last December left Park Geun-woo an orphan. The 22-year-old had barely found space to mourn his parents when he came across a torrent of online abuse, conspiracies and malicious jokes made about the victims.\nThe Jeju Air plane, which was returning from Bangkok, Thailand, crash-landed at Muan International Airport on 29 December and exploded after slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of the runway, killing 179 of the 181 people on board.\nPolice investigations have identified and apprehended eight people who have been accused of making derogatory and defamatory online posts. These included suggestions that families were \"thrilled\" to receive compensation from authorities, or that they were \"fake victims\" - to the extent that some felt compelled to prove they had lost their loved ones.\nAuthorities have taken down at least 427 such posts.\nBut this is not the first time that bereaved families in South Korea have found themselves the targets of online abuse. Speaking to the BBC, experts described a culture where economic struggles, financial envy and social issues such as toxic competitiveness are fuelling hate speech.\nFollowing Seoul's Halloween crowd crush in 2022, victims and bereaved families were similarly smeared. A man who lost his son in the incident had his photo doctored by hate groups - showing him laughing after receiving compensation. \nPeople whose loved ones died in the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014 - a maritime disaster that saw 304 people killed, mostly schoolchildren - have also for years been the targets of hate speech. \nThe tragedy saw the government pay out an average of 420 million won ($292,840; \u00a3231,686) per victim - triggering comments that claimed this figure was unreasonably high. \n\"People who are living day by day feel the compensation is overrated and say the bereaved are getting 'unfair treatment' and that they are making a big deal when everyone's life is hard,\" Koo Jeong-woo, a sociology professor at Sungkyunkwan University, told news site The Korea Herald. \nIn later comments to the BBC, Prof Koo suggested that economic stress and a competitive job market - particularly in the wake of Covid - has left many people feeling socially isolated, exacerbating the issue of hate speech.\nMany South Koreans, he says, now \"view others not as their peers, but as adversaries\", pointing to a widespread culture of comparison in South Korea.\n\"We tend to compare a lot... if you put someone else down, it's easier to feel superior yourself,\" he told the BBC. \"That's why there's a bit of tendency in Korea to engage in hate speech or make derogatory remarks, aiming to diminish others to elevate oneself.\"\nMr Park says the families of the Jeju Air crash victims have been characterised as \"parasites squandering the nation's money\".\nBy way of example, he refers to a recent article about an emergency relief fund of three million won ($2,055; \u00a31,632) that was raised for the bereaved through donations. That article was met with a flood of malicious comments, many referencing the erroneous suggestion that taxpayers' money was used for the fund.\n\"It seems like the families of the Muan Airport victims have hit the jackpot. They must be secretly delighted,\" said one such comment. \nMr Park says these comments were \"overwhelming\".\n\"Even if compensation for the accident comes in, how could we possibly feel like recklessly spending it when it is the price of our loved ones' lives?\" he says. \"Every single one of those comments cuts us deeply. We're not here to make money.\"\n\"Too many people, instead of being sensitive, build their entertainment on others' suffering,\" he adds. \"When something like this happens, they belittle it and spew hateful remarks.\"\nJoshua Uyheng, a psychology professor in the Philippines who studies online hate,  says that hate is often \"directed towards [those] we believe are gaining some advantage at our expense\". \n\"We feel hatred when we [think we] are getting the short end of the stick.\"\nIn the case of the Jeju Air crash, political dynamics only made things worse.\nThe accident came amid a period of political turmoil in South Korea, with the country reeling from suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's shock decision to enact martial law - an incident that politically divided the country.\nMany supporters of President Yoon's right-wing People Power Party have, without evidence, pinned blame for the crash on the main opposition Democratic Party (DP), pointing to the fact that Muan Airport was originally built as part of a political pledge by the DP.\n\"The Muan airport tragedy is a man-made disaster caused by the DP,\" read one comment on YouTube. Another described it as \"100% the fault\" of the party.\nPark Han-shin, whose brother died in the plane crash, says he has been accused of being a DP member and \"fake bereaved family member\". So extensive were these claims that his daughter took to social media to call them out.\n\"It pains me deeply to see my father, who lost his brother in such a tragedy, being labelled a 'scammer'. It also makes me worried that this misinformation might lead my father to make wrong choices out of despair,\" she wrote on Threads two days after the incident.\nPark Han-shin says he is stunned by how people seem to \"enjoy taking advantage of others' pain\".\n\"That's simply not something a human being should do,\" he told the BBC. \n\"I am just an ordinary citizen. I am not here to enter politics. I came to find out the truth about my younger brother's death.\"\nWhile there are no perfect solutions to hate, experts say social media companies should establish policies on what constitutes hate speech and moderate content posted on their platforms accordingly.\n\"Online users should be able to report malicious posts and comments smoothly, and platform companies must actively delete such content,\" Prof Koo says. Law enforcement agencies should also take perpetrators to task, he adds.\nReminding people of their shared identities may also help, says Prof Uyheng.\n\"The less people feel that they are on opposite ends of a zero-sum game, perhaps the more they can feel that tragedies like these are the shared concern of us all - and that victims deserve empathy and compassion, not vitriol and condemnation.\"",

Later that day, his body was found at the foot of a cliff by an off-duty policeman on a waterbike.\nLee does not believe Nathan made the journey to the remote location in the opposite direction to his hotel on his own, and said it would take an hour to walk up there. \nHe added Nathan had \"no reason to be up there\". \n\"We strongly believe he was taken up there, whether it was by taxi or against his own will,\" Lee said. \"And something has happened for him to be found where he was found.\"\nThe family said the day after his death attempts were made to use Nathan's bank cards, but this was not followed up by the authorities.\nAlannah and Lee have also been tracing Nathan's known movements on the night. They said he had been on a video call with one of his friends until his phone battery ran out.\nCarrying out their own investigations, the family discovered Nathan on public CCTV on the promenade, where they said he did not appear significantly intoxicated. They have found other premises with CCTV, but said the owners would not pass on any recordings without a request from the Spanish authorities. \nThe family said they had repeatedly tried to find out how the investigation into Nathan's death was progressing, but have been met with silence.\nThey recently received a police file which Alannah said was \"empty\", with the case described as closed.\nNathan's mother Elizabeth said there was \"no empathy\" from the Spanish police immediately after his death and claimed they were \"treated like dogs\". \nElizabeth said she had to identify her son by being shown a photo of a tattoo on his torso.\nShe said not knowing how he ended up at the remote location is torturous.\n\"Our boy deserves answers and we as a family deserve answers. Nathan wasn't a drunkard who'd go out and forget about everything. Nathan was really with it,\" she said.\n\"Not knowing about that last hour or two before his death, it's eating us away, day in day out, from the time we get up to the time we go to bed. We live this nightmare.\"\nNathan's father Jonathan said: \"They've done nothing, nothing at all. It's just a total disregard for his life in every kind of way.\"\nThe family said they needed to travel to Benidorm because of their frustration and to hand police the information they have gathered about the time between Nathan leaving his friends and the discovery of his body.\nThe Spanish authorities have agreed to meet them and discuss their concerns.\nLee said the family will not give up in its quest to find out what happened.\n\"We'll keep going and going until we find out why - and how he got up there,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office said: \"We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Spain and are in contact with the local authorities.\"",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Hamas was refusing to accept a temporary extension proposed by Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff.\nA Hamas spokesman said blocking supplies to Gaza was \"cheap blackmail\" and a \"coup\" on the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to intervene.\nThe ceasefire deal halted 15 months of fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military, allowing the release of 33 Israeli hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.\nThe internationally-mediated ceasefire plan - originally proposed by Joe Biden - envisages three stages. \nThe first phase came into force on 19 January and expired on Saturday.\nNegotiations on phase two, meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, were due to have started weeks ago, but have barely begun.\nPhase three is meant to result in the return of all remaining bodies of dead hostages and the reconstruction of Gaza, which is expected to take years. \nHamas has previously said it will not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from the mediators that phase two would eventually take place.\nAs the first phase of the deal expired on Saturday, Netanyahu's office said Israel had agreed to Witkoff's proposal for the ceasefire to continue for about six weeks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Jewish Passover periods. \nIf, at the end of this period, negotiations reached a dead end, Israel would reserve the right to go back to war.\nWitkoff has not made his proposal public. According to Israel, it would begin with the release of half of all the remaining living and dead hostages.\nWitkoff is said by Israel to have proposed the temporary extension after becoming convinced that more time was needed to try to bridge the differences between Israel and Hamas on conditions for ending the war.\nA statement from Netanyahu's office said: \"With the end of Phase 1 of the hostage deal, and in light of Hamas's refusal to accept the Witkoff outline for continuing talks - to which Israel agreed - Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease.\n\"Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences.\"\nThe Hamas spokesman said: \"Netanyahu's decision to stop aid going into Gaza once again shows the ugly face of the Israeli occupation...

The Israeli military said it had attacked people who were planting an explosive device in the north of the territory.\nThere are believed to be 24 hostages alive, with another 39 presumed to be dead.\nHamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking another 251 hostage.\nIsrael responded with an air and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip,  during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

        "article_text": "A trade deal between the US and UK could happen \"very quickly\", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.\nSpeaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged \"a real trade deal\" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners. \nThe trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade. \nSir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an \"unprecedented\" second state visit to the UK.  \nReceiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a \"great honour\" and described the King as \"a wonderful man\".\nSir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was \"truly historic\". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit. \nHaving confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.\nThe US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands. \nOn the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. \nHowever, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.\nAsked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a \"backstop\". \nHe said \"nobody will play around\" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals. \nThe US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\". \n\"Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,\" he said. \nHe later added he had \"a lot of respect\" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.\nThe UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders. \nHowever, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\". \nThe deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back. \nAfter taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\". \nReferring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence. \n\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said. \nHe said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century. \n\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said. \nTrump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union. \nHe also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.\nAsked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"\n\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"\nIn a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\". \nSince leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.\nIn his first term as president, Trump said talks about a \"very substantial\" trade deal with the UK were under way.\nHowever, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems. \nThe head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce - a former Labour MP and minister - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday that businesses will be encouraged by what he called an \"important first step\".\n\"In trade negotiations, relationships matter,\" says William Bain, adding that seeing the two leaders find common ground on their respective economies and trade is \"helpful\".\nHe added that a deal to keep tariffs low would most benefit automotive and pharmaceutical industries in the UK.",

        "article_text": "Was it pruning or felling? \nThe alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it.\nThe chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn.\nThe trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture.\nBut rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them.\nThe Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics. \n\"We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees,\" says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them.\nThe project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000\u20137,000 still left to be mapped.\nDespite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined.\nThis is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late.\nBut on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies.\nThe trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says.\nThe Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected \"pleasure gardens\" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment. \nThe chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today.\nAccording to government literature,  in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests. \nEmperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022.\nInterestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019.   \nBut environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees.\n\"Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled,\" he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage.\n\"The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other,\" he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally.\nChinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine.\nGovernment projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage.\nLast week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits.\n\"The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit,\" Mr Bhat says. \n\"Because without chinar, Kashmir won't feel like home.\"",

But I also know that timing and determination counts,\" von der Leyen said in Delhi, adding that such an agreement would be the largest deal of this kind anywhere in the world. \nThe EU Commission chief is in India accompanied by the entire College of Commissioners -  the first such visit after the European parliamentary elections in June 2024. \nShe met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. \nSpeaking in the Indian capital, she said the two sides wanted to deepen trade and investment collaboration in wide ranging areas like semiconductors, AI and cleantech. \nIndia and EU relaunched talks on a long pending free trade agreement in 2021 and are set to hold another round in March.\nAn India-EU summit is also being held later in the year. \nVon der Leyen also said that India and EU were pushing for renewed cooperation in security and stability and were exploring a future 'Security and Defence Partnership' with India similar to the partnerships with Japan and South Korea.\nBrussels is keen to expand its relationships in the Indo-Pacific as cracks deepen between the US and Europe over trade tariffs and Ukraine following Donald Trump's return to the White House.\nTrump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the European Union with tariffs of 25%, claiming the bloc was created to \"screw the US\".\nThe European Union said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\".\nGiven the backdrop, analysts say strong trade and security relations with India have become more important than ever for the EU.\nA trade deal has proven difficult so far due to differences in areas like agriculture and manufacturing. \nDespite renewed negotiations \"the two sides have little to show for the talks thus far\", Observer Research Foundation (ORF), a think tank, said in a note.\nHowever, some 6,000 EU companies operate in India and the bloc is India's largest trading partner in goods, with bilateral trade reaching $135bn (\u00a3107bn) in 2022-23, nearly doubling in the last decade.\nAfter years of scepticism about free trade deals, India is now actively signing agreements and negotiating with multiple countries and blocs.\nIndia and the UK restarted free trade talks this week, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries.\nLast year, India signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.",

Despite renewed negotiations \"the two sides have little to show for the talks thus far\", Observer Research Foundation (ORF), a think tank, said in a note.However, some 6,000 EU companies operate in India and the bloc is India's largest trading partner in goods, with bilateral trade reaching $135bn (\u00a3107bn) in 2022-23, nearly doubling in the last decade.After years of scepticism about free trade deals, India is now actively signing agreements and negotiating with multiple countries and blocs.India and the UK restarted free trade talks this week, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries.Last year, India signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.Ursula von der LeyenNarendra ModiIndiaEuropean UnionTrade Von der Leyen also said that India and EU were pushing for renewed cooperation in security and stability and were exploring a future 'Security and Defence Partnership' with India similar to the partnerships with Japan and South Korea.Brussels is keen to expand its relationships in the Indo-Pacific as cracks deepen between the US and Europe over trade tariffs and Ukraine following Donald Trump's return to the White House.Trump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the European Union with tariffs of 25%, claiming the bloc was created to \"screw the US\".The European Union said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\".Given the backdrop, analysts say strong trade and security relations with India have become more important than ever for the EU.A trade deal has proven difficult so far due to differences in areas like agriculture and manufacturing. \"I am well aware it will not be easy. India and EU relaunched talks on a long pending free trade agreement in 2021 and are set to hold another round in March.An India-EU summit is also being held later in the year.",

It doesn't sit well with celebrities flaunting their wealth on the red carpet.\nCancelling the whole event, however, was \"never on the table,\" according to Lynette Howell Taylor, an LA-based British film producer and member of the Academy's board of governors, who lost her own house in the fires.\nShe told me there would \"definitely be recognition of what the city has gone through\" during the ceremony, with clear signposting of support mechanisms and ways to donate.\n\"But ultimately the show will be about the celebration of the movies of the year, like it is every year,\" she said.\nThis year, the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony.\nInstead, Wicked stars Erivo and Grande will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony, which will last a reported 10 minutes long.\nI can already see social media going into a meltdown over Defying Gravity, but it remains to be seen if the duo can recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.\nDoja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony.\nThe Academy Awards ceremony is hosted this year for the first time by comedian and podcaster Conan O'Brien.\nHe replaces US late night presenter Jimmy Kimmel, who has presented the show four times including last year.\nThe 2025 Oscars will air live on Sunday 2 March from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, where the ceremony has been held since 2002.\nThe show can be watched in the US on ABC and can be streamed on Hulu.

He's recognised for playing a cardinal who oversees the selection of a new Pope in Conclave.\nElsewhere, Felicity Jones is nominated for best supporting actress for The Brutalist - a decade after her first Oscar nomination - while Sir Elton John is in the best original song race.\nThe country will also be rooting for two more screen legends - Wallace and Gromit (and their makers Aardman Animations), who are hoping for their fourth Oscar.

        "article_text": "Italian cuisine may be one of the most recognised and loved in the world \u2013 often imagined as a collection of ancient recipes and local traditions preserved by skilful nonnas over the centuries. But now, a food historian is exposing common myths and false stories, arguing that the Italian cuisine as we know it is barely a few decades old.\nFood is no doubt an integral part of the country's culture and identity \u2013 so much so that Italians cherish Neapolitan pizza or pasta alla carbonara as much as the great historical and artistic treasures of the boot-shaped peninsula. Tales abound of centuries-old local feuds over what city has the best filled pasta, while every local cheese or cured meat is likely to boast links to the Renaissance or the Middle Ages.\nAlberto Grandi, food historian and professor of economic history at the University of Parma, has been debunking Italian food myths for years. In 2018, Grandi published Denominazione di Origine Inventata (Invented Designation of Origin: The Lies of Marketing on Typical Italian Products) and later launched a podcast called DOI. But it was a 2023 interview with Financial Times that put Grandi's work into the spotlight and sparked wide debates across Italy.\nGrandi claimed in the interview that pasta alla carbonara was invented in Italy just after World War Two using US Army provisions like bacon and powdered egg yolks, countering the common belief that the authentic recipe includes pork jowl and Roman pecorino cheese. This theory is backed by other authors, like Luca Cesari in The Discovery of Pasta: A History in Ten Dishes, but caused outrage in a country increasingly obsessed with maintaining the lore of Italian authenticity in food. The discussion evolved into a heated Italian-American dispute about the origin of the iconic dish. \u00a0\nGrandi's latest book, La Cucina Italiana Non Esiste (Italian Cuisine Doesn't Exist), written with his podcast co-host Daniele Soffiati and published in April 2024, stirred new controversies with its provocative title.\u00a0\nThe idea that many beloved recipes and products such as cheeses or cured meats have hundreds of years of history, Grandi and Soffiati claim, is pure fantasy. Food is constantly changing and evolving. No product or recipe has always been as we know it now, and most dishes have a shorter history than most people imagine.\nGrandi argues that migration is what made Italian cuisine what it is today. Millions of people left Italy in the 19th and 20th Centuries, emigrating to South America, North America and European countries. They were leaving behind a country that was poverty-stricken, where the diet was limited to a handful of products. Pellagra, a disease caused by lack of vitamin B3, was endemic in several areas of Italy at the end of the 19th Century.\u00a0\nThe Italians who landed on New York's Ellis Island left hunger and misery behind. And it was in the \"new world\", Grandi argues, that Italian immigrants found the wealth and ingredients to create the recipes that eventually popularised Italian food worldwide.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's\u00a0World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nHowever, many Italians are not familiar with this history. They might imagine that their beloved recipes were born in Italy, passed down, unchanged, from generation to generation and eventually exported abroad by Italian migrants. \"It might seem that the rest of the world didn't know how to eat until all of a sudden Italians arrived,\" says Grandi. He believes it's pure myth \u2013 popularised by social media \u2013 that nonnas taught Americans how to cook rich, genuine Italian food.\nPizza is the most famous example of this. Born as a cheap street food in Naples, in the 19th Century it was almost synonymous with poverty and filth. Pizza is \"a crust of leavened bread dough, oven-toasted, with a sauce of a bit of everything on top\", wrote Pinocchio author Carlo Collodi in 1886. He added that pizza had \"an air of complex filth that perfectly matches that of its vendor\".\nIt was in America, says Grandi, that pizza became \"red\". While fresh tomatoes were among the original toppings, Italian immigrants to the US popularised pizza prepared with tomato sauce, a product that industrialisation made easy to access and store. And it was in the US that pizzerias really started to take off. \u00a0\nScholars call this process \"the pizza effect\": when a product leaves its place of origin, gets profoundly transformed and then returns to its place of origin to be fully embraced in a completely different form.\nGrandi also angered Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese producers when he argued that parmesan has evolved for the better over the last few decades, and the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that was eaten in Italy 100 years ago and earlier \u2013 a smaller wheel with a black rind \u2013 is now only made in Wisconsin.\nThe shift in the Italian culinary landscape started with the rapid expansion that occurred in Italy post-WWII. The boom brought new possibilities to millions of Italians. Cars, supermarkets and refrigerators meant that people who were limited to a daily local supply could travel to restaurants, buy new products and create new recipes. Tiramisu, says Grandi, is a great example of this: a dessert created in the late 1960s that is based on supermarket ingredients and only possible with a refrigerator. \u00a0\u00a0\nWith the new products and brands also came marketing. \"Television influenced our cuisine and gastronomical identity greatly,\" says Grandi. He argues that most of Italy's gastronomic traditions were invented by food marketers. Carosello, a short television programme that aired in Italy every night from 1957 to 1977, introduced new products and brands through stories, sketches and iconic characters. Carosello provided the consumer education upon which Italian home cuisine was then built, especially by mothers and grandmothers.\nGrandi's book explains that when industry-driven growth started to lose steam in the 1970s, Italy's economy pivoted to small companies, niche products and local excellence. Thousands of protected labels and regional products emerged and Italians doubled down on gastro-nationalism.\n\"Cuisine is no longer part of our identity,\" says Grandi, \"it is our identity.\" He argues that after decades of industry decline and economic stagnation, Italians have no faith in the future \u2013 that's why they \"invent the past\".\nIn less than a century, Grandi says, Italians went from being malnourished migrants to self-appointed custodians of ancestral traditions. The obsession for tradition has sparked searches for \"true\" recipes and \"correct\" ways of consuming food. Italians are ever more adamant to say that bolognese should be called rag\u00f9 alla bolognese and never served with spaghetti. You should also never put chicken (let alone pineapple) on pizza, cook pasta alla carbonara with cream or break spaghetti in two.\n\"I always say that every time anyone in the world adds cream to carbonara, somebody in Rome dies,\" says Grandi. \"Italians used to get upset when they were defined as 'pizza, pasta, mandolin, mafia',\" he adds. \"Now it looks like it's us Italians feeding those stereotypes.\"\nSocial media seems to have contributed to popularising these attitudes. The X account Italians mad at food, launched in 2015, showcases comments of furious Italians who are outraged and offended by how people in other nations choose to eat \"their\" cuisine. The account even sells t-shirts with quotes like \"carbonara is not an opinion\" and \"you break spaghetti, you break my heart\".\nContent creators on platforms like TikTok and Instagram have popularised a genre of video content showing Italians reacting to food \"blasphemy\", with creators and celebrities vigorously showcasing their disgust and indignation \u2013 with no shortage of drama and hand gestures.\nThe popularity of these memes is now so widespread that people might think all Italians feel offended by people's choice of pasta sauce.\nMore like this:\n\u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n\u2022\u00a0Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n\u2022\u00a0A restorative soup made for cold season\n\"Food as entertainment can be triggering, especially for Italians,\" says Aurora Cavallo, a young Italian chef known as Cooker Girl, with more than 1.3 million followers on both TikTok and Instagram. \"For many people in the world, food isn't just an object but something that carries a lot of significance,\" she adds. \"In my experience, Italians can be more sensitive not just towards recipes, but also towards how food is handled on screen.\"\nGrandi's relentless debunking of Italian food myths has made many people angry over the last few years, but he is adamant that he just wants to dispute the invented history of many products and recipes, not their quality.\nAs social media demonstrates, however, some Italians have convinced themselves that food dogmas are more important than innovations or accuracy.\n\"We don't need to make up stories about Italy's amazing products,\" says Cavallo, echoing Grandi. \"We shouldn't create a situation in which changing recipes is the end of the world because that's the opposite of how Italian food came to be.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "An Illinois landlord has been found guilty of murder and hate crime charges for fatally stabbing a Palestinian-American child in 2023 and severely wounding his mother.\nProsecutors said Joseph Czuba, 73, targeted the family over their Muslim faith following the Israel-Hamas war. \nPolice found six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume and his mother, Hanan Shaheen, with severe stab wounds inside a house she rented from Czuba in a Chicago suburb on 14 October, 2023. The boy later died in the hospital.\nCzuba had pleaded not guilty, but jurors convicted him after deliberating for less than 90 minutes.\nWarning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting\nAfter the verdict, the boy's father, Odai,told reporters in Arabic: \"I don't know if I should be pleased or upset, if I should be crying or laughing.\" \n\"I feel like this decision came a little too late,\" he said.\nJurors heard testimony from a number of witnesses, including Al-Fayoume's mother. \nMs Shaheen testified that she rented rooms from Czuba in suburban Chicago, and had no problems with him at first.\nBut tensions escalated after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, 2023, with Czuba expressing anti-Muslim views and asking her to move out of the home, where he also lived.\nA few days after that conversation, Czuba forced his way into her room and stabbed her with a knife more than a dozen times, Ms Shaheen testified.\n\"He told me 'You, as a Muslim, must die,'\" she said.\nAfter she retreated to call for help, Ms Shaheen said Czuba attacked her son.

        "article_text": "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.\nBut he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.\nMiranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.\n\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"\nShe told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.\nThat film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.\nIt's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.\nMadison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.\nWhen she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.\n\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.\nThey \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.\nWe've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.\nSome praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".\nEdie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.\nTurquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.\nShe got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.\n\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.\n\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"\nTurquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.\n\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"\nBut when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.\n\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"\nBaker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.\nShe says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.\nThey connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.\nIn the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.\nMiranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.\n\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.\nOne of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"\nThis section contains spoilers for Anora\nMiranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.\n\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.\n\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"\nTurquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.\n\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.\n\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"\nBut overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.\n\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.\n\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"\nShe said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".\n\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"\n\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"\nFor Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.\n\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\" \nFor Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.\nIn the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.\nWe also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.\n\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.\n\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"\nWhen Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.\nFootage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.\n\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.\nNow, all eyes are on the Oscars.\nMiranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.\n\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"\nShe said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.\n\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.\n\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

Dwarshuis 3-47Australia 109-1 (12.5 overs): Head 59* (40); Azmatullah 1-43Match abandoned because of rainScorecard; TablesAustralia qualified for the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy at the expense of Afghanistan as their match in Lahore was abandoned following heavy rain.Sediqullah Atal's composed 85 helped Afghanistan post a competitive, if not especially threatening, total of 273 on another batter-friendly surface at the Gaddafi Stadium.His 95-ball innings included three sixes and six fours, while Azmatullah Omarzai contributed a brisk 67 off 63 balls, hammering five sixes.Ben Dwarshuis finished as the pick of Australia's bowlers with 3-47, while fellow left-arm seamer Spencer Johnson and leg-spinner Adam Zampa picked up two wickets each.Perhaps with an eye on the weather forecast, and any possible revised total under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method, Australia began the chase with real intent.Opener Travis Head rode his luck and punished Rashid Khan's drop off Fazalhaq Farooqi at the start of the fourth over, when he was on six, by whipping the Afghanistan quick over the ropes for a maximum the next ball.Head raced to 59 in 40 balls and, with 165 runs needed from 37.1 overs, he and Steve Smith looked well set for Australia before a heavy downpour left pools of water on the outfield and conditions unplayable.The result means Australia have four points and will go through as winners of Group B if England beat South Africa in Karachi on Saturday.Should the Proteas triumph - or if their game is washed out - they will progress as group winners and Australia will go through as runners-up.Both semi-finals and the final have reserve days should they be affected by weather.Australia's replacements impressThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Johnson strikes early for AustraliaShorn of a trio of injured frontline seamers, there were question marks over whether one of cricket's traditional tournament heavyweights would carry sufficient punch in the bowling department.Replacing Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood -  who boast a combined 308 ODI appearances and 525\u202c wickets - appears on paper no easy feat for Australia.Nathan Ellis, Johnson and Dwarshuis had a collective 17 ODI caps before this match, but despite not being household names they are grizzled operators.Dwarshuis and Ellis are both 30, Johnson is 29, and all three showed short-format skills and nous garnered from the domestic franchise circuit.On the back of scores of 351, 356, 325 and 317 at the Gaddafi Stadium in the Champions Trophy so far, none of the bowling trio looked remotely flustered when Afghanistan sailed to 91-2.Johnson's menace at the start saw him remove the dangerous Rahmanullah Gurbaz for a duck with a toe-crushing yorker before he later snared Sediqullah.Dwarshuis, meanwhile, held his nerve well at the death as his excellent line drew false shots.It is not that long ago that Johnson, who holds an Italian passport through his grandfather, was set to throw his lot into Italy's bid to make a T20 World Cup, while Dwarshuis was investigating his eligibility to represent the Netherlands.Both of them - along with Ellis - now look to have a major role in Australia's attempt to win a third Champions Trophy title and their first since 2009.Smith reacts to Bairstow-esque momentThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, 'Really good sportsmanship'- Smith calls off reviewThere was a moment of Australian sportsmanship in the 47th over of Afghanistan's innings.In echoes of the controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow during the 2023 Ashes, Australia wicketkeeper Josh Inglis whipped off the bails when Noor Ahmad left his ground.Noor had stepped out from the crease before the end of the over had been called following the completion of a single.Standing umpire Kumar Dharmasena had just started to signal to the third umpire to review the incident, and another controversial dismissal looked to be on cards.However, Australia captain Smith interjected and decided to withdraw the appeal for a run out.Afghan players know things are 'not correct' - TrottPublished3 days ago'Stay true to your heart and mind' - Bavuma on mental resiliencePublished1 day agoWho's playing in Saturday's Champions Trophy match?England face South Africa in Karachi on Saturday, with the match due to start at 09:00 GMT.The Proteas are already through to the semi-finals but will have one eye on progressing as winners of Group B.England have little more than pride to play for after defeats to Australia and Afghanistan.Related topicsAfghanistanAustraliaCricketMore on this storyICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025 schedulePublished4 minutes agoYour essential guide to the ICC Champions TrophyPublished14 February",

a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.\nJapan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.\nMonster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.\n\"It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,\" he says.\n\"We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve.\"\nOther Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before.\nRyu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020. \nThe company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a \"fresh reboot\" each time. \nThis can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.\nThe Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way. \nMore recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released.\nAt last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations.\nMr Tsujimoto says he can't pinpoint a specific reason for this, but says the Monster Hunter team has learned there are certain things needed to make a \"triple-A success in today's market\".\nThat includes translating games into various languages so they can be released simultaneously in different countries, and being mindful of growing your audience.\n\"We're always careful to design the experience so new players can get into the game,\" he adds.\nJapan does face some of the same challenges as other developers worldwide.\nPlayer habits are changing, with PC gaming increasing in popularity, and as technology becomes more advanced making games becomes more expensive.\nMr Tsujimoto says generational leaps \"push the industry forward\", bringing \"new opportunities and new complexities\". \n\"I don't think it's necessarily the most difficult it's ever been but there are always new challenges whenever technology leaps forward.\"\nThe games industry is also more competitive than ever - more video games are being released, and players are tending to stick with the same ones for longer periods.\nIt leaves publishers of new releases fighting over a much smaller share of players' free time and 2025 has already been packed with big new releases.\nMr Tsujimoto insists they haven't paid too much attention to that while working on Monster Hunter Wilds.\n\"It looks like a big year for everyone but we're really all just working in our own lanes,\" he says.\n\"We happened to have this launch window that's on the verge of some other big releases but we don't have access to that information before the general public.\"\nFor an established series that suddenly explodes in popularity, Mr Tokuda says a big challenge is pleasing old and new fans.\n\"You always have in your mind that there's people waiting for your next creation and they're the players you want to satisfy,\" he says.\n\"But you also have your own creative idea and want to follow that through.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

        "article_text": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky met US President Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement that would give the US access to its deposits of rare earth minerals.\nBut after Zelensky left early following a fiery exchange with Trump and Vice-President JD Vance, the White House announced that the deal had not been signed.\nZelensky previously said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no US security guarantees had yet been agreed - something he had been pushing for.\nTrump had said a deal would help US taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war, but said the responsibility of Kyiv's security should fall to Europe.\nOn Wednesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement. It was published on Friday morning.\nThe preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction. \nShmyhal said Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\".\nAccording to the deal, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\".\nMeanwhile, the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".\nZelensky acknowledged the fund, but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\". \nThe agreement states that the US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law. \nDisagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what appears to be a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped.\n\"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine's sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC. \n\"Now, they've shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\"\nOn Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal. \nBut German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.\nZelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.\nBut on Wednesday, he said no such guarantee had been made. \n\"I wanted to have a sentence on security guarantees for Ukraine, and it's important that it's there,\" the Ukrainian leader explained. \nAsked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar.\n\"If we don't get security guarantees, we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.\"\nDespite this, the published agreement says the US supports \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".\nHe said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump \"agree on security guarantees\" and decide on how to \"tie this preliminary agreement\" to a US security guarantee.\nTrump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees \"beyond... very much\", adding that responsibility for this would now fall to Europe. \nBut he added that the presence of US workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\".\nThe prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.\nTrump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\". \nThe US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.\nTrump had said the two would sign the deal at Friday's meeting at the White House.\nUkrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said that only a framework agreement was due to be signed.\nBut nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead saw Trump and Zelensky descend into a heated exchange in the Oval Office.\nAt one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".\nHe said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"\nZelensky said there should be \"no compromises\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nNot long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.\nThe White House then announced that the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.\nThe US president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelensky had \"disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\". He added: \"He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"\nIt is now unclear when the deal might be signed, if at all.\nKyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.\nThis includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.\nUkraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.\nAlso, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.\nThere are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines. \nA quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.\nAnother issue is that it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.\n\"These resources aren't in a port or warehouse; they must be developed,\" says Mylovanov. \"In that sense if the US invests, it will benefit everyone.\"\nVladimir Putin has not yet addressed reports that the terms of a deal between the US and Ukraine have been agreed.\nBut on Monday evening he told state TV he was ready to \"offer\" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's \"new territories\" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since launching a full-scale invasion three years ago.\nPutin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia \"undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine\".\n\"As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,\" he added.\nCommenting on Zelensky's visit to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday: \"Whether it will be [to sign] the aforementioned agreement or something else, we'll see. There have been no official statements on this matter yet.\"",

But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond. \nMs McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China. \n\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said. \nThe impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.\nBut analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.\nChina has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.  \nTrump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy.

        "article_text": "The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in Belfast\nFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.\nPositive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.\nThis rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.\nIt will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.\nReferees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. \nGoalkeepers will be warned by the referee when they have five seconds remaining to get rid of the ball. The referee will raise their arm and start a visual countdown with their hand.\nYes. Well, kind of, as it was rarely enforced. The current law states if a goalkeeper holds on to a ball for six seconds, then an indirect free-kick is awarded to the opposition. \nDuring trials, Ifab said there had only been four instances where goalkeepers have been penalised in hundreds of matches, even with the rule being strictly applied.\nIfab technical director and former Premier League referee David Elleray told The Times: \"Good law changes are where you have a very strong deterrent which everybody implements and then the problem effectively disappears.\n\"If it speeds up the game, if it's more positive, it means that it could be one of those very effective deterrents.\"\nThe Club World Cup features Manchester City and Chelsea, so Premier League fans will be able to see how Ederson, Stefan Ortega, Robert Sanchez or Filip Jorgensen cope with that countdown for the first time.\nMore corners, at least at the start of the season. Set-piece coaches will start receiving even more air-time.\nEarly casualties. We already know how strictly rules are enforced when they are first brought in - just ask Declan Rice and Leandro Trossard, who both got handed second yellow cards early this season for delaying the restart.\nThe sound of the crowd sarcastically counting down when the opposition goalkeeper picks up the ball.\nExpect players to get involved, too. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.\nUnfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.\nElleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.\nSteele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.\nExploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v Arsenal\nWhat impact has longer added time had on matches?\nDoes football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?\nFormer England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: \nBack in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent. Maybe they are thinking the punishment being a bit more lenient may get things going. It seems a strange one to reintroduce, but if we can get more football in the 90 minutes then I'm all for it.\nAs a percentage there's only around a 4% chance of scoring from a corner so it isn't that much of a threat but at the end of the game, the last thing your team-mates want to do is defend a set-piece if you're winning.\nI think we see it every year, they will implement it right from the start but in a couple of years' time we may be having this same conversation.\nFormer England and Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson:\nThese rules are being made by people that have clearly never played the game.

        "summary": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The new law to tackle goalkeeper time-wasting was approved by the International Football Association Board in BelfastPublished3 hours ago851 CommentsFrom this summer onwards, goalkeepers will be allowed eight seconds from catching the ball to releasing it, in the latest attempt to cut down on time-wasting.Positive results in trials across England, Italy and Malta have prompted the games rule-makers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), to change the law for the start of the 2025-26 season.Where does this apply?This rule will be implemented worldwide by 1 July, at all levels of the game from elite to amateur.It will also be in place for the Club World Cup, which runs from 15 June to 13 July.How will referees punish it?Referees will punish goalkeepers holding on to the ball for more than eight seconds by awarding a corner to the opposition. The trend with a lot of teams is to press high to keep the opposition under pressure, but maybe now knowing the ball has to be released in eight seconds could push sides even further forward and impact the speed of games everywhere.Conor McNamara:I have quite a bit of sympathy for the referees who are going to have to implement this.In essence, the law was to be a deterrent to stop excessive holding on to the ball for 20 seconds and more. Semi-automated offsides may divert some of the personal insults away from the officials, but implementing this new law will see the individual referees catch plenty of slack again.Alistair Bruce-Ball:One thing's for certain - goalkeepers would be wise not to hang on to the ball against Arsenal next season given their prowess from corners.Anything that prevents players from time-wasting is obviously to be applauded but I can already foresee arguments about the consistency in the application of this law.I also wonder if it's something the referees will be very hot on in the first couple of weeks before it gets forgotten, not deliberately but subconsciously, and the time allowed starts slipping.Nick Mashiter: Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels will be on red alert with the new eight-second rule.The goalkeeper has been booked twice for time-wasting this season, while Jose Sa at Wolves has also been known to slow the game down to his side's advantage.The Premier League is already played at a frantic pace and this will only help maintain that speed, but the focus could be better served improving the video assistant referee and avoiding prolonged delays - including the eight-minute wait to rule out Milos Kerkez's goal for Bournemouth against Wolves on Saturday - which only frustrate fans and slow the game down further.John Murray:An interesting move but how often we will see it implemented, I wonder?I suspect it is simply another tool to try and increase the amount of playing time, which the authorities have been working on for some while. 'I feel for the refs' - what BBC reporters and commentators thinkShamoon Hafez:It feels like a rule that may be strictly enforced when first implemented, before it gets forgotten about.Just think back to how much injury time was being played when officials decided to clamp down on time-wasting and how much is added on now.It also feels like there could be a pantomime scenario during matches, with players and the crowd counting the seconds when the keeper has ball in hand.Burnley striker Ashley Barnes was signalling seconds on his fingers in Saturday's FA Cup game against Preston as Freddie Woodman held on to the ball. If a team is trailing in the dying minutes of a game and a goalkeeper has the ball, there will be players who tell the referee to count quicker... or even count for them.Are there any stats - which keepers waste time?Unfortunately, there are no Opta statistics available for this particular 'dark art' metric - but you only have to watch football semi-regularly to spot a goalkeeper catching and diving to the ground in elaborate stages.Elleray gave an example involving Brighton stopper Jason Steele from their 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford in September 2023.Steele held on to the ball for an average of 14.8 seconds, compared to Andre Onana's average of 4.8 seconds.Exploring the 'dark arts' in Man City v ArsenalPublished24 September 2024What impact has longer added time had on matches?Published11 October 2023Does football need a 60-minute 'stop-clock'?Published6 May 2022'Rules are being made by people that have never played the game' - what do ex-keepers think?Former England and West Ham goalkeeper Rob Green: Back in the day there was the six-second rule and that has slowly faded away \u2013 I don't know why \u2013 I think that was enough of a deterrent.",

        "article_text": "The biggest night in British music is upon us, as the Brit Awards gear up for their 45th edition.\nCharli XCX leads the nominations this year, with five in total - including artist of the year and album of the year, all thanks to her critically-acclaimed, trend-setting album Brat.\nThe Essex-born singer will attend the show but, surprisingly, is not expected to perform. Instead, there'll be big numbers from Ezra Collective, Sam Fender, Lola Young, and Teddy Swims.\nAn eclectic set of nominations also sees recognition for The Beatles, a Christmas song by Eurovision star Sam Ryder, and hits by TikTok stars like Artemas and KSI.\nHere's what you need to know ahead of the ceremony.\n\nIt might not have been year's biggest-selling album, but Charli XCX's Brat spawned the most conversations.\nReleased in June, it combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she'd accumulated, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nAs authentic as it was catchy, Charli's seventh album introduced her to a whole new audience... and brought her a clutch of Brit nominations.\nEarlier this week, organisers announced she'd won songwriter of the year - earning the star her first ever Brit award (she'd received nominations before in the best female and best pop act categories).\nThat sets the scene for her to dominate tonight's show. If she wins everything she's nominated for, she'll tie with Raye as the most-awarded artist in a single Brits ceremony.\nSabrina Carpenter gave one of the best performances at last month's Grammy Awards. \nArriving on stage in a sparkly tuxedo dress, she rearranged her hits Espresso and Please Please Please in a jazzy big band style, and even delivered a fleet-footed tap dance sequence.\nBetter still, she turned the whole performance into a screwball comedy - missing her cues, dropping her cane, and accidentally knocking over her set. \nA former Disney star, she sold it all with a cheeky nod and a wink, undercutting the ceremony's more self-serious acts (The Weeknd, we're looking at you).\nHopefully the singer will deliver something equally Short n' Sweet when she pops into the Brits ahead of her UK tour.\nLiam Payne had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist, so it's likely that the ceremony will include a tribute to the star - who tragically died in Argentina last October.\nGossip columns have speculated that his former bandmates would reunite to honour his memory, but with Zayn and Louis both on tour, that seems unlikely.\nAccording to The Sun, the tribute will be \"a strong section of the show and not simply an In Memoriam name-check\".\nQuoting an unnamed source, the newspaper said: \"His family aren't involved in the plans but they are being kept in the loop.\n\"The Brits are treating it with the utmost respect and sensitivity.\"\nIt's four years since Jack Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards, but his tenure was largely seen as a triumph - thanks largely to his willingness to poke fun at the stars in the audience.\n\"If you like Adele songs but find them too upbeat you're in for a treat,\" he said at the 2018 ceremony. \n\"Sam Smith will be performing.\"\nHe's been honing his script for this year's ceremony over the Atlantic, jetting over from US filming commitments with less than 48 hours to go.\nBut in a preview video, he was up to his old tricks, suggesting he should spray-paint himself orange to declare \"Make the Brits Great Again\".\n\nWith 70 nominees across 13 categories, there are lots of records up for grabs this year. Here are some of the big ones.\nInside the UK, the ceremony is broadcast live on ITV and ITVX from 20:15 GMT. International viewers can watch the show on the official Brits YouTube channel.\nBBC News will be live from the red carpet from 16:30GMT - with a live page providing coverage throughout the night. \nArtist of the year\nGroup of the year\nAlbum of the Year\nRead the full list of nominees here.\n",

New Zealand are a very good side but we played perfect cricket today.\n\"In such a short tournament you have to try and win every game that's in front of you. Australia have a rich history but it's about us.\"\nNew Zealand captain Mitchell Santner: \"It was a slower wicket than what we have come up against but we knew that coming in.\n\"If you had said we'd have to get 250, we'd have been happy. It spun more than we thought but their four quality spinners makes it pretty tough.\"\nFormer New Zealand wicketkeeper Katey Martin on BBC Test Match Special: \"New Zealand looked clueless against the spin and it was a challenging innings for Kane Williamson.\n\"It felt like they never got out of gear.

        "article_text": "Behind the closed gates of the Country Club at Woodmore, lies a world of power, luxury and one of America's wealthiest African-American communities.\nLocated in Prince George's County, Maryland - one of the wealthiest majority-black counties in the US - the country club, and its attached gated community, is the epicentre of the area's upper crust.  \nAlthough it traces its roots back to plantation-era slavery, the region has become synonymous with \"black excellence\", locals told the BBC.\nTo live there, Patricia Gafford says: \"You've got to have money \u2013 lots of it.\"\nThough Mrs Gafford is a dues-paying member of the private country club where she often plays golf, the 73-year-old says she does not live inside the gated community, because, as her husband once told her, \"'it's a little bit too rich for us'\".\nThe setting has also inspired a ground-breaking new soap opera called Beyond the Gates; its second week of programming begins on Monday. Beyond the Gates is the first new daytime soap opera on network TV in over two decades and the first hour-long daytime soap with a predominantly black cast on network TV.\nKristen Warner, an associate professor of performing and media arts at Cornell University, says seeing its release feels long overdue.\n\"Black folks have been huge supporters and viewers of soap operas since its inception,\" she told the BBC.\nYet with over 90 years of soap opera history, there has \"never\" been a black family as the main family from the start of the show, she explains.\nShe says Beyond the Gates shows that black families are just as capable of embodying the soap-opera essence of \"elegance and glamour and style and fashion\", as well as the trademark \"messiness\" of the day-time plot lines.\nThe show is set in a fictional posh Maryland suburb called Fairmont Crest and centres on the Dupree family. While its daily drama-filled plot lines are sure to be, in classic soap opera fashion, over-the-top, the setting was inspired by the very real exclusive enclave inside Prince George's County. \nThe long winding road that leads up to the Country Club at Woodmore is lined with big brick houses built like castles, and surrounded by expansive manicured lawns. A Maserati, Mercedes Benz or something similar decorates most driveways.\nThe depth of wealth in the black community was also a surprise for Sierra Balgar, who moved to Prince George's County from New York City in 2023.\n\"It was kind of like a culture shock for me to see black people with like these mega houses,\" Ms Balgar says. \nIn Woodmore, where census estimates say over 80% of the population is black, the average median household income is over $214,000 (\u00a3170,091). The average in the US is just over $80,000.\nMs Balgar too plays golf on Woodmore's course, where she occasionally hosts events for her women-of-colour centred social club, City Girls Golf. \nShe says Beyond the Gates has been \"all over social\" media and that \"everyone is excited\" about how it's putting a spotlight on a little-known hub of black affluence.\nLong before it was an axis for Washington DC's black elite, in the 1800s, Prince George's County was once known to house the most enslaved African Americans in all of Maryland, says Susan Pearl, a historian at Prince George's County Historical Society.\nOne of the largest plantations in the area, Pleasant Prospect, was located where Woodmore's gated community now stands. The street leading into Woodmore's gates carries the same name.\n\"Some of these wealthy, successful black families are living on land where hundreds of enslaved people were working for one large white property owner,\" says Ms Pearl.\nThe county was predominantly black following the Civil War, but that changed after \"a wave of violence\" against African Americans drove many of them away, says Maya Davis, chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture.\nBlack Americans started returning to the area en-masse in the early 1970s, after a court ordered the county to desegregate its schools.\nThe area soon became known for its affluence.\nAt the time, the federal government, which employs many people in nearby Washington, DC, was one of the first to implement anti-discrimination policies, giving black Americans a rare chance at better opportunities and better pay.\nFederal jobs \"played a huge role\" in creating black economic success, Ms Davis says, leading to Prince George's County eventually becoming the wealthiest majority-black county in the US.\nBy the late 80s, \"McMansions\" owned by black families began popping up, she added.\nMeanwhile, the county's white population continued to decline as large numbers of white residents began leaving the District of Columbia area in a phenomenon called \"white flight\".\nYet it wasn't until 1992 that the Country Club at Woodmore admitted its first black member - nearly 70 years after the club first opened, in 1923. He died last year.\nThe history-making Beyond the Gates arrives at a \"strange time\", media professor Ms Warner says: \"The soap opera is nearly extinct.\"\nFor most of soap opera history, she explains, black characters were secondary to the story, introduced through the lives of white families, initially in roles like housekeeper, then later as cops and lawyers.\nNBC soap opera Generations made history in 1989 when it became the first to feature a black family from the beginning, but this will be the first soap to make a black family the star of the central plot.\nThe soap is also airing amid a backlash - spearheaded by President Donald Trump's administration - against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\nBeyond the Gates was born out of a collaboration between CBS and the NAACP in 2020, following the social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a gesture of \"goodwill\" that Ms Warner says is now being \"rolled back\".\n\"In the midst of everything being taken away, we have this one little moment where there is something there for us,\" Ms Warner says, referring to the soap.\nThe club's black members say that despite a shifting political climate, Woodmore - with its rolling hills and towering pine trees - remains a safe, familiar space. \n\"When I come onto the grounds, I see people who look like me,\" says Mrs Gafford, a member.\n\"It's great to come in and see Brent (Taliaferro) behind the counter,\" she adds, referencing the club's assistant golf pro, who is also black. \n\"We all feel like we're one big family - the Woodmore family,\" he agrees. \nThere are few people at Woodmore's club Mr Taliaferro doesn't know, including Hope Wiseman, who grew up inside the gates of Woodmore.\nShe believes the name of the new soap opera is aptly titled.\n\"Everybody wants to be behind the gates, so it's funny they called it Beyond the Gates. Everybody wants to see kind of what's back there,\" Ms Wiseman says.\nShe opened a cannabis dispensary down the road in 2018, making her the youngest black woman at the time to own one.\nIt's success stories like these and people like Ms Wisemen - black entrepreneurs and black dentists, like her mom - that aren't on TV screens enough, she says.\nThat's why Ms Wiseman says she is pleased to see this new soap opera depicting her community.\n\"A lot of people don't understand what it's like to grow up around and operate in an environment where there's black excellence all around you,\" she says.\n\"That's not the experience of most of black America. That's exciting to see on TV.\"",

        "article_text": "In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks.\nOn Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die \u2013 the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade.\nWith a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows.\n\"Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,\" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons.\nThe US declared measles \"eliminated\" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus.\nThe Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.\nOn Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.\nPublic health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.\n\"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,\" Leah said.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.\nShe has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.\n\"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,\" she told the BBC.\nMs Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.\nThat includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles.\nMr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life.\n\"With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,\" he said.\nTo achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.\nBut several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.\n\"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,\" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.\nNow, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.\n\"I share that concern with them,\" said Dr Malbari.\nBefore Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.\nHe has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult\" to get vaccines.\nBut since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.\nHe also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.\nKennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of \"informed consent\" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week.\nThe moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.\nBut, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is \"what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination\".\nOn Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.\nIn addition to calling the Texas outbreak \"not unusual\", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.\nRon Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.\n\"It's a devastating disease,\" he said. \"And it's completely preventable.\"\nFor some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.\nLeah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.\n\"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,\" she said.\nBut Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.\nStill, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.\n\"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,\" she said.\nLocal health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.\n\"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,\" he said.  \"It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.\"",

        "article_text": "Norris was stunningly fast on a race-simulation run on day two of testing\nTwenty-four hours of Formula 1 pre-season testing, over three days in Bahrain this week, left the impression that McLaren will start the new season as they ended the last - as the team to beat.\nThe usual caveats apply. It is next to impossible to make definitive judgements about performance in testing as there are just too many variables involved.\nNot only that, it takes place at only one track, with one set of characteristics, and F1 cars are prototypes that do not stay the same through a season.\nMercedes' George Russell ended the final day with the fastest time, just 0.021 seconds quicker than Red Bull's Max Verstappen. And the best lap of the entire test was set by Carlos Sainz, following his switch to Williams from Ferrari to make way for Lewis Hamilton.\nBut there seemed enough evidence to suggest that McLaren, who last year won their first constructors' title since 1998, have a definitive advantage.\nThis appears less pronounced over a single lap than it does over a race distance. \nAnd the biggest proviso is that the pace of Red Bull - for whom Verstappen won a fourth consecutive drivers' title last year - is particularly hard to divine.\nFerrari 'have work to do', says Hamilton\nThe sense that McLaren were a step ahead of their rivals at Bahrain's Sakhir track was founded on some eye-catching pace on race-simulation runs.\nThese are always the most reliable indicators of true competitiveness in testing because a key variable is removed. Teams do a full grand prix distance so the level of fuel is known, even if other settings, such as engine modes, may still not be comparable from car to car.\nOn the afternoon of the second day of testing, McLaren's Lando Norris did a race-simulation run at the same time as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Mercedes' Andrea Kimi Antonelli. The Briton's pace was breathtaking.\nHe would have won the 'race' by more than 30 seconds, and was on average more than 0.5secs a lap quicker than his rivals.\nLeclerc would have finished about two seconds ahead of Antonelli.\nOn the final afternoon, Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri and Mercedes' George Russell were out at the same time doing the same thing.\nAgain, the McLaren was faster, although not by as much. Piastri was an average of 0.2secs a lap quicker than Russell. That would mean winning by just over 10 seconds.\nHowever, Piastri's advantage was nearly all gained in the first stint, in which he was 0.5secs quicker than Russell. In the second and third stints, the McLaren's advantage was just 0.05secs.\nIt's pointless comparing the times of Norris, Leclerc and Antonelli with those of Piastri, Russell from one day to the next, because Thursday was cooler and less windy than Friday. \nF1 cars are faster in cooler conditions because the higher air density increases both downforce and engine performance, and wind is bad news for the cars' sensitive aerodynamics.\nOver one lap, the McLaren's pace was less outstanding - but then it's harder to tell that in testing. For what it's worth, McLaren seem pretty level-pegging over a single lap with Ferrari, a Verstappen-driven Red Bull and Mercedes.\nMcLaren were keen to play down any claims that they were ahead.\nTeam principal Andrea Stella said he \"would be very careful\" about drawing conclusions from Norris' run, suggesting the usually cool conditions in Bahrain \"were in a sweet spot for our car - they were conditions our car enjoys, cool, not much wind\".\nStella's point is that the conditions perhaps masked some of the weaknesses McLaren have had in Bahrain in recent years - the track's combination of mainly slow corners and traction-dominated layout do not play to the car's strengths, especially in the heat that is normally typical in the desert.\nBut there is another way of looking at that. If McLaren can be this quick on a circuit that does not suit their car, just how good could they be at Melbourne, which on paper is much more their kind of track?\nThe McLaren excels in the sort of medium-speed corners and low-grip surface that are typical at Albert Park, where front-end performance is the main limitation for an F1 car, not rear as in Bahrain.\nNorris, sitting in a news conference with Verstappen and Leclerc, said: \"If we want to improve anything at the moment, it's the rear, but the rest of it feels correct and feels in the same ball park.\n\"I don't think we are expecting to be a big step ahead of everyone. We are expecting to be close to the guys to my right. If we are there from the off, that's the main thing.\"\nHamilton has been getting to know his Ferrari team and car\nHamilton has been full of optimism about the start of his Ferrari career, both before and during the Bahrain test.\nHe said the car was giving him \"the most positive feeling I've had for a long time\". Hardly a surprise after three difficult seasons with Mercedes.\nAnd he said his work getting used to the team could not have gone better, after a month embedded in Italy before Bahrain.\n\"I feel like we've built a really good foundation,\" Hamilton said. \"But these guys out there look really competitive. It looks very close. We won't know until Melbourne where we stand but we know we've got work to do.\"\nHamilton's test did not end on a particularly happy note - he stopped running early, and a planned race-simulation did not happen.\nLeclerc said the race run against Norris \"was a really important run to understand where we were lacking compared to them\".\nBut he also said the weather in Bahrain had made it harder than usual to understand where the teams sat.\n\"The conditions have been so inconsistent, which makes testing a lot more difficult to take anything out of,\" he said on Friday.\n\"The wind has changed a lot, yesterday we even had rain, and the temperature was very low on the first day. So very difficult to have a lap-time reference, which is important for the team.\n\"We are probably going into the first race with a bit more unknown than other years.\"\nVerstappen is aiming to secure his fifth consecutive drivers' championship in 2025 after beating Lando Norris to the title last season\nAny assessment of testing is always going to be inexact, based as it is on hints and snapshots of something necessarily opaque. And that is especially the case with Red Bull.\nThe problem is that they did not do a full race simulation - and Verstappen appeared not to do a race run at all.\nOn Thursday, the Dutchman's new team-mate Liam Lawson did 43 laps of a 57-lap grand prix distance. The New Zealander was more than a second a lap on average slower than Norris. But it's hard to draw any conclusions about the car from that because Lawson's level is unknown.\nVerstappen did do one run on Friday that looked very quick - a stint of seven laps had him faster than the race-distance averages of Piastri and Russell.\nThat would put him at a similar level to Norris the day before.\nBut there are a lot of assumptions in that - his fuel load is unknown as the run was so short, the conditions were different to Thursday, the performance level of the individual Mercedes and McLaren drivers, and so on.\nVerstappen was fastest of all for a period on the final afternoon, until Russell pipped him with six minutes to go.\nBut single lap times are especially unreliable in testing, and on top of that the car did not look comfortable. Verstappen was visibly fighting it.\nIt lacked front grip in some places, rear grip in others - just as it did in the team's period of struggle last year, when Verstappen would talk about the car feeling \"disconnected\" - and he even had a spin at Turn One.\nRed Bull spent the day experimenting with new parts. A new front wing design was fitted early on Friday. But then the car spent considerable time in the garage with the doors closed - which means the floor was off, because that's the only circumstances in which teams are allowed to shut their garages.\nAnd by the end of the day, Verstappen had reverted to the original front wing.\nTechnical director Pierre Wache admitted the team had concerns. \"I am not as happy as I could be because the car did not respond how we wanted at times,\" he said in a video issued by the team.\n\"But it is going in the right direction, just maybe the magnitude of the direction was not as big as we expected.\"\nVerstappen's only comments to the media were made after he had had just half a day in the car.\nAsked if the team had solved the problems that turned his title campaign into a rear-guard battle last year, he said: \"It can't be worse than last year. The direction we are working in is good. It is really early days. It has improved everywhere compared to last year. It's positive.\"\nLawson said: \"Everyone has new cars but not a huge amount has changed. We can expect the performance, especially of McLaren, last year to probably start like that this year.\"\nPierre Gasly and Alpine impressed on the final day by finishing fifth on the timesheets \nWilliams had an eye-catching test. Sainz's fastest time came on a qualifying simulation on Thursday, and a similar run on Friday put team-mate Alex Albon fastest for a while, before he ended the final day third quickest.\nSainz's pace caught the eye of Stella, who said Williams looked \"very competitive - I'm really stating the obvious, because everyone will have seen the data\".\nAlpine, too, produced some decent lap times, particularly with Pierre Gasly.\nBut Williams team boss James Vowles does not believe the midfield will have significantly closed on the big teams. \n\"Top four will be the top four,\" Vowles said. \"[There is a] large gap between them and the midfield.\"\nAnd again surface impressions might be misleading.\nWilliams looked in decent shape judging by the headline lap times, while Aston Martin, who had a quiet test, appeared as if they may be in trouble.\nBut teams' data suggests otherwise - the info behind the headline numbers suggests Aston Martin and Alpine are best of the rest, followed by Williams, Racing Bulls and Haas, with Sauber bringing up the rear.\nBut form is likely to fluctuate race to race.\n\"The midfield is going to be very tight,\" Vowles said, \"and if I'm getting it right, 0.1secs separates a lot of us.\"\nThat could well be the case at the front as well.",

        "article_text": "The legendary actor tells Katty Kay that his parents would have much rather he became an accountant or insurance broker, but finally came around when they saw him perform on stage.\nWith a shelf filled with awards, including Screen Actors Guild trophies, Emmys, a Golden Globe, a Tony and a pair of Olivier Awards, 86-year-old Sir Derek Jacobi has proven to be much more than \"the classical Shakespearean actor of our generation,\" as BBC special correspondent Katty Kay describes him during an interview at his home in London.\nSir Derek credits a serendipitous combination of luck and talent for his decades-long career, which includes roles in blockbusters like Gladiator and its 2024 sequel, and stints on sitcom Frasier, for which he won the 2001 Emmy for outstanding guest actor in a comedy series.\n\"Somehow, I was born to be an actor. That's what I feel. There was never any alternative,\" Sir Derek says about first appearing on the stage at the age of 17. He was born in north-east London to a father who ran a sweet shop and a mother who was a secretary. \"That's what I wanted. That's what I thought I could do. That's what I enjoyed.\"\nEnjoying the spotlight was just a part of his success. Sir Derek notes that after he found himself at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre (which he affectionately calls the Rep) in 1960, there wasn't anything else that matched the euphoria of basking in an audience's applause. It was a far cry from what his parents had hoped for. Like most, they'd expected their son to go into a field with stability, like accounting or insurance.\nWhere to find Influential with Katty Kay\nWatch\u00a0Influential with Katty Kay live on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel or stream the full episode on\u202fYouTube.\n\"I always thought\u2026 I wanted to be an actor. I had no talent for anything else,\" he says. \"Hamlet confirmed it.\" After reciting one of the doomed prince's monologues to Kay, Sir Derek admits that most of his roles have disappeared into the ether, but the work of the Bard has stayed with him since those early performances almost 70 years ago. \"All the other parts have gone. Hamlet's still around. Shakespeare stays.\"\nSir Derek is quick to name drop some of his esteemed colleagues: Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Laurence Olivier, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Albert Finney and Sir Robert Stephens. But he's as quick to note that he didn't have the classical training many of them had. He tells Kay that it was a bit of luck that led to his successes, which include being knighted by the late Queen Elizabeth II and earning the Danish Order of the Dannebrog.\n\"I think there's talent and I think there's luck. Without that luck, the talent isn't enough on its own,\" he says. \"You've got to have the opportunity to show you've got talent. Without that opportunity\u2026 nobody's seeing it.\"\nMore like this:\u00a0\n\u2022 It took nearly 60 years for Brooke Shields to overcome her imposter syndrome\n\u2022 Ina Garten on her internet appeal: 'Young people don't have mom in the kitchen'\u00a0\n\u2022 Olympic legend Lindsey Vonn explains the mindset of a winner\u00a0\nAnother obstacle Jacobi notes was the fact that he was never seen as classically handsome. \"They had a head start because they were nice to look at,\" he says of Stephens and Olivier, while he credits being able to hone his craft in front of an audience from the age of 17 as what set him apart. He tells Kay that luck landed him that first job and his time at the Rep stood in for drama school. \"It was a huge learning experience.\"\nAnd although Sir Derek says he hasn't stopped learning, he works at a different pace now, and has learned to find new ways of working.\n\"You slow down,\" the 86-year-old says. \"It's more difficult to remember lines. I used to have a very sharp brain. I don't anymore. That, obviously, is age.\" These days, he has some help with those lines via an earpiece just in case, with Kay likening it to a skier using a knee brace.\u00a0\n\"I've really had a charmed life,\" Sir Derek says, reflecting on his career, his long-time husband, theatre director Richard Clifford, and the fact that he can still do what he loves. Sir Derek's upcoming projects include appearances in episodes of Doctor Who Unbound and Good Omens as well as films The Vampyre: Blood & Ink, with Malcolm McDowell and action-comedy Tinsel Town, alongside Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland.\n\"I can't complain about anything in my life.\"\nInfluential with Katty Kay airs on Fridays at 21:30 ET on the BBC News channel.\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

New Zealand are a very good side but we played perfect cricket today.\n\"In such a short tournament you have to try and win every game that's in front of you. Australia have a rich history but it's about us.\"\nNew Zealand captain Mitchell Santner: \"It was a slower wicket than what we have come up against but we knew that coming in.\n\"If you had said we'd have to get 250, we'd have been happy. It spun more than we thought but their four quality spinners makes it pretty tough.\"\nFormer New Zealand wicketkeeper Katey Martin on BBC Test Match Special: \"New Zealand looked clueless against the spin and it was a challenging innings for Kane Williamson.\n\"It felt like they never got out of gear.

        "article_text": "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.\nCharli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.\nUS star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.\nBut no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.\nListen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night. \nThe pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.\nReleased in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.\nIn the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".\nJust as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.\nCritics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age. \nKnowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.\n\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.\n\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"\nTeddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.\nJade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all. \nAs well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.\nOver the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.\nJack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.\nAs ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.\n\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.\nLater, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".\n\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"\nSpeaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.\n\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.\n\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"\n\"I'm wearing shades because I mashed up my eye playing padel [ball],\" said Stormzy, as he accepted the prize for best rap/hip-hop artist.\n\"I've got a very sore eye. I've got a bruised cornea.\n\"My eye's sore under here, I'm not being a mad man with shades on inside.\"\nSabrina Carpenter pretended to pleasure a Beefeater. \nCharli XCX gave a speech in a see-through top, with no bra. \nOne of Jade Thirlwall's dancers mooned at the camera. \nDanny Dyer uttered one of the English language's most offensive swear words.\nI'd guess that ITV's responses to Ofcom are going to make an interesting read.\nWord of the censor's concerns even filtered through to the arena during the show, much to Charli's annoyance.\n\"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said from the podium. I feel like we're in the era of free the nipple though, right?\"\nAs fans applauded, the singer grimaced: \"They put the clap track on, cool. Thanks for being on my side.\"\nThe Brits were set up in 1977 to celebrate the British Music Industry, and they are run by the BPI - an organisation funded by, and representing, the biggest record labels in the country.\nBut lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.\n\"Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments - because moments fade and careers take time,\" said Myles Smith. \"So please stick with artists past a viral hit.\"\nChappell Roan, who won best international artist, had a similar plea.\n\"I had to write a lot of bad songs to get to the good ones - and artists deserve that freedom, to explore horrible concepts, and to flop, and rise, and not be pressured into making music based off of what's trending.\"\nCharli XCX's multiple victories proved their point. Signed at the age of 14, she had to fight to make the music she wanted - after years of being told her songs were too abrasive and uncommercial.\n\"It feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven't made any sacrifices,\" she said.\n\"I've been doing my own thing in my own corner of the industry - and I guess, this time, culture caught up with us.\"\nMyles Smith has had an incredible 12 months. After giving up his job to pursue music, his feel-good pop anthem Stargazing went viral. So viral that it ended up as the best-selling British song of 2024.\nAsked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.\n\"And that said two things. One: This is like, the most irritating thing. But at the same time, I had made it to hold.\"\n\"Did you sing it for the operator when they picked up?\" we asked. \n\"No, I was passed to seven more people.\"\nSee? Being a pop star doesn't give you any shortcuts in the world of broadband service provider call centres.\nWhy did Jared Leto open his red carpet interview by trying to teach us an English accent?\nTo find out, you'd have to ask Jared Leto and, frankly, we're too scared.\nSabrina Carpenter was the night's biggest star - opening the show with a cheeky wink, a phalanx of Beefeaters and a vaudevillian mash-up of Espresso, Bed Chem and... er, Rule, Britannia.\nBut was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?\nThe prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).\nSix years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.\nTo be fair, the singer racked up an incredible 21 weeks at number one in the UK singles chart last year - more than anyone has ever achieved in a single calendar year - so her trophy wasn't entirely undeserved. \nA lot of viewers were left perplexed when Jack Whitehall sat down with Danny Dyer and what appeared to be his date: A woman with a horse for a face (we're not being unkind, see above for proof).\nWell, it turns out that Danny's neighbour was a German DJ who goes by the name of HorsegiirL and keeps their identity hidden behind a mask. Sort of like Deadmau5, but with fetlocks.\nMaybe next year she can come back to do a duet with Foals.\n \nEzra Collective made history by becoming the first jazz band to win the Brit Award for best group - beating previous title-holders like Coldplay, The Cure and Bring Me The Horizon.\nTaking to the stage, frontman Femi Koleoso had a few words to say about cuts to music education, and the lack of funding for youth clubs like Tomorrow's Warriors - where his band got their start.\n\"I'll bang this drum a bunch of times and I'll continue to do so until the entire country gets it\", he said.\n\"This moment right here is because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music.\n\"The reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK...  we're unsure of how to fix it, but the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies in giving a young person a saxophone.\n\"Because when you do that, you give them a dream, an aspiration and a goal.\"\nTo prove his point, he invited the London youth group Kinetika Bloco onto the stage of the O2, to blast through Ezra Collective's infectiously upbeat jazz anthem Shaking Body.\nThis year's Brit Award trophies, designed by Gabriel Moses, were cast in bronze... And they were heavy. \nWeighing 1.6kg each, you could break a toe if you dropped one. And Charli had to pick up four of the things for her winner's photo.\nIt took approximately six people to arrange them in her arms (\"don't push them between my boobs\", she squealed at one point) before she was ready for the flashbulbs.\n\"Is this lame?\" she asked at the last moment. \"It feels lame.\"\nThen she dropped them all and fell to the floor in a fit of giggles.",

Brit Awards 2025: The real winners and losers1 hour agoShareSaveMark SavageMusic CorrespondentShareSaveGetty ImagesNudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.Charli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.US star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.But no-one's only interested in all that.
