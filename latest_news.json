        "article_text": "A new type of tobacco product is finding growing numbers of users around the world, but there are still serious questions about how it affects human health.\nHaving smoked for nearly 30 years since the age of 13, IT consultant and freelance writer Ben Taylor was intrigued by the sound of heated tobacco products.\nAttempting to switch from cigarettes to vapes hadn't worked for Taylor. \"Vaping liquids always left me wanting,\" he posted on his blog. So he decided to try IQOS, a sleek, pen-shaped electronic device that heats sticks of rolled tobacco, developed by the American multinational tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI).\nRather than burning tobacco, these devices heat it to a temperature high enough to create a vapour but not smoke.\nFor Taylor, it didn't quite replicate the experience of smoking a cigarette, but it came much closer than vaping \u2013 the other popular cigarette alternative, which uses handheld pens to heat a flavoured nicotine-containing liquid. \"You can tell you're consuming real tobacco,\" Taylor wrote. Over time, he says, he came to prefer IQOS due to the taste, and the lack of a lingering cigarette stench. He also says his previously near-permanent cough disappeared.\nTobacco manufacturers that sell heated tobacco devices market them as being a less harmful alternative to cigarettes. They point to industry-funded research that shows they produce lower levels of compounds known to be harmful to human health.\nBut there is growing concern in the medical community that these devices still pose a health risk to both the people who use them and those standing nearby. They also warn that as relatively new products, the long-term effects of using heated tobacco have still to be properly investigated.\nYet they are also becoming increasingly common, with next-generation heated tobacco products now available in more than 60 countries. They have experienced particularly notable growth in both\u00a0Italy and Japan,\u00a0where they have been present since 2014. And this growth is expected to continue as they start to penetrate the market in the US.\nSo, is heated tobacco really helping people enjoy nicotine in a less harmful way, or could it be a new public health crisis in the making?\nIQOS and other devices like it are the latest iteration of a concept which the tobacco industry has been intermittently toying with for the past four decades. In 1988, an American tobacco company called RJ Reynolds\u00a0attempted to commercialise the very first heated tobacco product, a device called Premier. Designed to look similar to a conventional cigarette in shape and size, the Premier had a specifically designed carbon tip that users would light to heat the tobacco. But despite a reported $300m (roughly \u00a3180m at the time) in investment, Premier\u00a0was removed from the market\u00a0after just six months as users complained about its taste and smell.\nAfter various reinventions, heated tobacco products have started to enjoy commercial success in the past decade with a new range of electronic devices that use several methods to vaporise their contents. Typically these involve encasing tobacco in either sticks, plugs, capsules or pods, which are then heated with an electronic element. As well as PMI's IQOS, leading brands include Ploom, made by Japan Tobacco International (JTI), and glo, made by British American Tobacco (BAT).\nEmploying sleek, appealing designs and backed by\u00a0multi-million dollar marketing strategies \u2013 which have included everything from social media influencers\u00a0to pop-up stores \u2013 these devices have been far more successful than the original incarnations. Celebrities\u00a0have backed heated tobacco products, with the\u00a0musician Jamiroquai and actors Alberto Amman and Monica Cruz attending the IQOS 3 launch party in Madrid in 2019. Jamiroquai also performed at\u00a0a 2018 launch event\u00a0for IQOS 3 in Milan, while American dance music DJ Steve Aoki, whose name is attached to a limited edition version of an IQOS device,\u00a0performed a concert at another event for the products in Barcelona in January 2025.\nBAT have also\u00a0employed similar marketing tactics, paying social media influencers, sponsoring boat parties and organising giveaways at Formula 1 races.\nSo far, heated tobacco products have had limited penetration in the US. While one survey of 40,000 US adults found that 8% were aware of them, only 0.5% had ever used one of the devices. But that could change. After first receiving a\u00a0limited authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019, IQOS is\u00a0now re-entering\u00a0the US market in Austin, Texas.\nThe tobacco industry\u00a0promotes this new generation of heated tobacco products as a safer, smoke-free alternative, stressing that they only heat, not burn tobacco. PMI's website, for example,\u00a0states\u00a0that they aim to remove \"combustion of tobacco, the cause of most tobacco-related diseases\", celebrating IQOS as \"the next step in tobacco harm reduction\". The company\u00a0estimates that more than 22 million adults\u00a0globally have quit smoking cigarettes and switched to its heated tobacco products.\nPMI has said in the past that it intends to stop selling cigarettes and become a smoke-free company. It is investing heavily in products such as heated tobacco and hopes for at least two-thirds of its revenues to come from smoke-free products by 2030.\u00a0\nBut independent researchers and public health experts argue that heated tobacco products are still harmful to human health and urge users to give up tobacco altogether. They express concerns at some of the marketing strategies, saying that the use of influencers and glamorous launch parties could encourage heated tobacco use among young people, who are more likely not to have smoked before, which could make these products a gateway to cigarettes.\u00a0\nPMI, JTI and BAT all insist their products are aimed at adults only. PMI says it has a robust code of conduct that does not allow marketing that appeals to minors such as cartoons, youth-orientated celebrities or models who are or appear to be under the age of 25. BAT said they carry out due diligence on any influencer partnerships to ensure that a significant majority of their followers are over 18 years old. JTI says it is \"committed to the principle that minors should never use or access nicotine-containing products\". It says it ensures it markets its heated tobacco products in a \"socially responsible way\" in accordance with applicable laws and rules.\nBut Silvano Gallus, an epidemiologist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, believes that existing smokers do not appear to be the main audience for these products, despite the messaging from tobacco firms. He first started monitoring the rollout of heated tobacco products more than a decade ago.\n\"We began to see the promotion of these products everywhere with advertisements, events and parties, particularly aimed at young people,\" says Gallus, reflecting on the initial launch of heated tobacco in the cities of Milan and Nagoya, Japan.\u00a0\nIn 2019, PMI suspended a social media campaign involving digital influencers after the news organisation Reuters revealed the company had been using young online personalities to market its products, including a 21-year-old woman, in breach of its own code of conduct. PMI said at the time that no laws were broken, but acknowledged that the campaign failed to meet the company's standards.\nGallus claims that the users of heated tobacco products in Italy tend to be young, pointing to surveys which have described their use as widespread among adolescents. \"They aren't 60-year-old hardcore smokers looking for an alternative to cigarettes,\" he says.\u00a0\nPMI, however, insists that unintended use among youths is low in the 70 markets where IQOS is currently available. It points to a survey in 2021 funded by the Japanese government that showed 0.9% of those questioned in junior high school (aged 13-15) and 1.4% of those in high school (aged 16-18) said they used heated tobacco. It is illegal to smoke or buy tobacco in Japan under the age of 20. Other studies in countries around the world show use among youths is in the low single digits, PMI says.\nBut there is concern among public health experts that if young people who have never smoked cigarettes really are drawn to heated tobacco products, it could introduce new groups of people to potentially harmful habits.\nIn 2024, Gallus and a group of fellow tobacco control researchers in Italy published a study based on data from more than 3,000 Italians aged between 18 and 74, who they tracked for six months during 2020. They found that non-smokers who began using heated tobacco products were 5.8 times as likely to subsequently transition to smoking within the six month study period as people who had never used heated tobacco products.\n\"We know that this product is a gateway to conventional cigarettes,\" says Gallus. It is a concern shared by other researchers.\nBut PMI describes Gallus' study as unreliable and says that heated tobacco can provide a route out of smoking. Gallus and his colleagues acknowledge themselves that their study had a limited sample size and needs to be verified with larger studies. The results may also have been impacted by the pandemic and widespread lockdowns which were taking place at the time.\nResearchers like Gallus, however, view heated tobacco products as a setback in the battle to drive down tobacco use and have accused the industry of cynically targeting young people. They point to the fact that, to date, marketing for IQOS has appeared at music festivals and film festivals in Europe, Asia and South America, alongside high profile partnerships with streetwear brands and fashion designers.\nIt is a concern echoed by the World Health Organization (WHO). In a\u00a02023 summary of evidence, experts at the WHO\u00a0warned that the lower cost of heated tobacco sticks compared to a pack of cigarettes \"undermines the progress made in reducing use that was accomplished by making products more expensive\". The report, which was by Bloomberg Philanthropies, an organisation that invests heavily in reducing tobacco use, added that the marketing of heated tobacco products often combined claims of reduced harm relative to cigarettes with \"the passion for technology of primarily young people\".\nAccording to a report produced by the non-profit organisation Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids \u2013 which also receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies \u2013 influencer-driven campaigns on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok,\u00a0X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube have also played a key role in raising the visibility of IQOS and other heated tobacco brands. A study by researchers at the University of Rochester in the US also found that Instagram posts featuring heated tobacco products often position the devices as lifestyle products by showing them alongside models, swimming pools or a luxury car. Posts with models or lifestyle elements received higher engagement.\u00a0\nPMI categorically denies marketing its heated tobacco products to young people and says it does not have an official account on TikTok, while its account on X is used for customer care only. The company also says at least 75% of the audience must be over the legal age for purchasing tobacco products at any third-party events it sponsors. PMI claims 82% of IQOS users are over the age of 29, according to its own estimates.\nBut the debate over the marketing of heated tobacco also obscures another issue \u2013 these products are so new that there is still little research to assess their long-term health effects.\nMost research on the vapour emissions from heated tobacco products have been funded by tobacco companies or carried out by scientists directly employed by them. They show that heated tobacco aerosols contain significantly fewer harmful compounds than cigarette smoke.\nSome studies by independent researchers have also found that switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco can be beneficial in some people \u2013 such as patients with chronic lung disease. But other scientific research also suggests that heated tobacco products are unlikely to be benign for our health.\u00a0\nIn 2017, a group of Swiss scientists published a study disputing one of PMI's central marketing claims, namely that IQOS is smoke-free because of the lack of combustion or burning of the tobacco leaves.\u00a0\nInstead, the researchers argue that the emissions from heated tobacco devices should still be considered as \"smoke\" and should fall under indoor smoking bans in the same way as cigarettes. Their study showed that IQOS tobacco reaches around 330C (626F), a finding supported by other studies, while a conventional cigarette reached around 684C (1,263F).\nIn their subsequent analysis of IQOS emissions, they concluded that the heated tobacco vapour also contained harmful chemicals which stem from pyrolysis \u2013 the term for incomplete combustion \u2013 and thermogenic degradation, making it more similar to cigarette smoke than the company was claiming. \"Smokers and non-smokers need accurate information about toxic compounds released in IQOS smoke,\" the scientists wrote.\u00a0\nPMI was quick to respond to the study, sending the authors a letter disputing many of the results. A subsequent analysis by the FDA also warned there were \"significant analytical issues\" with the study that made it difficult to compare the levels of harmful and potentially harmful compounds from heated tobacco to those from cigarettes. PMI maintains that IQOS heats tobacco but does not burn it.\nOther research, however, has examined the type and quantity of toxins present in the vapours produced by heated tobacco.\nAt the National Technical University of Athens, chemical engineer Efthimios Zervas has spent much of the past decade painstakingly analysing the chemicals present in the fumes of products including IQOS and glo. He describes it as a slow and complex process because the fumes emitted contain many thousands of different chemicals, in combinations that vary greatly from one product to another.\u00a0\n\"We try to study as much as we can, but it's difficult because as soon as we publish our results, this product we've been analysing has either been modified or is no longer on the market,\" he says. \"So you're constantly playing catch-up with the industry.\"\nStill, Zervas has drawn a number of conclusions. As with cigarettes, he has found that heated tobacco products release high concentrations of fine particles, capable of penetrating deep into the body. Other studies have identified known toxins present in the gaseous emissions. Indeed, many toxins and carcinogens were present at far lower concentrations in heated tobacco vapours than in fumes from cigarettes. But Zervas has found others, such as carbonyl methylglyoxal, that he says are actually emitted in higher concentrations by heated tobacco products.\u00a0\n\"There are toxic products in there, so we cannot say that these devices are safe,\" says Zervas.\nPMI says that its own research indicates that IQOS does not generate solid particles in the aerosol it emits.\nIndustry-backed studies have also reported a long list of compounds in the aerosols from heated tobacco \u2013 one study by BAT found more than 120 while another detected 205 compounds in the aerosols, including 82 not seen in cigarette smoke. These include compounds that are the result of heating glycerol, which is one of the ingredients in heated tobacco sticks. The WHO has called for more research to evaluate the effect of these compounds on human health when inhaled at the relatively high levels in heated tobacco aerosols.\nMeanwhile early studies in animals indicate that there may be some long-term effects of heated tobacco on cardiovascular health and the central nervous system, but these results are yet to be seen in humans.\nSuch sentiments have been noted by regulators. While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised PMI to market multiple heated tobacco products, it also declared that this \"does not mean these products are safe nor FDA approved\". The FDA also says, \"There are no safe tobacco products, so those who do not currently use tobacco products, especially young people, should not start.\"\nAll three of the tobacco companies the BBC spoke to acknowledge that it would be incorrect to say heated tobacco products are safe or risk free. But they say research indicates that they provide a way of reducing exposure to harmful compounds if smokers switch from cigarettes to heated tobacco products.\n\"This fundamental principle underpins the promise that smoke-free products like IQOS hold for advancing global health and further validates PMI's commitment to a smoke-free future,\" says Moira Gilchrist, PMI's global chief communications officer.\n\"The majority of risk associated with cigarettes comes from the burning of tobacco and not the nicotine,\" says a BAT spokesperson. \"glo, while not risk free, does not involve burning tobacco.\" Footnotes in their response, however, added that their statement assumes a complete switch from cigarette smoking and notes that their product is addictive and not risk free.\n\"JTI does not market any of its products including heated tobacco products as smoking cessation products,\" says a JTI spokesperson. \"They are an alternative for smokers looking for products with the potential to reduce the risks associated with smoking.\"\u00a0\nThere are some who question the science that major companies are using to promote heated tobacco products. The European Respiratory Society Tobacco Control Committee published a position paper in February 2024 on the subject. The paper states that, while the tobacco industry claims a 90-95% reduction in harmful and potentially harmful substances and toxicity for heated tobacco products, this is not the full picture. Independent research shows these products emit substantial levels of carcinogenic, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, irritants and potential carcinogens, as well as similar nicotine and tar levels to a standard cigarette, the paper states.\nSome researchers have also cast doubt on the clinical trials conducted by tobacco companies themselves. In 2022, a systematic review by the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group \u2013 which receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies and are part of STOP, a global tobacco industry watchdog \u2013 concluded that PMI's clinical trials of its heated tobacco products were of poor quality and at high risk of bias.\u00a0\nPMI did not provide a response to these allegations when asked by the BBC, but it characterised the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group as an \"unreliable and inaccurate source of information\". It did not provide any further evidence to support this accusation.\nWith other forms of smokeless tobacco also on the rise, which can be chewed, sucked or snuffed, many anti-tobacco lobbyists are frustrated by the lack of progress. Staying ahead of the proliferation of new forms of tobacco consumption is like playing a game of \"whack-a-mole\", says Sandra Mullin, senior vice-president of policy, advocacy and communication at Vital Strategies, an international non-profit organisation that has partnered with governments around the world to develop tobacco control policies.\n\"I was in China in January, and they showed us these new models of heated tobacco products that don't look like tobacco, they look like a toy,\" she says, adding that she would like to have more data that demonstrates whether there are serious health impacts from such products.\nOne aspect that is particularly worrying public health officials, including the WHO, is that these devices may actually encourage people to consume more tobacco. A 2022 systematic review by researchers in the UK concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show they help people to stop smoking. The 2023 WHO report on heated tobacco also warns that the available data indicates that most smokers become dual users and \"do not substantially reduce their risk from tobacco products\".\nGallus and his colleagues recently published a review of 26 studies on the use of heated tobacco products conducted around the world since 2022. Two out of three heated tobacco users are dual users, he and his colleagues concluded.\nAccording to Gallus, dual users have a significantly higher risk of disease and premature death compared with smokers.\n\"If you're not actually reducing tobacco consumption, it undoes any potential reduced harm effects, and the industry's just making money from people twice over,\" says Sophie Braznell, a researcher in the University of Bath's Tobacco Control Research Group and a spokesperson for STOP.\nPMI claims its own data demonstrates the majority of IQOS users have given up smoking. It estimates 72% of IQOS users are people who have fully switched from cigarettes. JTI and BAT did not respond to questions about dual use of their products.\nBut with IQOS returning to the US, starting with the devices going on sale in Austin, Texas in March 2025, Yolonda Richardson, president and chief executive of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, is concerned that more people will become users of multiple tobacco or nicotine products. E-cigarettes\u00a0remain popular among younger people while nicotine pouches that are placed between the lip and gum are now showing signs of growing in popularity, with the CDC reporting a substantial increase in nationwide sales in the US since 2016.\nHowever, Richardson says that it may take a long time before the full health consequences become apparent. When they do, it will be exceedingly difficult to pinpoint the underlying source, as individuals will have been exposed to different concentrations of nicotine in different forms, as well as varying sources of tobacco.\nZervas argues that the onus should be on the tobacco industry to prove that its products are not dangerous before they're able to enter the market, rather than the other way round.\n\"It's like with food or drugs,\" he says. \"We study them first and, if they're safe, we allow them. With the tobacco industry's products, we allow them into the market and then have to prove they're dangerous, or very dangerous.\"\n--\u00a0\nFor\u00a0trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter,\u00a0while\u00a0The Essential List\u00a0delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

        "article_text": "\"It's not our night,\" Australia's opposition leader Peter Dutton told a roomful of supporters in Brisbane after his rival, Anthony Albanese, was re-elected as prime minister. \nIt was indeed a bruising night for Dutton, a 54-year-old political veteran who also lost his parliamentary seat of 24 years to a candidate from Albanese's Labor Party. \nThis is a big win for the prime minister, who made a surprising comeback to secure a comfortable majority for a second term. But it's an even bigger loss for Dutton and his Liberal National Coalition. \nDutton initially seemed to have an advantage over the incumbent PM who was battling a cost-of-living crisis and dismal ratings. But that advantage vanished as the campaign wore on, ending in a humiliating defeat.\nAn awkward and inconsistent campaign that did not do enough to reassure voters was partly to blame. But there is no mistaking the big part played by what some have called the \"Trump effect\". \nDutton, whether he liked it or not, was a man who many saw as Australia's Trump - but as it turns out Australians do not appear to want that. \nDutton's brand of hard-line conservatism, his support for controversial immigration policies \u2013 like sending asylum seekers to offshore detention centres \u2013 and his fierce criticism of China, all led to comparisons with US President Donald Trump.\nIt's a likeness he has rejected but then the Coalition pursued policies that seemed to have been borrowed from the Trump administration.\nDutton said that if elected he would cut public sector jobs - more than 40,000 by some estimates. This reminded voters of billionaire Elon Musk's Doge, or Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed US bureaucracy. Dutton later walked back the plan. \nThe Coalition even appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency. And images of her wearing a cap with the words Maga - short for the popular Trump slogan, Make America Great Again - have become a key talking point.  \nNone of this served Dutton well and he knew it. Towards the end of the campaign, he tried to shake off Trump's shadow, and in the final leaders' debate he repeatedly told the audience that he didn't know Trump before attempting to answer questions on him.\n\"The Coalition will probably regret issuing messages that came across as supporting Trump and opposing the US Democrats,\" said Frank Mols, a political science lecturer at the University of Queensland. \n\"Once the stock markets started to drop in response to the uncertainty created by the [Trump's] tariffs, it became harder for the Coalition to profile itself as a safer pair of hands for the economy.\"\nThe talk of trade wars and tariffs increased voters' worries. Speaking to people across Australia \u2013 the BBC travelled to Perth in Western Australia and Melbourne in the final week of campaigning \u2013 it was clear that global politics only became more important through the campaign.\nAustralia has long balanced its military alliance with the US and its economic relationship with China, its biggest trading partner. \nBut a US-China trade war, along with an unpredictable White House, is tricky territory for any country - even a US ally like Australia. \nCould Dutton provide stability in these unusual times?  \nDutton had long tried to convince voters that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with Trump. He often cited his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term.\nBut in the end voters weren't convinced. \nDutton's own inconsistent policies and the Trump-esque rhetoric and decisions appear to have driven away an electorate that is deeply concerned about a new, tumultuous world order.\n\"Our message was confusing... Labor had a tight and very disciplined campaign,\" Jitendra Prasad, a LNP supporter, told the BBC as he was about to leave the watch party on Saturday night after a disappointing outcome. \nThat was evident in the swings towards Labor across the country, which led to a fairly quick, emphatic result. \nTowards the end of the campaign, Dutton also embraced the right-wing One Nation Party, which some Coalition members had warned was the wrong move. And it didn't seem to have helped. Rather, it may have hurt him. \n\"They just read the rooms incorrectly,\" says Ben Wellings, associate professor of Politics and International Relations at Monash University.\n\"It was one of the things that we always say about the electorate in Australia  - it's a small C conservative and maybe the radical right message was just in the end, too radical and seemed too disruptive.\"\nWhat also didn't help was that Dutton's was never a smooth campaign. \nThere were gaffes, such as when he accidentally hit a cameraman with a football, and costly missteps, like getting the price of a carton of eggs wrong during an election debate - his guess (A$4.20) was, in fact, half the actual price.\nIt was not a good look in an election where cost-of-living has been a dominant theme.\n\"Dutton has seemed more comfortable attacking Labor than presenting a strong alternative,\" says Jacob Broom, a lecturer in politics and policy at Murdoch University in Perth.\n\"I think it has been effective for Labor to point to the Liberals voting against cost-of-living measures like the tax cuts which they proposed toward the end of the term.\"\nWhile Dutton criticised Labour's tax relief measures and spending, he then announced that he would also effect tax rebates and big spends, including billions to boost defence and fix an ailing public healthcare system.\nBut at the same time he also promised cuts. Analysts say this inconsistency confused voters and became an unfortunate theme in his campaign.\nHe announced and then walked back plans for huge changes to the bureaucracy, including job cuts and the plans to end work from home arrangements. He said it was \"a mistake\".\nBut \"the backflips on working from home and his uncertainty over public service cuts,\" complicated his message, according to John Warhurst, Emeritus Professor, Australian National University.\nThe result, many believe, was the lack of a coherent campaign. \n\"I think people couldn't understand Dutton's policies,\" a member of Dutton's own party in his Dickson constituency told the BBC earlier on Saturday. \nHe wondered if Dutton's support for nuclear energy put people off - an issue that analysts such as Dr Mols said could have worked against him because Australian voters had not \"warmed up\" to the idea of nuclear energy.  \nUltimately, the biggest issue this election - cost-of-living - may have helped Labor cement its message that theirs was the steadier hand. \nEvanthia Smith, another voter in Dutton's Dickson seat, said she voted for Labor because she believed their candidate would do more to improve public education and access to healthcare.\nDutton acknowledged the huge loss the Coalition had faced: \"Our Liberal family is hurting across the country tonight, including in my electorate of Dickson... We'll rebuild from here.\" \nIt was the same advice a supporter in Brisbane had for the party: \"The party needs to go back to the drawing block and look at their policies. We need to focus on the typical issues: Housing, cost-of-living - they are the biggest.\"",

        "article_text": "The Premier League's bottom two meet at King Power Stadium on Saturday, so will Leicester or Southampton manage to pick up a rare victory?\n\"Saints still need a point to beat Robbie Savage's useless Derby side, and avoid a share of the 'worst Premier League team ever' trophy,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"But it says it all about how bad both teams have been this season that I still find it hard to back Leicester, even against them. \n\"The Foxes have not even scored at home in the league since 8 December, but if they can't score there against Southampton then they might as well close the whole club down.\"\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.\nFor week 35, he takes on British-Colombian singer-songwriter Sasha Keable, who supports Arsenal.\nSasha's new single, Act Right, is out now. It has already racked up more than 1.4m views on TikTok.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nKeable was co-signed by Beyonc\u00e9 earlier this year, who named her as an artist who inspired her. She has achieved 2m monthly streams on Spotify and is playing Glastonbury, SXSW, Colors NYC and Meltdown festivals this summer.\nSasha is a singer now but grew up in the centre of the football world - her stepdad, Nick Broad, was head of sports science at Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea, and was working with Carlo Ancelotti as performance manager at Paris St-Germain when he died in a car accident in 2013.\n\"I've seen all sides of football, not just as a fan,\" she told BBC Sport. \"When Carlo got fired by Chelsea, my stepdad was fired too. He didn't know what he was going to do, but then Carlo went to PSG and asked him to go with him.\n\"Sadly he passed away while he was in Paris but we are still close to the Ancelotti family. He and Carlo were such good friends.\n\"I look back now and my stepdad was a real pioneer in his work in sports science and nutrition. The things he introduced, like GPS tracking in training and collecting cardio data, were all new then but they are industry standard now.\n\"It's incredible to see his work live on in that way. Some of his old friends and colleagues reach out to me now when they see me doing my own thing on social media and talk about how his work was incredible. \n\"I always wonder how much further he could have pushed the use of science in football if he was still here, but I'm so pleased you can still see his legacy.\"\nNick Broad (right) celebrates with Carlo Ancelotti (centre) after Chelsea's FA Cup win in 2010, which completed a double of Premier League and FA Cup that season\nBefore becoming a singer, Sasha dreamed of being a footballer herself. Now she settles for collecting shirts instead, with a Tino Asprilla Colombia shirt from 1994 taking pride of place.\n\"I played all the time when I was a kid, from the age of about six,\" explained Sasha.\n\"It was a bit different for girls then because it was before the women's game really took off and you didn't really have a route to becoming a professional in this country. I wanted to go to the United States to play. \n\"I was quite a tomboy so I used to play with the boys all the time - I had to. We did not even have a girls team at my school until my friends and I asked to play with the boys and, after that, they formed a team for us.\n\"Fortunately it's all changed now and football is so much more accessible for girls. If you don't have the chance to try something, how do you know if you will love it?\"\nChris Sutton and Sasha Keable were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nEtihad Stadium, 20:00 BST\nThis should be a great game, because Wolves are so powerful and they will have no fear at all after winning six games in a row.\nBut Manchester City have looked much more solid in the past few weeks and they are on a bit of a roll themselves, with four successive wins in all competitions.\nPep Guardiola's side will look to control this game, the same way they did in the first half of their FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest, but I don't think they will find it easy to keep Wolves quiet.\nStill, I went against City in their last home game, against Aston Villa, and I was wrong. I am not going to make the same mistake again.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: This is a tough game for City but I still think they will win. 2-1\nVilla Park, 12:30 BST\nIt would be easy to say the wheels have come off at Aston Villa, wouldn't it? \nIn the past couple of weeks, they have gone out of the Champions League and FA Cup, and losing their last Premier League game has left them playing catch-up in the top-five race.\nI don't think Unai Emery's side will crumble from here, though, even if Marcus Rashford's season-ending injury is a big blow.\nVilla need to win this, and they also need a big performance from Ollie Watkins. If he starts banging the goals in again then that would be a huge boost for their run-in.\nFulham are a nightmare to predict, as I've mentioned in previous weeks, and they are certainly capable of getting something here.\nI don't think Villa can keep a clean sheet - which probably means they will stop Fulham scoring - but I have a feeling things will click for them in front of goal.\nAlso, they are at home too so, if they need them, their fans can help to get them over the line.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nSasha's prediction: I want to back Fulham here, for south-west London. 0-3\nGoodison Park, 15:00 BST\nI am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live and I am really looking forward to going to Goodison Park again.\nEverything points towards a home win, despite Everton losing their previous two games. \nIpswich are definitely down now and, while they won't throw in the towel, they might be a little less spirited now they know they are relegated.\nTheir confidence has been sapped over the course of the season and, after watching them recently, I can't back them to get anything here. \nThey were flimsy against Arsenal, then well beaten by Newcastle, and it would be a shock if they scored at all, let alone break my record for the fastest goal scored by an away player at Goodison.\nEverton have stuttered in the past couple of weeks but I don't think that is a bad thing for David Moyes. \nHe has over-achieved since taking charge in January, when the reality is that he has got the same group of players as his predecessor, Sean Dyche, and there needs to be a lot of work done on improving that squad in the summer.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I am not sure if Ipswich will put up as much of a fight now they are relegated. 1-0\nKing Power Stadium, 15:00 BST\nLeicester have been rotten but, somehow, Southampton have been even worse.\nIt's sad to see Jamie Vardy leaving the Foxes at the end of the season, but maybe this might be the send-off he deserves. I am going with him to score the winner.\nThese two teams actually served up a thriller at St Mary's Stadium back in October, when Vardy got one of Leicester's goals as they fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\nI am expecting the same outcome here, just with a lot less excitement. The readers will go for a draw, I am sure of it, but I am pretty confident about Leicester taking this one.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nSasha's prediction: It's mad how bad both these teams have been. I don't think either of them will get a goal, let alone the win. 0-0\nEmirates Stadium, 17:30 BST\nWe know how dangerous Bournemouth are, because they beat Arsenal in October, and if Mikel Arteta rests players then this game becomes even harder for the Gunners.\nIt's a tricky situation for Arteta, because he will want to head to Paris St-Germain for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with a bit of momentum, but he has got to balance that with the risk of injury to his key players.\nBournemouth's form has improved of late, and the circumstances mean they definitely have a decent chance of doing the double over Arsenal this season.\nThis all boils down to what the Arsenal team is, so it is difficult to make a call without knowing that, but they are at home and even if they are not at full strength then I can still see them getting a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's a strange situation for Arsenal but I am still backing us to win. 2-0\nGtech Community Stadium, 14:00 BST\nWe know Manchester United are going to make changes here, because seeing out the second leg of their Europa League semi-final with Athletic Bilbao is their priority.\nRuben Amorim's side nicked a point at the very end of their game at Bournemouth last weekend, which sparked mass celebrations, but I really don't see them doing the same against Brentford - they won't be getting the bunting out this time.\nThe Bees are such a dangerous team when they come forward and they will keep on attacking United. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa should get plenty of chances and I can see them getting a goal or two between them.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I just have a feeling United will nick this. 0-1\nAmex Stadium, 14:00 BST\nBrighton got back to winning ways last weekend thanks to Carlos Baleba's brilliant late strike against West Ham.\nThe Seagulls beat Newcastle at St James' Park earlier in the season too, but that was before Eddie Howe's side hit their stride, and it is a big ask for Brighton to repeat that result.\nNewcastle were just relentless in their win over Ipswich and another three points here would be massive in their bid for a top-five finish - I don't think they will get them, but we will see a few goals.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2\nSasha's prediction: Newcastle will take this one. 0-2\nLondon Stadium, 14:00 BST\nThis is 17th versus 16th in the Premier League which tells you how bad both teams have been this season.\nEveryone knows Tottenham's focus will be on their Europa League semi-final second leg with Bodo/Glimt so I think West Ham boss Graham Potter needs a result here more than Ange Postecoglou.\nPotter's results have been poor since he took over from Julen Lopetegui in January and the Hammers fans have not had the upturn they wanted in the way their team play either.\nSpurs can still be dangerous even when they are out of form but Ange is not going to pick his strongest team. That gives West Ham a better chance of getting the win they badly need, but I don't see them doing it in style.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: I don't want to say Tottenham will win, but I think they will. 1-2\nStamford Bridge, 16:30 BST\nI would usually be asking which Chelsea side will turn up, but that applies to Liverpool too this week.\nArne Slot's side could have been out all week celebrating their title win and we don't know how that will affect them.\nYou often play at your best when you have been on the lash in a scenario like theirs. For example, some of my best games for Celtic came after nights out where we had won something and were allowed to have a couple of beers, but I don't know what to expect here.\nChelsea have nicked a couple of results recently, to stay in the race for the top five, but their performances have not been too convincing and their fans still don't seem to have taken to Enzo Maresca's playing style.\nThis is not the test for them that it would be if Liverpool were trying to close out the title but I don't think Slot is the type to let anyone take their foot off the gas. He will put out a strong team and even if they play with more freedom, I still think Liverpool will leave with the points.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nSasha's prediction: I still have a connection with Chelsea because of my stepdad and I have got to back them here. 3-0\nSelhurst Park, 20:00 BST\nCrystal Palace will be on a high after booking their place in the FA Cup final, so this is another very tricky game for Nottingham Forest, who slipped up at home against Brentford on Thursday.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side will have to be stubborn and resolute to get anything at Selhurst Park. They have shown that kind of character plenty of times already this season but they really need it now.\nLooking at the race for the top five you feel like every team involved needs to win every game, but of course that is not going to happen, and I can see my boyhood team Forest dropping more points here. I just hope it doesn't prove crucial for them.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's got to be Palace here. I am loyal to the London teams! 3-0\nChris got five correct results with one exact score from the nine Premier League games he predicted in week 34, giving him a total of 80 points.\nHe beat his guest, golf hero Lee Westwood, who got four correct results with no exact scores, leaving him on 40 points and tied with the BBC readers, who also got five correct results with one exact score.\nWestwood and the BBC readers were wrong about both FA Cup semi-finals, while Chris correctly picked City to beat Forest and wrongly thought Aston Villa would beat Crystal Palace. Those ties do not count towards the weekly totals.\nThe other game from week 34, Manchester City's 2-1 win over Aston Villa, took place on 22 April and does not count towards the weekly result either.\nSherelle, the guest in week 33, made the prediction instead of Westwood and picked up 40 points for the guests' overall total (but not her own individual tally) with an exact score. Chris and the BBC readers both went for a 2-1 Villa win.",

        "article_text": "When Alberto Salagan was deported from the US in January it was the first time he'd stepped foot in Mexico since he was a baby.\nBorn in the coastal resort of Acapulco, his parents took him to the US when he was just six months old.\nGrowing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life.\nAfter his arrest in San Diego for gang activity, Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as President Trump was taking office, and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth.\n\"It was a shock. It still is,\" he admits. \"When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing.\"\n\nAlberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. \"Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],\" he reflects.\nIn fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company \u2013 EZ Call Center \u2013 was looking for English-speakers.\nThe work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved.\n\"I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,\" he tells me during a break between calls.\nAlmost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz.\nHe was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico.\n\"We are all dealing with culture shock,\" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls.\n\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"\nIn their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.\nAll the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.\nDaniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.\n\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.\nDaniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.\nAs well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.\nAfter his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".\nHe has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.\nMexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.\nSo far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing. \nThe latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year. \nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.\nHowever, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.\nThe threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.\nThe Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.\nStill, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.\nThe few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.\nBeyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce. \nWith its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.\n\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"\nNora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.\n\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.\nThe \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.\nHe grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.\n\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence. I was a lifer in California state prison,\" Luis explains.\nWhile in prison in California, he enrolled for every educational programme available and worked hard on his rehabilitation. On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.\nNow 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.\n\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"\nFor Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.\n\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.\nWhile the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.\nIf so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes.\nIn Tijuana, many of them will find it at the end of a telephone line.",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nChampions League highlights: Barcelona 3-3 Inter Milan\nEvery once in a while, a match comes along that will live in the memory long past the final whistle.\nA treat, a feast of football. That is what Barcelona and Inter Milan served up in an enthralling 3-3 draw in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.\n\"It was an amazing battle to watch, almost like a boxing match where opposing styles make the fight,\" said former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock.\n\"Barca and Inter were set up very differently, and it made for one heck of a game.\"\nFormer Rangers striker Ally McCoist said on TNT Sport: \"Tonight was just special, special to be here to watch those two teams.\n\"We have been treated to some unbelievable football this evening.\"\nSensational goals, high drama and incredible individual performances - it had everything. Here's how an engrossing evening of football unfolded.\nMuch of the talk in the build-up to this match was around Barcelona.\nTheir dangerous high line, their ability to score an abundance of goals with a prolific front three, the prospect of another golden generation of players nurtured from their prestigious La Masia academy.\nAfter 30 seconds of the first leg at the Montjuic Olympic Stadium, that all changed.\nMarcus Thuram's clever backheel finish was the fastest goal to be scored in a Champions League semi-final and left the home crowd stunned.\nBut against a side capable of scoring lots of goals, Inter knew one would not be enough and the second came on 21 minutes when Denzel Dumfries fired in a remarkable overhead kick to once again silence the home crowd.\nThat was not in the script for a Barcelona side trying to reach the Champions League final for the first time in 10 years.\n\"I think everyone thought that once Inter went 2-0 up, that would be it \u2013 they would shut up shop, and we wouldn't see much other than another outstanding defensive display by them,\" said Warnock.\nInter had conceded just five goals in this season's Champions League and with Barcelona's high-line tactics exposing their own defensive weaknesses, the Serie A side were able to take advantage.\nFor a few minutes, at least.\nTrailing by two after 21 minutes, Barcelona needed an immediate spark.\nEnter Lamine Yamal.\nThe teenager, making his 100th club appearance, took just three minutes to step up for his team and conjure a moment of magic to get them back in it.\nJinking into the penalty box and leaving Henrikh Mkhitaryan in his wake, Yamal struck a majestic left-footed finish that ricocheted off the post and into the net to launch the comeback.\n'Get the ball to Yamal' became a clear tactic for Barcelona and watching him take control of the game, pinging balls into the area and constantly making himself available in forward positions, it was easy to forget he is still just 17 years old.\nThe equaliser came on 38 minutes, when Ferran Torres stabbed in from close range after Raphinha nodded on Pedri's diagonal cross.\nParity restored just in time for the break, the anticipation was heavy after what had been a mesmerising opening 45 minutes.\nFormer Liverpool player Steve McManaman, part of the TNT punditry team, said: \"It had everything. It showed how frail Barcelona are defensively, but going forward they are electric.\"\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nThis video can not be played\nYamal pulls one back against Inter\nWith fans and neutrals alike on the edge of their seats from this gripping encounter, expectations were high for an equally entertaining second half.\nAfter three stunning goals worthy of putting any team in the Champions League final, there was almost an air of disappointment when Inter's goal to restore their advantage came from a simple corner routine.\nDumfries rose highest to meet Hakan Calhanoglu's corner at the back post, highlighting Barca's defensive struggles.\n\"Inter are not the most dynamic team, and they don't have much raw pace but there was still a way for them to hurt Barca, on the break or with set-pieces,\" said Warnock.\n\"They are the oldest squad in the Champions League so there is a lot of experience there and they showed that tonight with the way they were clever enough to keep opening Barca up.\"\nAt 30 years and 56 days, Inter named the seventh oldest starting XI for a Champions League semi-final game and they used all of that experience to keep cool heads in a high-drama scenario.\n\"When you play at home like we did, the sensation is that we should have managed to earn a better result,\" Barcelona forward Raphinha told Movistar Plus.\n\"We can't concede that many goals, especially at home. Sure, you have to give praise to our opponents who are strong and played well tonight but we are Barca and it's our duty to win at home, that's how it is.\"\nSmarting from three consecutive defeats in the past seven days, where they have dropped to second in Serie A and gone out of the Coppa Italia to city rivals AC Milan, Inter were determined not to let the lead slip away again.\n\"Barca were set up to attack and take the game to Inter but their high-line left them vulnerable at the back,\" said Warnock.\n\"They are not going to change that way of playing - they haven't changed all season and they have done well doing it, so why would they?\"\nConceding three goals at home and facing the prospect of travelling to the San Siro with a one-goal deficit, sometimes all you need is someone to take a chance.\nThat is what Raphinha did when he picked up the ball 25 yards out and hammered the ball into the back of the net, via a touch off the bar and goalkeeper Yann Sommer's back.\nInter had held the lead for all of 114 seconds before Raphinha's equaliser drew Barcelona level for the second time in the game.\nYamal might have been the star of the show on Wednesday but it is Raphinha who has dominated the headlines for Barca throughout this campaign and, although the goal has not been credited to the Brazilian, his performances throughout have proved pivotal to their success.\n\"I really appreciate what we did today,\" said Barcelona boss Hansi Flick.\n\"We played a great game, and of course, the goals we conceded weren't pretty. You have to talk about them, analyse them, but the way we played, our style, our way of playing...it was fantastic.\"\nMkhitaryan thought he had found a fourth goal when he poked home in the 75th minute only for the video assistant referee to rule it out for an agonisingly tight offside.\nBut even without that, the game was the joint-highest score draw in a Champions League semi-final game alongside a 3-3 draw between Dynamo Kyiv and Bayern Munich in the first leg in 1998-99.\nIt sets up a mouth-watering second leg in Milan next week and, while Barca may be disappointed to have conceded three goals at home, the visitors will take confidence that they were able to match them on an exhilarating night of football.\n\"After three defeats in a row we saw the real Inter tonight,\" said Inter goalscorer Dumfries. \n\"We played with heart and I'm proud. Obviously we wanted to win but I think it was a good performance and it's still all to play for.

On Friday the Red Cross said the humanitarian response in Gaza was on the verge of \"total collapse\".\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 52,418 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nAdditional reporting by Tom Bateman, Alice Cuddy and BBC Verify",

The narrative [of Postecoglou's job being under threat] is something we players are trying to keep away from because it's not healthy.\n\"I just know that I come into work every day and see the lads listening and taking on the messages on how he wants us to play and doing the best for this club and we are in a real good position in Europe, where we can still have a special season under his management.\n\"I will continue to do that until the day he isn't here.\"\nSpurs will be without captain Son Heung-min, who is unavailable with a foot injury, against Bodo/Glimt but Maddison says the club are going to \"relish the challenge\" of reaching a first European final since they were beaten by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League showpiece.\n\"It's huge,\" the England midfielder added. \n\"When you get to the end of your career and you look back, there's not many times a player has been in European semi-finals. Maybe once or twice if you are lucky.\n\"We need to use that. We are in the final four in a massive competition in Europe and use that to have a great tie on Thursday and in Bodo as well.\n\"We've got a real special opportunity. There's obviously been a lot of talk about form and being a poor season, but we have the opportunity to do something very special. \n\"We've earned it and we deserve to be here. It is a challenge we are going to relish.\"\nBodo/Glimt chiefs calm on Knutsen future amid Leeds links\nChelsea keen on Rogers - Wednesday's gossip\nAnge Postecoglou signed James Maddison from Leicester City in June 2023\nBodo/Glimt reached the semi-finals with victory over Lazio on penalties in the last round and Postecoglou has dismissed his side's tag as favourites.\n\"Bodo are there on merit,\" said the Australian manager.\n\"They are there because they are a good football team. It doesn't matter where you come from. I come from the other side of the world where football is the fourth sport, so I don't underestimate anyone.\n\"You say they are a small club and we are big club, it doesn't matter. We are two clubs in the semi-final of a European competition and they have earned the right to be there.\n\"They have done very well to get there and we are going to treat them with the respect they deserve. At the same time, make sure we go in there and give it our best performance.\"\nThe 59-year-old also says Tottenham's success in Europe is being \"diminished\" by some people amid the backdrop of their league form.\nHe added: \"I am really strong at the moment on the parallel worlds we are trying to traverse and I have sensed, which is not surprising because this is the way this club is perceived, people are almost trying to diminish it in some respects.\n\"I have seen some people saying it is the equivalent of Manchester United winning the FA Cup, no. Not on any planet is it equivalent. That is suggesting that maybe we are not worthy of Champions League.\n\"Things are there that are designed to diminish what is ahead of us, which is an unbelievable opportunity. Irrespective of how this season has gone, we have generations of fans who want this more than anything else - to share this with the people that they love, a special moment supporting their football club.\n\"We could be flying in the league, but it wouldn't make this opportunity any different. The opportunity is the same and I have made that clear to the players.\"",

The second McLaren of Lando Norris was third ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, just 0.055secs behind his team-mate.\nAntonelli's team-mate George Russell was fifth fastest, 0.309secs slower than the Italian rookie.\nIt was an outstanding performance from Antonelli, the first time he has beaten Russell in qualifying this season, and the first time he has shown a glimpse of the huge potential Mercedes believed they saw in him when they chose him to replace Lewis Hamilton for this year.\n'Not nice' to see Hamilton struggling - Russell\nAntonelli ready for 'big responsibility' of replacing Hamilton\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nAntonelli has taken a steady approach to the start of his career before this weekend, keen not to make a big mistake that could hurt his weekend.\nBut at the Hard Rock Stadium he looked sure-footed and accomplished from the start of practice and carried that form into qualifying.\n\"I am over the moon,\" he said. \"I did not expect it.\n\"I was feeling good in the car. I was able to improve lap by lap and find that consistency and that gap came all together. I am super happy with that. We will enjoy this moment but I want to focus on tomorrow because I really want to try to repeat myself.\"\nAntonelli embraced his father Marco in the Mercedes garage as the team celebrated his achievement wildly.\n\"It was really nice and also to find him in the garage after qualifying,\" Antonelli added.\n\"I am super-happy to share this moment with him. It is so important to me, he is like a rock. I can always rely on him. I would like to share it with my mum and sister as well but hopefully next time.\"\nStarting the sprint from pole gives him a big opportunity to convert it into a first win, given the power of clear air in F1.\nThis video can not be played\nFive things to watch at Miami Grand Prix\nAntonelli's previous highest grid position this season was fifth.\nPiastri, 10 points ahead of Norris in the championship heading into this weekend, said he believed a lock-up at the last corner on his final lap had cost him pole.\nNorris, who crashed in qualifying at the last race in Saudi Arabia, said: \"Close qualifying. It felt good, happy just to get a good lap in there.\n\"Today's performance was in a good ballpark, not good enough but shows how close it is and how quick the Mercedes are. Close enough that we can still aim for a pole tomorrow.\"\nAntonelli's impressive 0.309secs margin over Russell came despite the Briton joining Verstappen in being the only driver to use two sets of tyres over two runs in the final session. Everyone else waited in the pits while they went out and did just one lap.\nThe idea behind the strategy, which is tight in terms of planning because of the fast turnaround needed in the pits after the first lap, is to allow the driver to record a 'banker' lap and then go all out on the second.\nBut it worked for neither. Russell did not improve on his second lap, and while Verstappen did, he was 0.255secs slower than Antonelli and 0.21secs off Piastri.\nVerstappen, who arrived in Miami late following the birth of his first child, said: \"What we did in Q3 was good, the tyres are holding on quite well, but from P1 struggling with a lot of understeer in the car and with all the low-speed corners, you lose quite a bit of lap time.\"\nHis lack of pace came despite a new floor this weekend as the team seek improved performance.\nVerstappen added: \"In the first sector we were quite competitive because that's where a few high-speed corners are but as soon as you get to the low speed we lack quite a bit of grip. P4 is all right, you have to be realistic with the limitations we have at the moment and it was still quite close.\"\nRussell said: \"Massive congrats to Kimi. He did an amazing job. He has been really quick all day, really impressive.\n\"I have been struggling a little bit, not that comfortable, and we wanted to go early because I didn't have that confidence. P5 is not great but amazing (result) for Kimi and the team.\"\nHamilton, who won the first sprint of the season in China from pole position, was seventh fastest, one place behind team-mate Charles Leclerc. It was an improvement for Hamilton after a dire past three races, but he was still 0.222secs off his team-mate.\nNeither Ferrari driver was happy. \"It was a better session,\" Hamilton said, \"but we are just lacking speed. Keep working on it.\"\nWilliams' Alex Albon, Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso completed the top 10, only the second time the two-time champion's team has made it that high up this season, after team-mate Lance Stroll achieved it in the sprint in China.\nAlbon's team-mate Carlos Sainz should also have been in the top 10 but he made a mistake on his final lap in the second session and will line up 15th.\nVerstappen's team-mate Yuki Tsunoda was knocked out in the first session and will start the sprint 18th.\nThe Japanese complained of being held up by a car coming out of the pits on his first lap, and he did not get around his warm-up lap in time to complete a second run.\nFernando Alonso was among those to congratulate Max Verstappen on the birth of his daughter Lily\nThe youngest driver to take pole position for a full grand prix is Sebastian Vettel, at the 2008 Italian GP at Monza when he was 21 years and two months old\nMcLaren's Piastri fastest in Miami practice\n'It's so bad' - who has got their Miami GP livery right?\nWhat is the format for F1 sprint races in 2025?\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions\nMiami Grand Prix preview",

        "article_text": "Businesses are bracing for possible impact after neighbours India and Bangladesh  recently imposed tit-for-tat trade restrictions after months of verbal sparring.\nLast month, Bangladesh restricted land imports of cotton yarn from India to shield local industries from cheaper imports. \nDhaka's move came days after India abruptly stopped the transhipment facility it had offered Bangladesh to export its cargoes to third countries via its ports and airports, citing \"congestion\".\nRelations between the countries have soured since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August after massive protests. She is currently in exile in India and an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is in charge.\nSince then Dhaka has demanded Hasina be extradited to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her, and Delhi has not officially reacted to the demand.\nIndia has also frequently criticised reports of attacks on the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh. It recently said the alleged killing of a Hindu community leader \"reflects a pattern of systematic persecution under the interim government\".\nBangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation, denies targeting minorities, calling most incidents politically motivated or ordinary crimes. Hindus make up less than 10% of its 170 million population.\nAs the countries spar, firms are counting the cost.\nYarn, vital for Bangladesh's clothing factories, can still enter by sea and air - but they are slower and costlier routes.\nIn 2024, India had exported $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn) worth of cotton yarn to Bangladesh, a third of it via land ports.\nThe now-halted transhipment facility let Bangladeshi exporters send clothes made for high-end brands by road to Indian cities, from where it would be flown to Europe and the US.\n\"It's a blow [to Bangladesh's fast-fashion export industry],\" says Anis Ahmed, head of supply chain firm MGH Group, which ships for European fast-fashion brands. \"The India route got cargo to Western countries in a week. By sea, it takes up to eight weeks.\"\nBangladesh, the world's second-largest garment exporter after China, shipped $38bn in clothing last year. Over $1bn of this moved via the India land-air route, which Ahmed says was thriving.\nLimited air freight capacity and under-equipped airports hamper direct exports from Bangladesh.\nMany see Delhi's withdrawal of the transhipment facility as a response to remarks by Yunus during a recent China visit.\nHe had called Bangladesh the \"only guardian of the ocean\" for India's landlocked north-east and suggested that the region could become an \"extension of the Chinese economy.\"\nLeaders from India's north-eastern states called the comments \"offensive\".\nYunus's remarks, spotlighting India's strategic vulnerability in the region to China, raised alarms in Delhi.\nIndia's north-east is linked to the mainland by the 20km-wide Siliguri Corridor - dubbed the \"chicken's neck\" - flanked by Nepal and Bangladesh and close to Tibet's Chumbi Valley.\nWith a history of border tensions and having lost a war in 1962, Indian defence planners fear that China could target the corridor to cut off the north-eastern states from the rest of the country in any future conflict.\nBangladeshi analysts say Yunus's remarks were misinterpreted and aimed at promoting regional connectivity.\nDuring his China visit, Dhaka also welcomed Beijing's interest in a $1bn Teesta River project in northern Bangladesh.\nIndian analysts warn that Chinese involvement in the project, which is not far from the strategic Siliguri Corridor, could unsettle Delhi.\nBut there is concern on both sides over the frosty ties.\nResentment is growing in Bangladesh over tightened Indian visa rules, with approvals plunging since Hasina was driven from power. Previously, two million Bangladeshis visited India yearly for tourism, business, education and medical care. The number of visas issued daily has dropped by over 80% in the past few months according to local media.\nHasina's stay in India and the extradition demand remains a big irritant.\n\"They should realise that there is no way that we can just hand Hasina to them. We know what will happen to her if she's handed over. I think public opinion in India would not countenance that,\" says Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary.\nAmid rising tensions, India's clothing manufacturers' association has called for a ban on Bangladeshi garment imports via land. Bangladeshi analysts warn that more trade barriers would be counter-productive.\n\"I think there is a strong view nowadays in Bangladesh that we should also reassess the other transit and transhipment facilities given to India [for its north-eastern states] by the earlier [Hasina] government,\" Debapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka, tells the BBC.\nIndia uses Bangladeshi ports, roads and waterways to transport goods to its landlocked north-east, cutting distance, time and costs. However, officials say transit volumes haven't reached expected levels.\nDelhi-Dhaka tensions are rising amid growing ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan.\nBangladesh, once East Pakistan, fought for independence in 1971 with Indian support. Hasina distanced herself from Pakistan during her 15-year rule.\nPakistan's Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch visited Dhaka last month, the first such visit in 15 years. A planned visit by Pakistan Deputy PM Ishaq Dar was postponed due to tensions between Delhi and Islamabad over the deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir last week.\n\"I don't think there is any concern over Dhaka's reachout to Pakistan. If there is any suggestion that there is an intent to work together and make things difficult for India, then that will obviously cause concern,\" says Saran, the former Indian diplomat.\nSharp official reactions from both sides are also influencing public opinion in India and Bangladesh. There is a growing anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh, with Indian media accused of exaggerating the attacks on minorities and Islamist threats.\nThe people-to-people ties built over years seem to be on the retreat, and analysts point out that if both sides fail to stay calm, their actions could harm trade and economic relations.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

        "article_text": "In Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.\nPeople here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.\nIn recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.\n\"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic \u2026 Trump's the best thing America ever had.''\nOther spectators are more nuanced.\n\"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\"\nAustralia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency \u2013 and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.\nBut Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world. \nTrump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' \u2013 a value that embodies friendship and loyalty \u2013 and that extends to politics too.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.\nAll of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?\nIn the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.\n\"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\"\nThe US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China \u2013 and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.\nThe rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.\nIt's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.\nBack in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.\n\"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that \u2026 we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\"\nAustralia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.\nA blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.\n\"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\"\nWhile only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.\n\"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\"\nAnd, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.\n\"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\"\nA poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.\nAnd a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.\nBig questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.\nDutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.\n\"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\"\nDutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker \u2026 a big thinker.\"\nAnd he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.\nAlbanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.\nThat may turn out to be in his favour.\nIndeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.\nFor Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.\n\"What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,\" he says. \n\"The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \"\nBut whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.\n\"We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,\" says Andrews. \"I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism \u2013 so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.\"\nBack at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos \u2013 the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground. \nFlying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "article_text": "The top US health department plans to require placebo testing for all vaccines in an effort to offer \"straightforward\" public health information, but experts say such testing could limit availability and raise ethical concerns. \nIn a statement first given to the Washington Post, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said this week, \"All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure \u2014 a radical departure from past practices\". \nThe agency did not provide details on which \"new vaccines\" would be included. \nBut officials have suggested that updated Covid-19 shots may be included, which vaccine experts say could slow down vaccine access.  \nPeter Lurie, a former official with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said \"it's hard to tell exactly what is being proposed.\"  \n\"But, broadly, if they mean that every modification to an existing vaccine would require a new placebo-controlled trial, they are treading in ethically dubious territory and likely to deny Americans life-saving vaccines at some point.\"\nHHS has not offered details on the timing of the placebo plan or specify the vaccines involved. \nAn HHS spokesperson told the BBC in a statement that health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's goal of \"radical transparency\" means being \"honest and straightforward about what we know \u2014 and what we don't know \u2014 about medical products, including vaccines\". \nThe statement said none of the childhood vaccines recommended in the US  - except the Covid shot - had undergone \"inert placebo\" testing, meaning \"we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products\". \nBut public health experts say the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including ones for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio and the mumps, were all initially tested against a placebo. In fact, all new immunizations already go through the trials - a type of random testing where one test group receives the immunization, and the other gets a placebo, like a saline shot. \nBut newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process, because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group, and because the shot is only being tweaked in a minor way, vaccine experts said. \nThe coronavirus shot, for example, already has gone through rigorous safety testing, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\"We have a lot of information about the safety of the vaccine,\" he said. \"All we're doing this year is using a different Omicron variant that we used last year and the year before that.\" \nStill, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said this week that the agency was \"taking a look\" at updated coronavirus shots, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News that there is a \"void of data\". \nAn HHS spokesperson told the BBC that \"significant updates to existing vaccines\" may be considered \"new products\" requiring additional clinical evaluation.\n\"A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years,\" the spokesperson said. \nRequiring companies to conduct placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly - and the drug makers could ultimately decide to forgo making the newer, more effective versions of the vaccine altogether, said Dr Lurie.\nBefore taking office - and since assuming the role as secretary - Kennedy has spread   false claims about vaccine safety. His tenure has coincided with one of the worst measles outbreaks in a decade; two children have died and 660 people have been infected in Texas. \nThis week, he encouraged parents to \"do their own research\" about the measles vaccine - which has been considered safe and 97% effective for decades - and raised questions about whether the shot could cause seizures or neurological issues. \nFor months, he has at times endorsed the MMR shot, and at other times, called it a \"personal\" decision. Kennedy also promoted alternative treatments, which doctors say patients should not use without medical supervision. ",

She was studying it, and then said 'it's OK dad, I don't think they can see me crying'.\n\"That's all she was worried about.\"\nRory McIlroy beat Justin Rose in a dramatic play-off to win the Masters in April\nFor years, McIlroy had faced questions over whether he could complete the career Grand Slam.\nThere had been missed opportunities to claim the iconic green jacket - most notably after an infamous final-round collapse in 2011. \nDespite his talent and self belief, the 35-year-old admitted to wondering if he had missed his opportunity.\n\"You start to think if it is ever going to be your time,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a good message in there about never giving up and keep coming back. \n\"Be strong, be resilient and that patience paid off.\"\nThe Northern Irishman held a two-shot lead going into the final round, and said he had learnt lessons from his 2011 collapse, when he let a four-stroke advantage slip away.\n\"I wanted to make everything else irrelevant. I'm not going to look at what my playing partner is doing, I'm not going to look at the leaderboard. \n\"I was going to try and get in my own world. If I can shoot four-under-par, I'm going to win the Masters. \n\"I felt like I lost the Masters in 2011 because I started to look around and started to do maths in my head.\n\"If you give yourself a target and objective, that's all you can do.\"\nSir Elton John wanted to congratulate McIlroy on his Masters success - but he doesn't have a mobile phone\nUnsurprisingly, McIlroy has been contacted by famous people from all walks of life since his win at Augusta.\nHe said he was \"super humbled\" by those who had been in touch, but one famous musician stood out.\nSir Elton John needs little introduction - but there was one little problem.\n\"I actually haven't been able to connect with him yet. His assistant left me a voicemail and said Sir Elton would love to congratulate me in person.\n\"The only problem is he doesn't have a cell phone. They said I might get a call from Windsor in England on a landline, and I was like 'sure!'.\n\"I didn't even know that Elton John knew what golf was, so it's been really cool.\"\nTiger Woods, one of the five other players to complete the Grand Slam, had a simple but very cool message for McIlroy.\n\"Welcome to the club, kid.\"\nMcIlroy and Fallon recreated the famous clip of the golfer when he was eight years old by chipping balls into a washing machine\nMcIlroy's first appearance on a chat show wasn't in the glitz and glamour of New York, but a local TV programme in his native Northern Ireland. \nWhen he was just eight years of age, McIlroy showcased his talents by chipping balls into a washing machine on 'Kelly', replicating what he used to do in his kitchen in Holywood. \nHe recreated that moment with Fallon in a race to three successful chips. The pressure was on, as he had the famous green jacket on. \n\"As the Masters champion I absolutely should not lose to you!\" McIlroy quipped.\nThankfully for McIlroy, he delivered but, in his own words, \"I was better when I was eight!\".\nRory McIlroy is set to make an appearance alongside Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore 2\nHappy Gilmore is one of the most famous sports movies from the 1990s, and is set for a modern-day sequel that will come out later this year. \nIt's a story about an ice hockey player - played by Adam Sandler - who goes on to become the best golfer in the world despite his unique technique and temperament. \nMcIlroy said he was a huge fan of the original, and is set to make a cameo appearance in the upcoming release. \n\"Happy Gilmore was the golf movie for me growing up, I can recite almost every line,\" McIlroy said.\n\"The fact I got the opportunity to do that was awesome and Sandler is the absolute best.\n\"But I'm a much better golfer than I am an actor.\" ",

        "article_text": "The Premier League's bottom two meet at King Power Stadium on Saturday, so will Leicester or Southampton manage to pick up a rare victory?\n\"Saints still need a point to beat Robbie Savage's useless Derby side, and avoid a share of the 'worst Premier League team ever' trophy,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\n\"But it says it all about how bad both teams have been this season that I still find it hard to back Leicester, even against them. \n\"The Foxes have not even scored at home in the league since 8 December, but if they can't score there against Southampton then they might as well close the whole club down.\"\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests.\nFor week 35, he takes on British-Colombian singer-songwriter Sasha Keable, who supports Arsenal.\nSasha's new single, Act Right, is out now. It has already racked up more than 1.4m views on TikTok.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nKeable was co-signed by Beyonc\u00e9 earlier this year, who named her as an artist who inspired her. She has achieved 2m monthly streams on Spotify and is playing Glastonbury, SXSW, Colors NYC and Meltdown festivals this summer.\nSasha is a singer now but grew up in the centre of the football world - her stepdad, Nick Broad, was head of sports science at Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea, and was working with Carlo Ancelotti as performance manager at Paris St-Germain when he died in a car accident in 2013.\n\"I've seen all sides of football, not just as a fan,\" she told BBC Sport. \"When Carlo got fired by Chelsea, my stepdad was fired too. He didn't know what he was going to do, but then Carlo went to PSG and asked him to go with him.\n\"Sadly he passed away while he was in Paris but we are still close to the Ancelotti family. He and Carlo were such good friends.\n\"I look back now and my stepdad was a real pioneer in his work in sports science and nutrition. The things he introduced, like GPS tracking in training and collecting cardio data, were all new then but they are industry standard now.\n\"It's incredible to see his work live on in that way. Some of his old friends and colleagues reach out to me now when they see me doing my own thing on social media and talk about how his work was incredible. \n\"I always wonder how much further he could have pushed the use of science in football if he was still here, but I'm so pleased you can still see his legacy.\"\nNick Broad (right) celebrates with Carlo Ancelotti (centre) after Chelsea's FA Cup win in 2010, which completed a double of Premier League and FA Cup that season\nBefore becoming a singer, Sasha dreamed of being a footballer herself. Now she settles for collecting shirts instead, with a Tino Asprilla Colombia shirt from 1994 taking pride of place.\n\"I played all the time when I was a kid, from the age of about six,\" explained Sasha.\n\"It was a bit different for girls then because it was before the women's game really took off and you didn't really have a route to becoming a professional in this country. I wanted to go to the United States to play. \n\"I was quite a tomboy so I used to play with the boys all the time - I had to. We did not even have a girls team at my school until my friends and I asked to play with the boys and, after that, they formed a team for us.\n\"Fortunately it's all changed now and football is so much more accessible for girls. If you don't have the chance to try something, how do you know if you will love it?\"\nChris Sutton and Sasha Keable were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nMan City 1-0 Wolves\nThis should be a great game, because Wolves are so powerful and they will have no fear at all after winning six games in a row.\nBut Manchester City have looked much more solid in the past few weeks and they are on a bit of a roll themselves, with four successive wins in all competitions.\nPep Guardiola's side will look to control this game, the same way they did in the first half of their FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest, but I don't think they will find it easy to keep Wolves quiet.\nStill, I went against City in their last home game, against Aston Villa, and I was wrong. I am not going to make the same mistake again.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: This is a tough game for City but I still think they will win. 2-1\nAston Villa 1-0 Fulham\nIt would be easy to say the wheels have come off at Aston Villa, wouldn't it? \nIn the past couple of weeks, they have gone out of the Champions League and FA Cup, and losing their last Premier League game has left them playing catch-up in the top-five race.\nI don't think Unai Emery's side will crumble from here, though, even if Marcus Rashford's season-ending injury is a big blow.\nVilla need to win this, and they also need a big performance from Ollie Watkins. If he starts banging the goals in again then that would be a huge boost for their run-in.\nFulham are a nightmare to predict, as I've mentioned in previous weeks, and they are certainly capable of getting something here.\nI don't think Villa can keep a clean sheet - which probably means they will stop Fulham scoring - but I have a feeling things will click for them in front of goal.\nAlso, they are at home too so, if they need them, their fans can help to get them over the line.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nSasha's prediction: I want to back Fulham here, for south-west London. 0-3\nEverton 2-2 Ipswich\nI am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live and I am really looking forward to going to Goodison Park again.\nEverything points towards a home win, despite Everton losing their previous two games. \nIpswich are definitely down now and, while they won't throw in the towel, they might be a little less spirited now they know they are relegated.\nTheir confidence has been sapped over the course of the season and, after watching them recently, I can't back them to get anything here. \nThey were flimsy against Arsenal, then well beaten by Newcastle, and it would be a shock if they scored at all, let alone break my record for the fastest goal scored by an away player at Goodison.\nEverton have stuttered in the past couple of weeks but I don't think that is a bad thing for David Moyes. \nHe has over-achieved since taking charge in January, when the reality is that he has got the same group of players as his predecessor, Sean Dyche, and there needs to be a lot of work done on improving that squad in the summer.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I am not sure if Ipswich will put up as much of a fight now they are relegated. 1-0\nLeicester 2-0 Southampton \nLeicester have been rotten but, somehow, Southampton have been even worse.\nIt's sad to see Jamie Vardy leaving the Foxes at the end of the season, but maybe this might be the send-off he deserves. I am going with him to score the winner.\nThese two teams actually served up a thriller at St Mary's Stadium back in October, when Vardy got one of Leicester's goals as they fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\nI am expecting the same outcome here, just with a lot less excitement. The readers will go for a draw, I am sure of it, but I am pretty confident about Leicester taking this one.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nSasha's prediction: It's mad how bad both these teams have been. I don't think either of them will get a goal, let alone the win. 0-0\nArsenal 1-2 Bournemouth\nWe know how dangerous Bournemouth are, because they beat Arsenal in October, and if Mikel Arteta rests players then this game becomes even harder for the Gunners.\nIt's a tricky situation for Arteta, because he will want to head to Paris St-Germain for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with a bit of momentum, but he has got to balance that with the risk of injury to his key players.\nBournemouth's form has improved of late, and the circumstances mean they definitely have a decent chance of doing the double over Arsenal this season.\nThis all boils down to what the Arsenal team is, so it is difficult to make a call without knowing that, but they are at home and even if they are not at full strength then I can still see them getting a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's a strange situation for Arsenal but I am still backing us to win. 2-0\nGtech Community Stadium, 14:00 BST\nWe know Manchester United are going to make changes here, because seeing out the second leg of their Europa League semi-final with Athletic Bilbao is their priority.\nRuben Amorim's side nicked a point at the very end of their game at Bournemouth last weekend, which sparked mass celebrations, but I really don't see them doing the same against Brentford - they won't be getting the bunting out this time.\nThe Bees are such a dangerous team when they come forward and they will keep on attacking United. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa should get plenty of chances and I can see them getting a goal or two between them.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I just have a feeling United will nick this. 0-1\nAmex Stadium, 14:00 BST\nBrighton got back to winning ways last weekend thanks to Carlos Baleba's brilliant late strike against West Ham.\nThe Seagulls beat Newcastle at St James' Park earlier in the season too, but that was before Eddie Howe's side hit their stride, and it is a big ask for Brighton to repeat that result.\nNewcastle were just relentless in their win over Ipswich and another three points here would be massive in their bid for a top-five finish - I don't think they will get them, but we will see a few goals.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2\nSasha's prediction: Newcastle will take this one. 0-2\nLondon Stadium, 14:00 BST\nThis is 17th versus 16th in the Premier League which tells you how bad both teams have been this season.\nEveryone knows Tottenham's focus will be on their Europa League semi-final second leg with Bodo/Glimt so I think West Ham boss Graham Potter needs a result here more than Ange Postecoglou.\nPotter's results have been poor since he took over from Julen Lopetegui in January and the Hammers fans have not had the upturn they wanted in the way their team play either.\nSpurs can still be dangerous even when they are out of form but Ange is not going to pick his strongest team. That gives West Ham a better chance of getting the win they badly need, but I don't see them doing it in style.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: I don't want to say Tottenham will win, but I think they will. 1-2\nStamford Bridge, 16:30 BST\nI would usually be asking which Chelsea side will turn up, but that applies to Liverpool too this week.\nArne Slot's side could have been out all week celebrating their title win and we don't know how that will affect them.\nYou often play at your best when you have been on the lash in a scenario like theirs. For example, some of my best games for Celtic came after nights out where we had won something and were allowed to have a couple of beers, but I don't know what to expect here.\nChelsea have nicked a couple of results recently, to stay in the race for the top five, but their performances have not been too convincing and their fans still don't seem to have taken to Enzo Maresca's playing style.\nThis is not the test for them that it would be if Liverpool were trying to close out the title but I don't think Slot is the type to let anyone take their foot off the gas. He will put out a strong team and even if they play with more freedom, I still think Liverpool will leave with the points.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nSasha's prediction: I still have a connection with Chelsea because of my stepdad and I have got to back them here. 3-0\nSelhurst Park, 20:00 BST\nCrystal Palace will be on a high after booking their place in the FA Cup final, so this is another very tricky game for Nottingham Forest, who slipped up at home against Brentford on Thursday.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side will have to be stubborn and resolute to get anything at Selhurst Park. They have shown that kind of character plenty of times already this season but they really need it now.\nLooking at the race for the top five you feel like every team involved needs to win every game, but of course that is not going to happen, and I can see my boyhood team Forest dropping more points here. I just hope it doesn't prove crucial for them.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's got to be Palace here. I am loyal to the London teams! 3-0\nChris got five correct results with one exact score from the nine Premier League games he predicted in week 34, giving him a total of 80 points.\nHe beat his guest, golf hero Lee Westwood, who got four correct results with no exact scores, leaving him on 40 points and tied with the BBC readers, who also got five correct results with one exact score.\nWestwood and the BBC readers were wrong about both FA Cup semi-finals, while Chris correctly picked City to beat Forest and wrongly thought Aston Villa would beat Crystal Palace. Those ties do not count towards the weekly totals.\nThe other game from week 34, Manchester City's 2-1 win over Aston Villa, took place on 22 April and does not count towards the weekly result either.\nSherelle, the guest in week 33, made the prediction instead of Westwood and picked up 40 points for the guests' overall total (but not her own individual tally) with an exact score. Chris and the BBC readers both went for a 2-1 Villa win.",

And if that brings us revenue too that's wonderful.\"\nAll national galleries charge for admission to special exhibitions, she added.\nThe gallery has forecast an operating deficit for the latest financial year.\nThe use of the striking paintings and photos with animated graphics, music and narration was a \"powerful combination\", Siddall said.\nThe exhibition is being held in a pop-up venue at MediaCity in Salford until August and will then tour to five more locations, but they have not been announced.\nThe venue's walls are filled with about 40 giant picture frame-style boxes, which the portraits and animations are projected onto.\nSome of the chosen personalities, such as Malala Yousafzai, Churchill and Audrey Hepburn, tell their stories in their own words; while actors narrate the sections about others, including William Shakespeare and Emmeline Pankhurst.\nIt's a whistlestop guide to selected slices of history, with each person's story told in two or three minutes, and the entire show taking about 45 minutes. It ends with Queen Elizabeth II.\nStandard adult tickets cost between \u00a322 and \u00a330, with an extra \u00a35 for a flexible ticket, and some \"affordable\" \u00a310 tickets available on Mondays.\nJoy Coker, editor of arts outlet Alt A Review, said she thought it was worth it, but that the price could exclude some people.\n\"Right now with the cost of living it might not be something everybody can afford,\" she said.\n\"It's thought-provoking and it actually makes you think about each individual subject again, and takes you back to those moments in time, which you're not necessarily going to get from a looking at a portrait on its own.\"\nIn recent years, artists from Vincent van Gogh to David Hockney have successfully been given the immersive treatment.\nThis weekend, LS Lowry will also be added to the list when a new, free immersive experience brings his trademark matchstick men to life at Salford's Lowry arts centre.\nThe walls, floor and ceiling of one gallery show projections of the artist's 1953 painting Going To The Match.

The estimate comes as firms around the world are scrambling to respond to the huge shifts in global trade triggered by Washington's trade policies.On a call with investors on Thursday to discuss the firm's financial performance, the Apple boss seemed keen to draw attention to its investments in the US.Mr Cook opened the discussion with a reminder of the company's plans to invest $500bn across several US states over the next four years.Made in IndiaHe also said Apple is shifting its supply chain for US-bound products away from China, but it is India and Vietnam that are poised to be major beneficiaries of that move. \"We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in US will have India as their country of origin,\" Mr Cook said.Meanwhile, Vietnam will be the chief manufacturing hub \"for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPods product sold in the US\".China will remain the country of origin for the vast majority of total products sold outside the US, he added.However moving production lines to India will take time and significant investment, costing billions of dollars.Shanti Kelemen, chief investment officer at M&G Wealth, told the BBC's Today programme: \"There will still be tariffs that impact the supply chains [for Apple] and a cost to move them and build new factories.",

        "article_text": "President Donald Trump has asked for more time on the US economy as it contracted for the first time in three years, stoking recession fears. \nHe said the figure was misleading because companies had stockpiled imports ahead of his imposition of tariffs. \nTrump, however, said $8tn (\u00a36tn) of inward investment had been promised, which he argued would restore American manufacturing prowess. \nThe US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, the US commerce department said, a sharp downturn after growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. It comes as Trump marks 100 days in office, with opinion polls indicating public discontent over his economic stewardship.\nSpeaking on Wednesday afternoon at a White House event attended by business leaders, Trump blamed his Democratic predecessor, President Joe Biden, for the disappointing gross domestic product data.\n\"This is Biden's economy because we took over on January 20th,\" Trump said. \"I think you have to give us a little bit of time to get moving.\"\nIt comes in the aftermath of the Republican president's import taxes, which have disrupted global trade and markets.  \nTrump's finger pointing at Biden drew scorn from Democrats.\nCongressman Hakeem Jeffries, minority leader of the US House of Representatives, said: \"This is not Joe Biden's economy, Donald, it is your economy.\n\"It is the Trump economy, it is a failed economy and the American people know it.\"\nAt Wednesday's White House event, Trump touted planned investments in technology, healthcare and infrastructure.\nHe introduced CEOs of major companies, including Hyundai's Jose Munoz, Toyota's Ted Ogawa, and Johnson & Johnson's Joaquin Duato.\nTrump also urged Congress to pass his tax bill, which includes trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts, but faces opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.\nAt a television appearance earlier in the day with cabinet members, Trump played down fears of shortages of items such as toys, as trade between the US and China falls sharply.\n\"Well, maybe the children will have to have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know?\" he said. \"And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\"\nTrump has enacted 10% levies on imports to the US from nearly all countries, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. The amount paid by these countries could change after the period expires in July. \nAnother 25% tariff has been imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy.\nTrump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products.\nHis administration said when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "article_text": "Early summer. A Test squad due to be announced. It takes me back to the times I was bowling for a place in the England team.\nI was an international cricketer between 2010 and 2017. At the beginning of each of those summers, there was a mix of optimism, hope and determination that I would bowl well enough in Championship cricket to get the call.\nWickets were the currency. James Anderson and Stuart Broad were inked in the side, so Tim Bresnan, Graham Onions, Chris Tremlett, Chris Woakes, myself and a number of others were competing for the other spot.\nThis bred competition and hunger, because I knew the other guys were trying to do exactly the same thing. Backing up performances and demonstrating the stamina to do it over a number of weeks in the domestic game was another aspect of showing you were hardened for the intensity of international cricket.\nIn recent years, under Rob Key, Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes, the way England select their teams has changed. I wonder if the feelings of the players hoping to be selected, those feelings I remember so well, have changed too.\nThere is still the opportunity for a player to prove himself the 'old school' way, even if it does feel like that is becoming a more difficult route into the England team.\nSam Cook has 318 first-class wickets to his name, at an average of just 19.77\nSam Cook has been the outstanding seam bowler in county cricket for the past number of years. At the age of 27, with 318 first-class wickets at an average of 19.77, it seems as though his time has finally come.\nAfter he was asked to rest from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire a couple of weeks ago, it would be surprising if he is not in the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe next month.\nEven with that overwhelming body of evidence and a stack of wickets behind him, I do feel like it is one performance that has convinced England Cook is finally worth backing.\nAt the beginning of last summer, when the pitches were flat and the Kookaburra ball was being used in the Championship, bowlers toiled. Cook took 10 wickets for Essex to lead them to victory over Nottinghamshire. It is the sort of display that will catch the eye of the selectors, who will rightly look for more than statistics when it comes to making their judgements.\nAnd that, perhaps, is the difference between what I felt I was going through more than a decade ago and what can earn selection at this moment. Now it is far more exciting.\nYes, Cook has an outstanding record, but he also needed that standout display to give Key and company a nudge. In an attack that only has room for one 'English' style seamer, an injury to Woakes has presented an opportunity. And it might actually be one outstanding performance for other England hopefuls that earns them a call-up.\nWood irritated by England's 'golf, golf, golf' narrative\nCook in line for Test call-up as England ask Essex to rest him\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone\nI see bowlers in the domestic game who have the raw materials to be international players. Sonny Baker and John Turner are two of them, both of Hampshire (although Turner has been on loan at Lancashire), and have been identified by England despite having almost no first-class cricket behind them.\nBaker, Turner and others who have the attributes to trouble the best batters will know that one performance, even one spell, might be enough to earn them a call-up. There's precedent for it, too. Stokes first saw off-spinner Shoaib Bashir bowl in a clip on social media, then shared it in his WhatsApp group with Key and McCullum. Not long after, Bashir was in the England squad.\nAnother difference between my time as an international cricketer and now is England's attitude towards franchise cricket, particularly the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nNow there is an acceptance players hold a lot of power and cannot be denied lucrative franchise opportunities. Who can blame the players for this? After all, it can be a short career. \nThis is in contrast to when I wanted to put my name forward for the 2013 IPL auction. I thought I had a good chance of being picked up. I was bowling quickly, had bowled nicely in a white-ball series in India, getting good players out, and had just had a good T20 World Cup.\nAt the end of 2012, we were on the famous Test tour of India, when we won 2-1. I had to ask permission from the England and Wales Cricket Board to enter the auction and, within five minutes of submitting my forms, received an email telling me I wasn't allowed but that Andy Flower, the head coach, would explain why.\nThat evening, I was having room service in the bedroom of Kevin Pietersen (who was the first England player to spot the might of the IPL), along with Eoin Morgan. I was summoned to see Flower and, as I was on the way out of the door, KP told me to tell Flower I was entering the auction whether he liked it or not.\nIt was a short meeting with Flower. He told me I had to be playing county cricket at the beginning of the following summer in order to back-up performances and be in contention to play Test cricket at the beginning of a double Ashes year. I did as I was told. To me, Test cricket was the pinnacle and I would have done anything to get a spot in that England team.\nTimes have changed. How exciting it must be to be a player now with the potential to succeed in international cricket.\nEvery time you walk on to the pitch you feel like you have the opportunity to put your name forward, to be the subject of the next clip in the England management WhatsApp group, with Key and his cohorts thinking 'we can't ignore this, can we?'",

At the age of 27, with 318 first-class wickets at an average of 19.77, it seems as though his time has finally come.After he was asked to rest from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire a couple of weeks ago, it would be surprising if he is not in the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe next month.Even with that overwhelming body of evidence and a stack of wickets behind him, I do feel like it is one performance that has convinced England Cook is finally worth backing.At the beginning of last summer, when the pitches were flat and the Kookaburra ball was being used in the Championship, bowlers toiled. To me, Test cricket was the pinnacle and I would have done anything to get a spot in that England team.Times have changed.

But while access to see the original portraits in the NPG in London is free, entrance to the Stories Brought To Life exhibition costs up to \u00a335.\nNPG director Victoria Siddall told BBC News: \"The main driver of this is taking the collection to new audiences outside of London.\n\"But there is another element to that, of course, which is raising revenue, which is absolutely crucial for museums to thrive.\n\"Obviously we're always looking at new innovations that can help engage audiences. And if that brings us revenue too that's wonderful.\"\nAll national galleries charge for admission to special exhibitions, she added.\nThe gallery has forecast an operating deficit for the latest financial year.\nThe use of the striking paintings and photos with animated graphics, music and narration was a \"powerful combination\", Siddall said.\nThe exhibition is being held in a pop-up venue at MediaCity in Salford until August and will then tour to five more locations, but they have not been announced.\nThe venue's walls are filled with about 40 giant picture frame-style boxes, which the portraits and animations are projected onto.\nSome of the chosen personalities, such as Malala Yousafzai, Churchill and Audrey Hepburn, tell their stories in their own words; while actors narrate the sections about others, including William Shakespeare and Emmeline Pankhurst.\nIt's a whistlestop guide to selected slices of history, with each person's story told in two or three minutes, and the entire show taking about 45 minutes. It ends with Queen Elizabeth II.\nStandard adult tickets cost between \u00a322 and \u00a330, with an extra \u00a35 for a flexible ticket, and some \"affordable\" \u00a310 tickets available on Mondays.\nJoy Coker, editor of arts outlet Alt A Review, said she thought it was worth it, but that the price could exclude some people.\n\"Right now with the cost of living it might not be something everybody can afford,\" she said.\n\"It's thought-provoking and it actually makes you think about each individual subject again, and takes you back to those moments in time, which you're not necessarily going to get from a looking at a portrait on its own.\"\nIn recent years, artists from Vincent van Gogh to David Hockney have successfully been given the immersive treatment.\nThis weekend, LS Lowry will also be added to the list when a new, free immersive experience brings his trademark matchstick men to life at Salford's Lowry arts centre.\nThe walls, floor and ceiling of one gallery show projections of the artist's 1953 painting Going To The Match.

Fawcett said she did not consider charging for entry.\n\"Our galleries are free and this is part of our gallery offer,\" she said. \"For us, it was about making sure we reached the widest possible audience.\n\"We know immersive [art] is popular but we know also that price can be a barrier, and it would be counter-intuitive, when you have a project that is about reaching more audiences and deepening people's love and appreciation of the artist, to put a barrier in place.\"",

They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military technology and infrastructure.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine. \nThe deal will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war. \nAccording to the statement from the US Treasury on Wednesday afternoon, the newly created US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund recognises the \"significant financial and material support\" the US has given Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022. \nThe US treasury secretary said in a video statement that the deal would help \"unlock Ukraine's growth assets\".\nThe language of the announcement shows much more solidarity with Ukraine than is usual for the Trump administration.\nIt refers to \"Russia's full scale invasion\" and adds that \"no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine\".\nThe Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.\nFor Kyiv, it is seen as essential to accessing US military aid.\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington to ink the deal on Wednesday - said in a post on X that the new fund would \"attract global investment into our country\". \nListing the deal's provisions, she said it would involve projects in minerals, oil and gas, although the resources would remain the property of Ukraine.\nThe partnership will be equal, on a 50:50 basis, she added, and must be ratified by lawmakers in Kyiv.\nUnder the deal, the US would contribute new assistance to Kyiv, she added, including, for example, air defence systems.\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for the agreement as a prerequisite to offering any future security guarantees to Kyiv. \nCrucially, the draft of the deal indicates Ukraine will be giving Washington access to some of its natural resources in return for future US security assistance.\nBut that is significantly less than what Trump had wanted, which was to get paid back for all US military aid given since the start of the war.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has managed to eke out some concessions from Washington.\nThe deal was delayed after US authorities said Kyiv was trying to make last-minute changes. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, a US source familiar with the talks criticised Ukraine for seeking to reopen some terms that had apparently been finalised over the weekend.\nThe source said sticking points had included governance of the fund, issues with transparency, and steps to ensure that all funds would be fully traceable.\nTechnical documents were signed last week by representatives of both countries.\nThe initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but fell apart following a heated exchange at the White House when Trump accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\". \nThe breakthrough comes days after Trump and Zelensky held a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, and as talks between Moscow and Washington over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine grind on.\nPhoning into the NewsNation network on Wednesday evening, Trump said he had pressed Zelensky at Vatican City to seal the deal.\n\"I was telling him that it's a very good thing if we can produce a deal that you sign it,\" he said, \"because Russia is much bigger and much stronger. Russia is just chugging forward.\"\nThe US president said the deal would recuperate the multi-billion dollar US assistance to Ukraine since the war began and \"much more in theory\".\n\"So I went to them and said, 'Look, we got to get rare earth.' They have great rare earth, meaning certain minerals, materials,\" said Trump.\n\"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have.\"\nThe agreement comes amid a US trade war with China, where 90% of the world's current rare-earth stocks are sourced.",

        "article_text": "King Charles has sent a personal message to fellow cancer patients, speaking of the \"daunting and at times frightening experience\" for cancer sufferers and their loved ones.\nIn a heartfelt message to guests at a Buckingham Palace reception for cancer charities, the King spoke about becoming a cancer \"statistic\" - referencing the more than 1,000 new cases recorded in the UK every day.\nHe said his experience of living with cancer had shown that \"the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion\".\nThe message doesn't provide an update on the progress of the King's own cancer treatment, but royal sources say he is continuing in a positive direction.\nThe King was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February 2024 and continues to receive regular treatment, which is said to be successful and that he is getting better.\nThere was a brief hospital stay for the King in March after he suffered side effects, but he was well enough in April for a state visit to Italy with a busy schedule and is said to have plans for further overseas trips.\nThere has been an attempt to be more open about his health problems - and this latest message reflects his sense of a shared experience with the many other families affected by cancer.\nThe King's statement continued: \"But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity.\"\nHe praised the \"community of care\" of those who helped cancer patients, for their humanity as well as their expertise.\nThe King highlighted \"the profound impact of human connection - whether in the careful explanation from a specialist nurse, the hand held by a hospice volunteer, or the shared experience in a support group\". \n\"While every patient's journey may be different, together you are ensuring that a cancer diagnosis need never mean facing the future without hope and support,\" said the King.\nHe quoted Dame Deborah James, who died of bowel cancer in 2022, who said: \"Have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope.\"\nHer parents, Alistair and Heather James, were guests at the reception, and said they had only been told \"minutes before\" that the King was going to quote some of their daughter's last words.\n\"It really did make it a special occasion,\" Alistair told BBC Breakfast the morning after the event. His wife, Heather, called it \"an honour\". \n\"He wished he'd met her,\" Heather added while reflecting on her conversation with the King - who she said called their daughter \"obviously a force of nature\".\nThe reception at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening, attended by the King and Queen Camilla, is in honour of community projects helping people who are living with cancer and for health groups trying to prevent cancer.\nAmong the guests will be representatives of cancer charities including Macmillan Cancer Support, Breast Cancer Now, Maggie's and Children's Hospice South West.\nThe reception includes displays showing the work of groups helping people affected by cancer, including Wigs for Heroes and Move Dance Feel, which uses dance to support women with cancer.\nAt the Palace there are also champions of cancer charities, people living with cancer and people who lost relatives, including radio presenter Adele Roberts, former footballer Ashley Cain and actor Richard E Grant.\n\"Every day we see the impact that cancer is having on people's lives and that experience is even worse for some people because of who they are or where they live, which is entirely unacceptable. We are on a mission to transform cancer care, but we cannot do it on our own,\" said Gemma Peters, chief executive officer at Macmillan Cancer Support.\nIf you are affected by any of the issues raised in this story, support and advice is available via the BBC Action Line.\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

King sends heartfelt message to fellow cancer patients6 hours agoShareSaveSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentShareSavePA MediaKing Charles greeted actor Richard E Grant and radio presenter Adele Roberts during the reception at Buckingham PalaceKing Charles has sent a personal message to fellow cancer patients, speaking of the \"daunting and at times frightening experience\" for cancer sufferers and their loved ones.In a heartfelt message to guests at a Buckingham Palace reception for cancer charities, the King spoke about becoming a cancer \"statistic\" - referencing the more than 1,000 new cases recorded in the UK every day.He said his experience of living with cancer had shown that \"the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion\".The message doesn't provide an update on the progress of the King's own cancer treatment, but royal sources say he is continuing in a positive direction.King experiences temporary side effects of cancer treatmentKing returns to public duties after hospital visitKing Charles diagnosed with cancerThe King was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February 2024 and continues to receive regular treatment, which is said to be successful and that he is getting better.There was a brief hospital stay for the King in March after he suffered side effects, but he was well enough in April for a state visit to Italy with a busy schedule and is said to have plans for further overseas trips.There has been an attempt to be more open about his health problems - and this latest message reflects his sense of a shared experience with the many other families affected by cancer.The King's statement continued: \"But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity. \"Her parents, Alistair and Heather James, were guests at the reception, and said they had only been told \"minutes before\" that the King was going to quote some of their daughter's last words.PA MediaKing Charles praised the \"community of care\" of those who helped cancer patientsPA MediaThe parents of the late broadcaster Deborah James were among the guests at the reception\"It really did make it a special occasion,\" Alistair told BBC Breakfast the morning after the event.

He is likely to be joined in the squad by Matthew Potts (10 caps), Josh Tongue (two) and uncapped Essex man Sam Cook.\nA combination in the XI of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook would have 13 caps between them. Not since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago has England's pace attack looked so callow at home, when Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Richard Johnson had a combined seven caps.\nIndeed, England have played only one home Test without any of Woakes, Anderson or Stuart Broad in the past 18 years.\nAlthough Zimbabwe are improving \u2013 they have just earned a creditable 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh \u2013 England will be overwhelming favourites to win the four-day Test when it begins on 22 May.\nFollowing that, the five-match series at home to India and the Ashes away in Australia this winter will shape the leadership legacies of Stokes, coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.\n'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nWe've said naive things, but we do care - Wood\nWoakes has not played yet this season because of an ankle problem, while Wood is out until July following knee surgery.\nBrydon Carse remains sidelined with a foot problem and Olly Stone will not play before the back end of the summer after his own knee operation. Ollie Robinson, who has won 20 Test caps, has not played for England in more than a year and lost his central contract in October.\nAll-rounder Stokes, with 210 Test wickets, has more scalps than any other active England bowler, though his bowling is likely to be restricted. An injury sustained in the third Test against New Zealand in December was the second time in five months the talismanic captain had hurt his left hamstring.\nStokes will look to build his bowling in the run-up to the India series, when England will hope to have Woakes and Carse available. Jofra Archer could play his first red-ball game in four years for England Lions against India A in June. Speaking on Wednesday, Wood did not rule out a return for the conclusion of the India series.\nFor now, Atkinson will lead the attack following his stunning debut year in Test cricket while Potts played in England's last Test in New Zealand.\nTongue has not played for England for two years because of injuries but has enjoyed a superb start to the season with Nottinghamshire.\nCook, 27, has been the outstanding bowler in domestic cricket for some time, grabbing 318 first-class wickets at an average under 20.\nHe is not blessed with high pace and has had to wait for his chance, yet an indication an England call-up was on the horizon came when it was requested he be rested from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire last month.\nIf England feel they want further pace cover in the squad, it could come from 20-year-old left-armer Josh Hull, who made his Test debut last summer, or Hampshire's exciting prospect Sonny Baker. Baker has played only three first-class matches but was given an England development contract in February.\nOther areas of selection look more straightforward. Jamie Smith will return behind the stumps after missing the tour of New Zealand on paternity leave, while there is no suggestion Shoaib Bashir's place as the number one spinner is under threat.\nAny decisions over the top five will be delayed by Jacob Bethell's stint at the Indian Premier League.

They are highly sought after because of their use in renewable energy, military technology and infrastructure.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed both sides were committed to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine. \nThe deal will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war. \nAccording to the statement from the US Treasury on Wednesday afternoon, the newly created US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund recognises the \"significant financial and material support\" the US has given Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022. \nThe US treasury secretary said in a video statement that the deal would help \"unlock Ukraine's growth assets\".\nThe language of the announcement shows much more solidarity with Ukraine than is usual for the Trump administration.\nIt refers to \"Russia's full scale invasion\" and adds that \"no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine\".\nThe Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.\nFor Kyiv, it is seen as essential to accessing US military aid.\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington to ink the deal on Wednesday - said in a post on X that the new fund would \"attract global investment into our country\". \nListing the deal's provisions, she said it would involve projects in minerals, oil and gas, although the resources would remain the property of Ukraine.\nThe partnership will be equal, on a 50:50 basis, she added, and must be ratified by lawmakers in Kyiv.\nUnder the deal, the US would contribute new assistance to Kyiv, she added, including, for example, air defence systems.\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly pushed for the agreement as a prerequisite to offering any future security guarantees to Kyiv. \nCrucially, the draft of the deal indicates Ukraine will be giving Washington access to some of its natural resources in return for future US security assistance.\nBut that is significantly less than what Trump had wanted, which was to get paid back for all US military aid given since the start of the war.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has managed to eke out some concessions from Washington.\nThe deal was delayed after US authorities said Kyiv was trying to make last-minute changes. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, a US source familiar with the talks criticised Ukraine for seeking to reopen some terms that had apparently been finalised over the weekend.\nThe source said sticking points had included governance of the fund, issues with transparency, and steps to ensure that all funds would be fully traceable.\nTechnical documents were signed last week by representatives of both countries.\nThe initial agreement was due to be signed in February, but fell apart following a heated exchange at the White House when Trump accused Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\". \nThe breakthrough comes days after Trump and Zelensky held a face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral, and as talks between Moscow and Washington over a possible ceasefire in Ukraine grind on.\nPhoning into the NewsNation network on Wednesday evening, Trump said he had pressed Zelensky at Vatican City to seal the deal.\n\"I was telling him that it's a very good thing if we can produce a deal that you sign it,\" he said, \"because Russia is much bigger and much stronger. Russia is just chugging forward.\"\nThe US president said the deal would recuperate the multi-billion dollar US assistance to Ukraine since the war began and \"much more in theory\".\n\"So I went to them and said, 'Look, we got to get rare earth.' They have great rare earth, meaning certain minerals, materials,\" said Trump.\n\"They have things that a lot of places don't have. It's a big asset that they have.\"\nThe agreement comes amid a US trade war with China, where 90% of the world's current rare-earth stocks are sourced.",

They announced their engagement in 1998 and married the following year in an Irish castle ceremony featuring golden thrones.\nBeckham has four children - sons Brooklyn (pictured), Romeo and Cruz, and daughter Harper\nAt the 1998 World Cup in France, Beckham was sent off after kicking out at Argentina's Diego Simeone. He became, at the time, only the second player to be sent off for England at a World Cup, after Ray Wilkins received a red card in 1986.\nBeckham delivered both corners from which Manchester United scored twice in injury time to beat Barcelona in the 1999 Champions League final, completing the Treble\nPeter Taylor, although only caretaker manager for one game, gave Beckham the England captaincy in 2000.

Because forward Raul already wore Beckham's famous number seven shirt, the England captain chose the number 23 instead because of his admiration for basketball great Michael Jordan.\nBeckham left Real Madrid for LA Galaxy in 2007, a move which transformed the profile of Major League Soccer (MLS)\nDuring his time at LA Galaxy, Beckham had two loan spells at AC Milan. After a Champions League defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford, Beckham draped a green and gold scarf - symbolic of United fans' protests against the Glazer family's ownership of the club - around his neck. He later said he wasn't aware of the scarf's association with the anti-Glazer campaign.\nHaving been part of the successful bid to bring the 2012 Olympics to London, Beckham played his part in the memorable opening ceremony, driving the speedboat that carried the Olympic flame down the River Thames to the stadium \nBeckham joined Paris St-Germain in January 2013 and it was there he played the final match of his career four months later.

        "article_text": "Leeds won 29 Championship games this season - more than any other side\nAn incredible Championship title race came to a fitting end on Saturday, running all the way into stoppage time before Leeds United finally pipped Burnley to the post.\nManor Solomon's last-gasp winner at relegated Plymouth Argyle meant Leeds matched the Clarets' win over play-off chasing Millwall, just as the home fans at Turf Moor were gearing up for an almighty party.\nBefore kick-off, Leeds knew it was in their hands, but in typical style, twists and turns followed.\nIt was an epic ending to what has statistically been the most closely-fought hunt for the title. \nFor the first time ever, two teams reached 100 points in the same Championship campaign, with Leeds' superior goal difference proving decisive.\nWith Birmingham City also finishing with 111 points in League One, it is the first time in the Football League's 137-year history that three sides have earned a century of points in the same campaign.\nLeeds seal title with late winner as Argyle go down\nBurnley beat Millwall but miss out on title\nChampionship: Leeds clinch title; Luton down, Coventry and Bristol City into play-offs\nPop star Natasha Bedingfield sang on the pitch after Burnley secured promotion\nBurnley had seen records tumble, including a Championship-best 30 clean sheets - equalling Port Vale's Football League record set in 1953-54 - and have conceded just 16 goals.\nThey have not lost at home all season, have been beaten only twice in the league, and have been unbeaten in 33 Championship games since losing at Millwall in November.\nIt seemed unlikely they would not return to the Premier League as champions, as manager Scott Parker admitted.\n\"If you'd have said to me you'd reach 100 points, 33 games unbeaten, 16 goals conceded and you wouldn't win the league I'd have said 'no chance',\" Parker told BBC Radio Lancashire, after adding a third promotion to his name after success with Fulham in 2020 and Bournemouth in 2022. \n\"We've done remarkably this year. I'm so proud. We came into today hoping it would go our way, but wanting to win the game and get to 100 points, We did that.\"\nMeanwhile, where Burnley have thrived as a defensive unit, Leeds shone in attack. With 95 goals, they were by some distance the top scorers in the division. Joel Piroe (19), Dan James (12) and Solomon (10) have all reached double figures this season.\n\"I can't put into words what I'm feeling right now. It is a dream come true to score the winning goal and take this Championship,\" an emotional Solomon told BBC Radio Leeds at full-time. \n\"Throughout the season we've shown we deserve this trophy and to finish in the first spot. I'm so glad it happened.\n\"We all knew what was happening at Burnley and we knew we needed to score. It paid off and the ball went into the net. It will take me a few days to digest what happened today, right now I'm going to celebrate.\"\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke (right) has won promotion from the Championship for the third time\nLike Parker, Leeds boss Daniel Farke has vast experience of getting out of the Championship. \nHe did so as champions with Norwich City in 2019 and 2021 and has now led the West Yorkshire club back to the Premier League after bouncing back from play-off final heartache against Southampton a year ago.\nFarke told BBC Sport: \"Of course I'm happy that we won this game in the final stages and are officially allowed to label ourselves as champions and the best team this season.\n\"It's an emotionally moving day because we have invested so much and wanted to crown ourselves with some silverware.\n\"It feels pretty, pretty special in the dressing room and I'm very happy for my players and staff, it means so much for them, and also our supporters.\"\nNobody should forget Sheffield United, either. Although four defeats in five games in April, including a loss at Burnley which ultimately knocked them out of contention for automatic promotion, proved fatal, the Blades led for long periods and looked the most likely.\nChris Wilder's side will need to go again in the play-offs, starting against Bristol City in the semi-finals. They have shown their readiness for the Premier League this season, finishing on 90 points, a tally which would have been enough to go up automatically in three of the previous six seasons.\nWhile that points to a more competitive top of the Championship than ever, successive seasons with all three promoted clubs coming down, including Burnley and the Blades, offers a stark warning too.\nA strong defensive unit will be crucial to hopes of survival, and Clarets captain Josh Brownhill, who also scored 18 goals, believes his team have a strong chance of improvement this time around.\n\"This is a different team, we look in really good shape to go up for next season and hopefully stay up. It is going to be difficult but we've worked hard on everything; our defensive record speaks for itself,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Credit to the staff and the fans but mainly the gaffer. He has worked harder than anybody. 100 points, unbeaten at home, unbeaten in 33 games, our defensive record has been exceptional.\"\nNever before have two teams accrued so many points in the same season at the top of the second tier. \nTheir consistency and strength of character laid the groundwork. Leeds held their nerve in the end, and right at the end, but ultimately, both they and Burnley can revel in achievements fit for the history books.",

Zhao beats O'Sullivan with session to spare\nSeven-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan suffered a 17-7 loss to a dominant Zhao Xintong as his World Championship semi-final came to an end a session early.\nZhao, 28, becomes only the second player from Asia to reach a Crucible final, nine years after his Chinese compatriot Ding Junhui was runner-up to Mark Selby in 2016.\nLeading 12-4, Zhao compiled breaks of 62 and 128 to dash any hopes O'Sullivan had of building some momentum after taking the first two frames of Friday's evening session.\nWhile O'Sullivan, who is level on seven Crucible crowns in the modern era with Stephen Hendry, took the first frame after the mid-session interval, Zhao exhibited an incredible temperament to round off the match. \nIn front of a crowd overwhelmingly urging 49-year-old O'Sullivan to take the contest into Saturday, Zhao compiled breaks of 85, 63 and 88 to seal the most famous victory of his career.\n\"I can't believe that. I need to say thank you to Ronnie because he has helped me a lot before. He's my idol,\" Zhao told BBC Sport.\n\"It's my first time playing on the single table here, it's an amazing time for me and I just want to enjoy it because I don't know how many times I can try to enjoy it here.\n\"I've played here and sometimes the crowd is helpful for Ronnie and he deserves that, he is a legend here so I needed to control myself.\"\nZhao's scintillating showing on Friday morning laid the platform when he became only the fourth player to win a session 8-0 against O'Sullivan at the Crucible.\nIt was reminiscent of the form he displayed on his way to the UK title in 2021 and he was able to maintain that later in the day to become only the second player since John Parrott in 1994 to defeat O'Sullivan with a session to spare at snooker's most famous venue.\nO'Sullivan, who has won a record 41 ranking events, has made no secret about struggling with his cue since snapping his old one at the Championship League in January.\nHe turned up for his first-round match against Ali Carter with two cues from different manufacturers and has been constantly tinkering ever since.\nThat included two mid-match changes to his tip against Zhao and switching his ferrule from titanium to brass.\nHowever, it did not have the desired impact as he missed a series of regulation pots against an opponent who punished him in ruthless fashion.\n\"I just felt like I never gave him a game so that's a bit disappointing,\" said O'Sullivan.\n\"Zhao deserved his victory. I think he's done brilliantly all tournament and all credit to Zhao. He played better than me.\"\nRonnie O'Sullivan has only lost one other match at the Crucible before the scheduled final session\nIn the afternoon session in Sheffield, Judd Trump looked set to establish a big lead when he pulled 7-3 ahead of Mark Williams, but the veteran Welshman reined in the 2019 champion to leave the pair at 8-8 overnight.\nTrump, whose glory run six years ago gave him his only Crucible crown to date, extended his overnight lead from 5-3 by taking the opening two frames.\nBut Welshman Williams, 50, who is aiming to become the oldest ever Crucible finalist, rallied to take five of the next six frames on offer.\nJust as in their keenly-contested 2022 semi-final, which Trump edged 17-16, the tension was palpable.\nIt was underlined by Williams uncharacteristically hitting his own cue in frustration when he thought he had given up the opportunity to win the 15th frame, in which he eventually triumphed before rounding off the session with a composed 96.\n\"Absolute carnage. Amazing snooker,\" said six-time world champion Steve Davis on BBC Two.\n\"Mark Williams looked edgy early on, but as the session panned out he got calmer and calmer. Judd Trump must be wondering what is going on - it's not his fault, but Mark Williams is playing the best snooker he has all week.\"  \nTheir semi-final will get back under way at 10:00 BST on Saturday and finish in the evening session.\nRecap: How Zhao beat O'Sullivan to reach World Championship final\n'Looking for the holy grail' \u2013 O'Sullivan's master cue craftsman\n'National hero' - China's pursuit of an elusive world title\nZhao Xintong will return to the professional tour next season\nJohn Higgins and Graeme Dott both whitewashed O'Sullivan in sessions on their way to Crucible titles in 1998 and 2006, while Parrott did the same back in 1994 on only O'Sullivan's second appearance in snooker's blue-riband event.\nHowever, to see it happen on O'Sullivan's 33rd appearance at the event only served to underline his comments - dismissed in some quarters - that he had only reached this last-four stage because of shortcomings of his previous opponents.\nHis problems from long range were particularly evident against Carter, Pang Junxu and Si Jiahui, but he also toiled when presented with good opportunities to make sizeable contributions of his own.\nThe decision to change the ferrule on his cue - the metal part of the cue near the top which affects the amount of side and swerve you can apply to the white - from titanium to the more traditional brass did not reap any rewards.\nInstead, Zhao, who O'Sullivan has mentored at times, showcased his full repertoire of shots and by the end of Friday had remarkably achieved his 46th victory from 48 matches since returning from a 20-month ban.\nHe was one 10 players from China sanctioned in a match-fixing scandal. While Zhao did not directly throw a match, he accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself.\nAs a result of that suspension he lost his place on the World Snooker Tour, and he had to win four qualifying matches to earn a Crucible spot. \nOn this evidence he could return to the professional tour as world champion next term.\nO'Sullivan called his decision to compete in Sheffield the \"bravest\" of his career after suffering \"stage fright\" and not playing competitively since snapping his cue at the Championship League in January.\nHe pulled out of the Masters at Alexandra Palace on medical grounds, missed the German Masters in Berlin and apologised to fans after electing not to play at the Welsh Open.\nHe also withdrew from the World Grand Prix in Hong Kong in March and previously said he has had to take medication to deal with anxiety.\nHis candid studio discussion with Mark Selby on TNT Sports, external earlier this season also shone a light on the mental health pressures faced by snooker players.\nYet despite preparation that was far from ideal and his own protestations over his form, O'Sullivan deserves huge credit for finding his way through into a record-extending 14th appearance in the last four.\nO'Sullivan memorably defended his world crown in 2013, despite playing one competitive match prior to the showpiece event after taking an extended break from snooker that season.\nHowever, aside from having to try to play himself into form at an event that is regarded the sport's acid test, one of his major obstacles this time has been his dissatisfaction with his cue.\nKen Doherty, 1997 world champion: \"They [Trump and Williams] will look on the other side of the draw and think that the greatest player to ever play the game is out - and well beaten. \n\"They will have watched how well Zhao played and they'll know whoever gets through will be up against a tough opponent, one who's playing so carefree, very relaxed and probably doesn't realise the situation he's in - because he's just absolutely loving it.\"\nHearn 'a little more hopeful' over Crucible future\nWorld Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage",

        "article_text": "With days left to the election, Australian opposition candidates have been wooing a crucial group that turned its back on the conservative Liberal-National coalition in the last election: Chinese Australian voters.\nAnd they are trying to reach them on platforms that their party once talked of banning over national security concerns: Chinese social media apps like WeChat and RedNote.\nNearly six in 10 Chinese Australians use WeChat at least once a day, according to a poll by Lowy Institute in 2022.\nGrange Chung, who is contesting the New South Wales' seat of Reid, held by the left-leaning Labor party with a 3.2% margin, said in a video on WeChat that he chose to start his career in the navy \"to give back to the country that embraced my family when we arrived with very little\".\n\"Australia gave us a home... Let me finish what I started,\" he said in a video montage that included scenes of him putting up campaign posters and interacting with the electorate.\nDespite making up just 5.5% of Australia's population, Chinese Australians were said to be a crucial to the Labor party's win in 2022, which broke nearly a decade of rule by the Liberal-National coalition. \nChinese Australians have traditionally leaned conservative, but in several seats with  large Chinese Australian populations, the Liberals saw swings away three times larger than in other seats.\nSome analysts say the community turned its back on the Coalition because they felt its government did not handle racist attacks well during the pandemic, while others point to the then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison's anti-China rhetoric.\nAnd now, with their chances of winning narrowing, according to polls, Liberal candidates have been stepping up their battle for votes in marginal seats, many of which have large populations of Chinese Australians. \nIn order to be in with a chance of winning Reid, Grange Chung knows he needs to win over the suburb of Burwood, an area often billed as Sydney's second Chinatown, with Mandarin and Cantonese dominating conversations and the signboards for shops and restaurants.\nA former commercial pilot, Chung started posting on WeChat in February and has in recent months shared his interviews with Asian business owners, Lunar New Year greetings, and his promises to the community, where about one in five voters are ethnically Chinese. One post saw him quoting Sun Tzu's philosophy.\nHe is far from the only Liberal candidate to target the platform, with University of Melbourne researcher Fan Yang finding more than 220 authorised Liberal ads had been placed on WeChat since January, compared to about 35 for Labor.\nHenry Luo, secretary of the Reid Business Community, says he has observed more \"extensive targeting\" of Chinese Australian voters in this campaign, including candidates displaying ad banners on popular WeChat accounts and collaborating with well-known Chinese celebrities or influencers.\n\"I think it is an effective platform to reach the Chinese-speaking community. We discuss and debate plenty of political issues on WeChat,\" says Mr Luo, who moved to Australia for work in 2008.\nEven non-ethnic Chinese politicians have established a presence on the platforms, sharing videos of themselves enjoying Chinese cuisine and festivals.\nLiberal MP Keith Wolohan's channel has clips of him celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with his kids and enjoying spicy Hunan food with his father. Wolohan is defending his marginal seat in Menzies, Victoria.\nBut visibility on Chinese apps is not guaranteed to translate to votes, says Qiuping Pan, a lecturer in Chinese Studies at the University of Melbourne.\nThe Chinese Australian electorate have become more \"politically mature\", she says, adding that many may instead consider voting for independent candidates, whom some believe can better advocate for local communities because they do not tow party lines.\n\"Based on the last election, they know that their votes are important and have an impact. When they are portrayed negatively, they know they can fight back,\" she says.\nSome are frustrated that the community is being \"seen merely for votes\".\n\"When Chinese Australians want to be politically involved at a deeper level, we are sometimes cast as suspicious characters,\" says Sydney resident Erin Chew.\nShe points to how Liberal senator Jane Hume recently accused Asian volunteers for independent MP Monique Ryan of being \"Chinese spies\".\n\"This sort of narrative has been normalised by politicians and the media, which is why Australia's political environment is so problematic,\" she says.\nThese are precisely the concerns that candidates want to address on their social media channels.\nIn the New South Wales' seat of Bennelong, where nearly one in three people have Chinese ancestry, Liberal contender Scott Yung has his WeChat posts overlayed with Mandarin subtitles and audio translation. \nIt is likely to help him reach more voters: English proficiency is low - at about 25% to 26% - among Australians who primarily speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home, according to government data.\nIn 2022, Labor snatched the Liberal stronghold seat for only the second time in more than 70 years. It now holds Bennelong by a razor-thin margin.\nA recent clip shows Yung, who runs an education business, stressing what he calls the \"so, so important\" relationship between China and Australia: \"It's important for Australia, it's important for Australian businesses.\"\nHow the country manages its ties with China has an everyday impact on the lives of Chinese Australians, says Osmond Chiu, a research fellow at the Victoria-based Per Capita think tank.\n\"[The community's] concerns will include increased racism, the effect on those who do business with China and what it means for people with family in China,\" he says.\nFor some voters, the Liberals' campaign blitz on social media does not sync with its anti-migrant rhetoric. \"[Coalition leader] Peter Dutton has talked about slashing migration and international student numbers. We're feeling quite anxious about it,\" says Alex Wang, who works at a restaurant in Reid.",

He is likely to be joined in the squad by Matthew Potts (10 caps), Josh Tongue (two) and uncapped Essex man Sam Cook.\nA combination in the XI of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook would have 13 caps between them. Not since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago has England's pace attack looked so callow at home, when Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Richard Johnson had a combined seven caps.\nIndeed, England have played only one home Test without any of Woakes, Anderson or Stuart Broad in the past 18 years.\nAlthough Zimbabwe are improving \u2013 they have just earned a creditable 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh \u2013 England will be overwhelming favourites to win the four-day Test when it begins on 22 May.\nFollowing that, the five-match series at home to India and the Ashes away in Australia this winter will shape the leadership legacies of Stokes, coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.\n'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nWe've said naive things, but we do care - Wood\nWoakes has not played yet this season because of an ankle problem, while Wood is out until July following knee surgery.\nBrydon Carse remains sidelined with a foot problem and Olly Stone will not play before the back end of the summer after his own knee operation. Ollie Robinson, who has won 20 Test caps, has not played for England in more than a year and lost his central contract in October.\nAll-rounder Stokes, with 210 Test wickets, has more scalps than any other active England bowler, though his bowling is likely to be restricted. An injury sustained in the third Test against New Zealand in December was the second time in five months the talismanic captain had hurt his left hamstring.\nStokes will look to build his bowling in the run-up to the India series, when England will hope to have Woakes and Carse available. Jofra Archer could play his first red-ball game in four years for England Lions against India A in June. Speaking on Wednesday, Wood did not rule out a return for the conclusion of the India series.\nFor now, Atkinson will lead the attack following his stunning debut year in Test cricket while Potts played in England's last Test in New Zealand.\nTongue has not played for England for two years because of injuries but has enjoyed a superb start to the season with Nottinghamshire.\nCook, 27, has been the outstanding bowler in domestic cricket for some time, grabbing 318 first-class wickets at an average under 20.\nHe is not blessed with high pace and has had to wait for his chance, yet an indication an England call-up was on the horizon came when it was requested he be rested from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire last month.\nIf England feel they want further pace cover in the squad, it could come from 20-year-old left-armer Josh Hull, who made his Test debut last summer, or Hampshire's exciting prospect Sonny Baker. Baker has played only three first-class matches but was given an England development contract in February.\nOther areas of selection look more straightforward. Jamie Smith will return behind the stumps after missing the tour of New Zealand on paternity leave, while there is no suggestion Shoaib Bashir's place as the number one spinner is under threat.\nAny decisions over the top five will be delayed by Jacob Bethell's stint at the Indian Premier League. If batting cover is required, Jordan Cox has recovered from the broken thumb that prevented his debut in New Zealand and Durham opener Ben McKinney is highly rated.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of the most successful rappers and music moguls in the US, starts in New York on 5 May with jury selection. \nThe charges against him include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\nThe rapper also faces dozens of lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.\nMr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".\nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.\nHis early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G.\nHis music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\nMr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand, C\u00eeroc.\nIn 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.\nIn a federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nMany of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.\nIt includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, dozens of people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nIn a hearing in New York a week before the trial, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal. \nThey said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers. \nAt the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal. \nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on 5 May.\nThe first days of the trial will be for jury selection, with the trial starting in earnest after the panel is selected. \nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public.\nAll of his court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but have not been livestreamed.\nMost federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom.\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.\nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.\nTransportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",

It was to talk about safety and the racing.

We want to be able to work closely with the FIA. We all want to work together and make the sport better.\n\"We have faced a bit of an uphill challenge in that communication over time.\n\"We don't hold a power seat at the table and that needs to change, in my opinion.

The Saints again held firm against the maul but after illegal defence, Leinster were able to score through Caelan Doris off a tap penalty. \nThe Leinster and Ireland skipper followed his try with a 50:22 of his own soon after but again his side could not execute the line-out maul. \nSmith's second penalty pushed his side out to an eight-point lead but, with 20 minutes remaining, replacement Ryan Baird won the penalty and line-out that preceded Van der Flier's second score. \nAgain, though, the Saints produced a stout response. Only two minutes later, full-back James Ramm picked a brilliant line and was over in the corner.\nThe Saints' efforts to see out the victory were hampered when blind-side flanker Josh Kemeny was sent to the sin-bin for a high tackle on Rabah Slimani. \nWith 10 minutes to go, James Lowe halved the deficit as Leinster scored their second of the day from a well-worked tap penalty and Prendergast added the extras to bring his side within three. \nThe Saints again relied upon their stout maul defence but, as the clock showed 79 minutes, Leinster were awarded a penalty with Alex Coles sent to the sin-bin just as time expired on Kemeny's yellow.\nLeinster again went for the tap but the 14 men of Northampton turned them over on the line to complete a famous win. \nLeinster: Keenan; O'Brien, Ringrose, Henshaw, Lowe; Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Healy, Sheehan, Furlong, Snyman, McCarthy, Deegan, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\nReplacements: Kelleher, Porter, Slimani, Baird, Conan, McGrath, R Byrne, Barrett.\nNorthampton Saints: Ramm; Freeman, Dingwall (capt), Hutchinson, Litchfield; Smith, Mitchell; Iyogun, Langdon, Davison, Mayanavanua, Coles, Kemeny, Pollock, Augustus.\nReplacements: Walker, West, Millar Mills, Lockett, Munga, Scott-Young, James, Seabrook.\nYellow cards: Langdon, Kemeny, Coles\nReferee: Pierre Brousset (France)",

Even down to breaking a doorway... we drilled that day in, day out.

        "article_text": "While most 13-year-olds were spending their Monday evening stressing over homework, awkward school crushes and what to post on TikTok, Blue Ivy Carter was performing in front of a crowd of 70,000 people alongside her mother Beyonc\u00e9 on the opening night of her Cowboy Carter tour.\nHer numerous cameos throughout the show \u2013 particularly her solo dance during D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \u2013 were highly praised.\n\"She must be one of the most self-disciplined 13-year-olds in America,\" Variety's Chris Willman wrote. On social media, fans said the child prodigy was the \"greatest nepo baby of all time\" as they marvelled at her flawless dance routines.\nBeing a nepo baby - shorthand for the children of celebrities who often find themselves fast-tracked into industries such as film, fashion, and music - may have been scorned at in the past, but Blue Ivy's performance may have complicated the narrative.\nThe teen had access to a stage that most could only dream of, but she also delivered a performance that fans and critics agreed was very impressive, which raises the question: Is this just another example of a celebrity child given an unearned spotlight, or could Blue Ivy be a genuine star in her own right?\nThis is also not the first time Blue Ivy has performed in public \u2013 she joined her mother on stage two years ago on the Renaissance tour and last year voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King.\nBut music journalist Caroline Sullivan says Blue Ivy's trajectory to stardom \"has very little to do with her and everything to do with the parent\".\n\"It's about how much we like or dislike the parent \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9 is well liked so fans will praise Blue Ivy,\" she explains. \"Of course, it helps that she's good at what she does but even if she wasn't, she'd be given an easier ride.\"\nSullivan also says that the authenticity of Blue Ivy wanting to perform instead of being forced to do it by her mother adds to how we perceive her.\nSpeaking to the BBC last month, Beyonc\u00e9's mother, Tina Knowles, said Blue Ivy and her siblings were being nurtured to do \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed into show business\".\nShe added that her granddaughter had had to \"work for\" her role in The Lion King prequel and she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.\nBlue Ivy is hardly the first child to have performed on stage with a famous parent. Madonna's 17-year-old daughter played the piano on her mother's Celebration tour in 2023, Dave Grohl's 19-year-old daughter has often sung with him on stage and Phil Collins' son was the drummer on his 2019 tour.\n\"It's not because he's the boss's son that he's playing the drums, it's because he's good enough,\" the former Genesis drummer said in 2019 as he defended his decision to take his 17-year-old son on his world tour.\nSullivan says it can often be \"naff and cringy\" if a musician brings their child on stage \"just for the sake of it\", but if done right, it can be \"incredibly sweet and show a lot of love\".\nMany critics, including Tomas Mier from Rolling Stone, said Beyonc\u00e9's youngest daughter Rumi joining her on stage for Protector was \"one of the most heartwarming moments of the evening\".\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West's 11-year-old daughter, North West, has also forged the beginnings of a music career, recently delivering a rap verse in Japanese on FKA Twigs' single Childlike Things.\nTwigs said she chose to collaborate with North West because her \"energy is so inspiring\" and she was \"so confident\".\n\"I wasn't that confident when I was a kid. I was so shy, I was scared of the dark, I was very different to the other kids at my school. It suddenly occurred to me that I would have loved to have a friend like North, who could speak up for themselves.\"\nNorth West also appeared as Young Simba in the Hollywood Bowl's The Lion King 30th anniversary concert last year but her singing was criticised on social media.\n\"Given how controversial her parents are, I think North West will struggle to break away from the nepo baby claims because unless she is unbelievably talented, she will be slated,\" Sullivan says.\nIn December 2022, New York magazine's cover story on nepo babies caused a stir in the showbusiness industry.\nThe cover featured the faces of famous actors including Dakota Johnson, Jack Quaid, Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Lily Rose-Depp edited onto the bodies of babies, with the headline: \"She has her mother's eyes. And agent.\"\nThe story claimed that \"a nepo baby is physical proof that meritocracy is a lie\" and that \"today, they're not only abundant - they're thriving\".\nIt was met with backlash by many stars who claimed the label was unfair and diminished their hard work.\nGwyneth Paltrow, a nepo baby herself as the daughter of actress Blythe Danner and film director Bruce Paltrow, said the term was an \"ugly moniker\" and that children of famous people should not be judged negatively because \"there's nothing wrong with doing or wanting to do what your parents do\".\nSimilarly, Zoe Kravitz told GQ that it was \"completely normal for people to be in the family business\", while Stranger Things actress Maya Hawke said a famous family name \"definitely gives you massive advantages in this life but the chances will not be infinite; so you have to keep working and do a good job. If you do a bad job, the chances will stop\".\nAlmost Famous star Kate Hudson, daughter of actors Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, said in a 2022 interview with the Independent that \"people call it whatever they want\", but the idea that children will follow in the footsteps of their parents is \"not going to change\".\nHudson was right that, in the three years since New York magazine's cover story caused so much controversy, nepo babies haven't slunk off into the background. In fact, they continue to thrive, particularly those with real talent.\nPam Lyddon, a PR executive in the entertainment industry says that there's \"no denying that being well-connected can absolutely help you succeed in the industry\" but \"while connections might get you noticed, you do still need genuine talent, hard work, and resilience to stay in the game - results speak for themselves and reputations are everything.\"\nShe explains that for the new wave of nepo babies, talent is even more important as the \"scrutiny is more intense and people are more media savvy\" so you can't get away with mediocrity.\nAs fans and critics continue to praise Blue Ivy, it seems that the credibility of nepo babies hasn't been damaged by the nepo baby backlash, and if you have the star factor, your parents being Beyonce and Jay-Z is only going to help you fly.",

Should never have been allowed in the first place. Now every sport must follow suit.\"\nCampaign group Women's Rights Network said: \"We are pleased that the FA has finally seen the light. But it shouldn't have been such a hard fight to get here.\"\nAsked what Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer thought of transgender women being banned from women's sport, his spokesman said the government had \"been clear that biology matters when it comes to women's sport and that everyone should be compliant with the law\".\nHe said the government would \"continue to work to make sure that women and girls across the country can enjoy sports and we will continue to support bodies to protect the  integrity, safety and fairness of the game\".\nHe said it was the responsibility of sporting bodies to set their own rules.\nNatalie Washington, campaign lead for Football vs Transphobia, said transgender women are now likely to give up football.\n\"The people I know that are talking about this are saying, 'Well, that's it for football for me',\" she said.\n\"Most people clearly don't feel that they can go and play in the men's game for reasons of safety, for reasons of comfort.\"\nPride Sports, which runs the Football vs Transphobia campaign, said there is no \"football-specific peer-reviewed research or evidence that shows the existing policies constitute a safety risk\".\nLord David Triesman, former chairman of the FA, said there should be \"consequences for the most senior FA officers\" who took the decision to previously allow transgender women in women's football.\n\"The FA has finally seen sense. It would have been the utmost foolishness to disregard the Supreme Court,\" he said.\nAnti-discrimination group Kick it Out said: \"Now is the time to show solidarity with the trans community and remind ourselves that football brings people together and is often a space for belonging, connection, and joy.\n\"The recent Supreme Court ruling and the FA's decision to change its policy will have far-reaching consequences, not only for the people we support but for our friends, families, team-mates and wider communities.\n\"Transphobic abuse - on the pitch, in the stands and online - is real and rising.\"\nThe FA is the first major governing sporting body to amend its transgender eligibility criteria following the Supreme Court ruling.\nThe Ultimate Pool Group (UPG) - the professional body for eight-ball pool - banned transgender women from its female category last month.\nOther governing bodies, including the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), are reassessing their transgender eligibility criteria.\nAthletics, cycling and aquatics have implemented outright bans on transgender women taking part in women's events.\nIn 2022 British Triathlon became the first British sporting body to establish an open category in which transgender athletes can compete.\nThis year the ECB banned transgender women from elite domestic cricket.\nThe ruling meant any player that had gone through male puberty would not be able to feature in the top two tiers of the women's game, but that transgender women were still eligible for the third tier and below.\nHowever, the ECB is expected to follow the FA ruling by banning transgender women from all levels of the women's game.\nEngland Netball's new guidelines, which will apply from 1 September, recognise three distinct gender participation categories: female, male and mixed.\nThe female category would be \"exclusively for players born female, irrespective of their gender identity\", while mixed netball will \"serve as the sport's inclusive category, allowing players to complete under the gender with which they identify\". \nBBC sports editor Dan Roan\nThe FA is now talking to the 28 transgender women who are registered in England which this change in policy will affect in a bid to look at ways in which they can stay involved in the sport.\nIn recent years, governing bodies of other sports, like rugby and hockey, had introduced tougher gender policies, adding to the pressure on football to follow suit.\nSenior officials insist they have not taken an ideological position on what they see as a complicated issue, and that their task has always been to provide as many opportunities to play to as many people as possible.\nBut the fact they have had to perform a U-turn on a transgender eligibility policy they updated only three weeks ago will come under scrutiny.\nThe FA rejects suggestions that it caved in to pressure, claiming it had no choice to amend its approach yet again because its lawyers concluded that the subsequent Supreme Court ruling last month left it vulnerable to potential legal claims from some biologically female players.\nBut the fact they have done so will be welcomed by those who felt their previous stance was an unsatisfactory attempt at compromise between competing rights and freedoms - one that the critics felt lacked a clear direction, creating unclear and impractical guidelines and potentially compromising female players' fairness and safety as a result.\nSupporters of the trans community will be dismayed by what they see as an unnecessary, exclusionary and discriminatory policy that risks further marginalising a small number of people from the sport they love.\nWhat does the 'definition of a woman' ruling mean for sport?\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "The return of Marvel, Final Destination and Mission: Impossible franchises are among this month's unmissable films to watch and stream.\nCobra Kai began life as a YouTube series which picked up from where the 40-year-old Karate Kid franchise left off. In short, it didn't sound like essential viewing. But the series went on to be an Emmy-nominated, critically acclaimed, six-season hit, and it put the star of the 1984 film, Ralph Macchio, back in the limelight. Now Macchio is starring in a Karate Kid sequel, Karate Kid Legends, featuring Ben Wang as the new Kid on the block, a Chinese teenager who learns to fight bullies in New York. Confusingly, Legends follows the continuity of the original Karate Kid films, as well as the Cobra Kai series, but it also brings in Jackie Chan's Mr Han, who was in the 2010 Karate Kid remake. Still, Macchio promises that all the elements in this shared universe will be in balance \u2013 and as Mr Miyagi once explained, \"Balance is key\". \"Once we were able to line that up, for the Cobra Kai story to lead into the new film \u2013 even though they're separate ecosystems \u2013 it all made sense for me,\" Macchio said in Variety. \"Then, working with Jackie was just super exciting. I started this on the big screen. How cool is it to get it back to the big screen?\"\nReleased on 28, 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally\nDanny and Michael Philippou are the Australian twins who made Talk to Me, a terrifically creepy indie horror film which was an international hit in 2023. It was such a success, in fact, that you might have expected the Philippous to move straight onto a sequel, or even to a Hollywood blockbuster. Instead, the brothers stayed in their hometown of Adelaide and made another low-budget horror film with an original story: Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a foster mother, Laura, who is trying to contact the dead. Thematically, this supernatural chiller is closely related to Talk to Me, although it's been given extra depth by a death in the Philippou family.\u00a0\"We were doing pre-production meetings, then we started shooting, and there was no time to properly sort through those emotions,\" Danny Philippou said in Den of Geek. \"They sort of poured themselves out in the script and in conversations with Sally, so that bled into the character of Laura and scenes that were meant to be scary suddenly turned sad. I think there's a rawness in it that wasn't in Talk to Me.\"\nReleased on 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally\nThe co-director of Deaf President Now!, Nyle DiMarco, says that his documentary tells \"the story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of\". Its setting is Gallaudet University in Washington DC, the world's first university for deaf and hard of hearing students. Gallaudet was established in 1864, but for more than a century, none of its presidents was deaf. In 1988, when the board of trustees appointed yet another hearing president over two deaf candidates, the students wouldn't stand for it. Eight days of protests followed \u2013 and four of the protesters are interviewed in the film. Co-directed by Davis Guggenheim, who made the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and Still: A Michael J Fox Movie, Deaf President Now! is \"a firebrand historical documentary that is as crowd-pleasing and informative as it is innovative and inclusive\", says Marya E Gates at RobertEbert.com.\nReleased on 16 May on Apple+ internationally\nThere were five Final Destination films from 2000 to 2011, all with the same structure. First, there would be a spectacular catastrophe; then this sequence would be revealed to be someone's premonition; then the person who had the premonition would save a handful of people from the catastrophe when it actually happened; but then those people would be claimed by Death, one by one, usually via complicated accidents. Now the gleefully grisly franchise is back from the dead, so prepare to squeal and squirm at yet more ingeniously nasty killings. But Final Destination: Bloodlines has moved on from the previous films in one respect. According to the trailer, it turns out that all of the victims in the previous five films were descended from people who were saved from one particular catastrophe, decades ago. That means that the film isn't just about a group of strangers, but a family that is trying to break an inherited curse. \"Suddenly, the five films are not just one fun, gory rollercoaster ride after another, but a series with a lot of interweaving emotional weight,\" says Shawn Van Horn in Collider. \"Those stronger relationships are going to make the characters more three-dimensional, and we'll likely be rooting for their survival rather than relishing in the bloodshed.\" Well\u2026 maybe.\nReleased on 14, 15 and 16 May in cinemas internationally\nIn 2018, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour finished with Blake Lively's glamorous killer being jailed for 20 years, and with Anna Kendrick's widowed mother finding fame as a crime-solving vlogger, so a sequel didn't seem likely. But the film prided itself on its outrageous plot twists, so maybe it's appropriate that, seven years on, Lively's character is not just free from prison, but is about to marry a wealthy Italian on the island of Capri \u2013 and she is determined that her old frenemy should be her maid of honour. A Simple Favour was a devilish comedy noir that treated viewers to deceit, betrayal, murder, and the sight of Lively sipping martinis while wearing absurdly stylish outfits. Another Simple Favour is even more lavish in its fashions, and even more head-spinning in its plotting. Kristy Puchko in Mashable calls it a \"shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humour, relish in mob drama [and] plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre\". Fans of the first film will \"cherish this divinely twisted thriller\".\u00a0\nReleased on 1 May on Prime Video internationally\nTim Robinson, a Saturday Night Live alumnus with his own sketch show, Netflix's I Think You Should Leave, has his first big-screen leading role in Friendship. And, true to form, it will make you cringe as much as laugh. Robinson plays Craig, a suburban office worker who is too awkward to have any real friends. Then he meets his neighbour, Brian (Paul Rudd), a weatherman who plays in a punk band in his spare time, which makes him fabulously cool by Craig's standards. Craig is thrilled to hang out with his Brian and his buddies, but after he ruins one social occasion too many, Brian \"breaks up\" with him, and he spirals out of control. Written and directed by Andrew DeYoung, this bromantic black comedy is \"feverishly and hilariously demented\", says Nick Schager in the Daily Beast. \"Partnered with the always ridiculous Rudd, Robinson reconfirms his standing as the reigning master of discomfort. Together, they make Friendship the funniest movie of the year.\"\nReleased on 9 May in the US\nAdmittedly, the last of Disney's live-action remakes, Snow White, was (a) dogged by controversy, and (b) not very good, but Lilo & Stitch looks a lot more promising. The film retells the story a genetically engineered, blue-furred alien called Experiment 626, or Stitch. He is so destructive that he is condemned to be exiled to an asteroid, but he escapes from the interstellar authorities and crash-lands on Earth, where he is befriended by a Hawaiian girl, Lilo. The original 2002 film, then, was one of the few Disney cartoons to have a modern-day US setting, and one of the few to mix contemporary human beings with fantastical creatures \u2013 so, for once, a remake that has both live-action and CGI characters makes total sense. Another good sign is that the film is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, who made the Oscar-nominated charmer Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. And a third key factor is that, in the trailers, Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, seems to have the most adorable chemistry with an alien since Drew Barrymore was in ET The Extra Terrestrial.\nReleased on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally\nNicolas Cage doesn't appear in many subtle dramas these days, so you may not be surprised to hear that The Surfer is \"a gloriously demented B-movie thriller\", as Xan Brooks puts it in The Observer, or that Cage cranks \"the acting dial from befuddled to vexed to outraged to volcanic\". He plays an unnamed businessman who has returned to Australia after years in California, and who wants to buy the beachfront house where he grew up. But when he tries to surf in a nearby bay, he is harassed by a gang of locals led by a shamanic thug (Julian McMahon). Cage's character won't be put off, though, and camps out in the car park above the beach, sacrificing his possessions and his sanity in the process. \"Crisply scripted by Thomas Martin and directed by Lorcan Finnegan with a pleasing, no-frills intensity,\" says Brooks, \"The Surfer [is] a low-budget, hard-hitting comic bruiser of a picture: a midlife-crisis movie dressed up as a 1970s exploitation flick [with a] wild, roiling, hallucinogenic vibe.\"\nReleased on 2 May in the US and Canada, 9 May in the UK and Ireland, and 15 May in Australia\nJane Austen may be turning 250 in December, but film and TV directors are as smitten by her novels as ever. Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden are starring in a new Netflix adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and before that there is a French romantic comedy drama, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, written and directed by Laura Piani. Camille Rutherford stars as Agathe, who works in a bookshop in Paris, but dreams of becoming an author. With the encouragement of her friend Felix (Pablo Pauly), she accepts the offer of a writing residency in England set up by the Austen estate. Will she finish her novel at last? Will she come to see Felix as more than a friend? Or will she fall for one of the residency's organisers (Charlie Anson), a handsome toff who happens to be the great-great-great-great-nephew of Austen\u00a0herself? \"The film is a delightful ode to Jane Austen's novels, serving up a unique blend of humour and introspection that reflects both European sensibilities and the particular quirks of Austen's world,\" says Louisa Moore in Screen Zealots.\nReleased on 16 May in Spain, 23 May in the US, and 30 May in the UK\nThe original Mission: Impossible TV series ran for just seven years, but the film series has been running for 29 \u2013 and its star, Tom Cruise, does plenty of running himself. Could the franchise be coming to a conclusion at last? The subtitle of the eighth instalment, Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning, suggests that Ethan Hunt won't be choosing to accept any more missions after this one, so this could be the last time we'll see Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell crashing cars and jumping off buildings. On the other hand, Cruise is refusing to confirm whether or not Hunt will live to fight another day. \"You gotta see the movie,\" he told Empire magazine. \"It's a hard thing for me to discuss at the moment, because it really is something that you have to experience.\" The film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, is also being cagey, but he does acknowledge that the word \"Final\" is in there for a reason. \"It is, I hope, the satisfying conclusion to a 30-year story arc,\" he says. \"I'm pretty confident that people are going to feel that the title was appropriate.\"\nReleased on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally\nIt seems as if writers and directors can't stop celebrating/ satirising the luxurious lifestyles \u2013 and enviable kitchens \u2013 of the super-rich, whether in such television series as The White Lotus, The Perfect Couple and Your Friends and Neighbors, or in such films as Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness and Blink Twice. The sharpest of all of these depictions is Succession, Jesse Armstrong's multiple Emmy-winning series about a Murdoch-alike media dynasty. And now, two years after Succession concluded its run, Armstrong returns to the territory he has made his own. Mountainhead is a comedy drama shot in Park City, Utah, starring Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith and Ramy Youssef as billionaire tech bros on holiday in a ski resort during a global crisis. The film wasn't even shot until March this year, so Armstrong and his team must be editing it at lightning speed. Could that mean that Mountainhead will be the most topical fictional commentary on the 1% so far?\nReleased on 31 May on HBO and Max, and 1 June on Sky and NOW\n\"After years of misfires, disappointments, and a growing sense of superhero fatigue, the MCU looks poised for a comeback with the highly anticipated arrival of Thunderbolts,\" says Linda Marric in HeyUGuys, \"a gritty but mostly fun new adventure that just might put Marvel back on top.\" The idea behind this rough-edged spy caper is that Marvel's least powerful, least glamorous, and least fulfilled superheroes have been carrying out covert missions for a shady businesswoman (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When she decides that they're expendable, these grumpy loners are forced to form a ragtag team consisting of Florence Pugh's Yelena, David Harbour's Red Guardian, Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, Wyatt Russell's US Agent, and Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost. \"It is a film that makes us truly care about its characters and their well-being,\" says Marric. \"It's gritty, chaotic and sometimes uneven, but also thrilling and unexpectedly heartfelt. Best of all, it proves Marvel can still surprise us when it stops trying to please everyone and leans into the weirdness.\"\u00a0\nOut now in cinemas internationally\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

Kill your local MP.\"\nOn Thursday, the Metropolitan Police said they will investigate online videos showing Kneecap calling for the death of British MPs and shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\".\nKneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual.\nBoth Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\nThe husband of murdered MP Jo Cox later called on Kneecap to give a \"real apology\".\nKatie Amess, whose father Sir David Amess was an MP when he was murdered in 2021, said she was \"gobsmacked at the stupidity of somebody or a group of people being in the public eye and saying such dangerous, violent rhetoric\".\nKneecap say the videos have been taken out of context.\nA number of politicians have called for the Irish rap band to be uninvited from UK gigs.\nSome of the band's performances have been cancelled but a number of artists have signed a joint statement in support of Kneecap and freedom of expression through the band's label Heavenly Recordings.\nBut what do young people on the Falls Road in west Belfast think? \nPE and Primary Education student Naoise McCrory, 19, has been a fan of Kneecap for a few years and said her opinion on the group hasn't changed. \n\"Although there's a lot of controversy right now I'm still a fan of Kneecap and I think what they're doing is they're just spreading awareness on major issues that are going on right now in other parts of the world,\" she said.\n\"I can understand completely why some people have been offended but at the same time I just think personally what they're doing is that they're just trying to spread awareness and some things have been taken too literally and people can be offended on both sides.\"\nNaoise has tickets to go and see Kneecap in their Belfast concert at Boucher Playing Fields and says she will \"100% still go to their gig\". \nCinematography and photography student Cian Davison, 24, said he doesn't agree with what Kneecap have been saying recently but he enjoys their music. \n\"I think they're putting Irish language back on the map,\" he said.\n\"They're very talented individuals, not afraid to wear their identity on their chest and I really enjoy their music. I think they're a great artform and platform for young people to listen to and to relate to.\n\"Obviously to threaten anybody, to make a violent threat is disappointing, like it's not on and shouldn't happen anywhere no matter who you are or where you're from.\"\nCian added: \"Depending on what they say in the future, obviously they should be allowed to have freedom of speech within their artcraft.\n\"They have a lot of susceptible, young fans that would do anything that they say so I think it's important that they watch what they say.\" \nEnglish literature student Chloe Bell, 20, is planning to watch Kneecap live when they support Fontaines DC at Belfast Vital in August. \nShe says she still supports Kneecap.\n\"I still listen to their music and I know people are just trying to badmouth them but sure nowadays people are always trying to badmouth people on the internet so everyone always has a problem with something,\" she said.\nChloe said she expects the concert this summer with Fontaines DC will go ahead.\nAidan Toner, 21, is from west Belfast.\nHe said has seen some videos but they haven't changed his opinion on the trio at all. \n\"They're standing up for their country, as every person should... they can do what they want,\" he said.\n\"I like their music - I don't think the gigs should be cancelled.\"\nMusic and Primary Education student Eoin Ferry, 19, said his opinion on Kneecap hasn't changed. \n\"I actually do love Kneecap,\" he said.\n\"I've followed them for years and I do love their music and I enjoy listening to them.\n\"I think that since I have been a fan for such a long time, it's not really changing my opinion on them. I still stand with them.\"\nHe added: \"Personally as a musician myself, it's up to yourself if you want to [state political opinions]. \n\"You shouldn't be made to do anything you don't want to do but if you want to I think that should be fine.\n\"Everyone's always going to have different opinions so I think Kneecap should just keep doing what they're doing and it's up to everyone else what they think of it.\"\nKneecap are an Irish-speaking rap trio who have courted controversy with their provocative lyrics and merchandise.\nThe group was formed in 2017 by three friends who go by the stage names of Mo Chara, M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap and DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed.\nTheir rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalised film starring Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender.\nThe film won a British Academy of Film Award (Bafta) in February 2025.",

        "article_text": "Leeds won 29 Championship games this season - more than any other side\nAn incredible Championship title race came to a fitting end on Saturday, running all the way into stoppage time before Leeds United finally pipped Burnley to the post.\nManor Solomon's last-gasp winner at relegated Plymouth Argyle meant Leeds matched the Clarets' win over play-off chasing Millwall, just as the home fans at Turf Moor were gearing up for an almighty party.\nBefore kick-off, Leeds knew it was in their hands, but in typical style, twists and turns followed.\nIt was an epic ending to what has statistically been the most closely-fought hunt for the title. \nFor the first time ever, two teams reached 100 points in the same Championship campaign, with Leeds' superior goal difference proving decisive.\nWith Birmingham City also finishing with 111 points in League One, it is the first time in the Football League's 137-year history that three sides have earned a century of points in the same campaign.\nLeeds seal title with late winner as Argyle go down\nBurnley beat Millwall but miss out on title\nChampionship: Leeds clinch title; Luton down, Coventry and Bristol City into play-offs\nPop star Natasha Bedingfield sang on the pitch after Burnley secured promotion\nBurnley had seen records tumble, including a Championship-best 30 clean sheets - equalling Port Vale's Football League record set in 1953-54 - and have conceded just 16 goals.\nThey have not lost at home all season, have been beaten only twice in the league, and have been unbeaten in 33 Championship games since losing at Millwall in November.\nIt seemed unlikely they would not return to the Premier League as champions, as manager Scott Parker admitted.\n\"If you'd have said to me you'd reach 100 points, 33 games unbeaten, 16 goals conceded and you wouldn't win the league I'd have said 'no chance',\" Parker told BBC Radio Lancashire, after adding a third promotion to his name after success with Fulham in 2020 and Bournemouth in 2022. \n\"We've done remarkably this year. I'm so proud. We came into today hoping it would go our way, but wanting to win the game and get to 100 points, We did that.\"\nMeanwhile, where Burnley have thrived as a defensive unit, Leeds shone in attack. With 95 goals, they were by some distance the top scorers in the division. Joel Piroe (19), Dan James (12) and Solomon (10) have all reached double figures this season.\n\"I can't put into words what I'm feeling right now. It is a dream come true to score the winning goal and take this Championship,\" an emotional Solomon told BBC Radio Leeds at full-time. \n\"Throughout the season we've shown we deserve this trophy and to finish in the first spot. I'm so glad it happened.\n\"We all knew what was happening at Burnley and we knew we needed to score. It paid off and the ball went into the net. It will take me a few days to digest what happened today, right now I'm going to celebrate.\"\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke (right) has won promotion from the Championship for the third time\nLike Parker, Leeds boss Daniel Farke has vast experience of getting out of the Championship. \nHe did so as champions with Norwich City in 2019 and 2021 and has now led the West Yorkshire club back to the Premier League after bouncing back from play-off final heartache against Southampton a year ago.\nFarke told BBC Sport: \"Of course I'm happy that we won this game in the final stages and are officially allowed to label ourselves as champions and the best team this season.\n\"It's an emotionally moving day because we have invested so much and wanted to crown ourselves with some silverware.\n\"It feels pretty, pretty special in the dressing room and I'm very happy for my players and staff, it means so much for them, and also our supporters.\"\nNobody should forget Sheffield United, either. Although four defeats in five games in April, including a loss at Burnley which ultimately knocked them out of contention for automatic promotion, proved fatal, the Blades led for long periods and looked the most likely.\nChris Wilder's side will need to go again in the play-offs, starting against Bristol City in the semi-finals. They have shown their readiness for the Premier League this season, finishing on 90 points, a tally which would have been enough to go up automatically in three of the previous six seasons.\nWhile that points to a more competitive top of the Championship than ever, successive seasons with all three promoted clubs coming down, including Burnley and the Blades, offers a stark warning too.\nA strong defensive unit will be crucial to hopes of survival, and Clarets captain Josh Brownhill, who also scored 18 goals, believes his team have a strong chance of improvement this time around.\n\"This is a different team, we look in really good shape to go up for next season and hopefully stay up. It is going to be difficult but we've worked hard on everything; our defensive record speaks for itself,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Credit to the staff and the fans but mainly the gaffer. He has worked harder than anybody. 100 points, unbeaten at home, unbeaten in 33 games, our defensive record has been exceptional.\"\nNever before have two teams accrued so many points in the same season at the top of the second tier. \nTheir consistency and strength of character laid the groundwork. Leeds held their nerve in the end, and right at the end, but ultimately, both they and Burnley can revel in achievements fit for the history books.",

You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.\nThere's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.\nSo what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?\nTo count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.\nFor someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.\nShe says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.\nRestricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"\nBut what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?\nMs Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.\nThey found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"\nAnd it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".\nBut - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.\nMs Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?\nThe definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.\n\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"\nBut the definition was broadened, Professor Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.\nThe eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.\nAnother subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.\nToday, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.\nThe autism net has been cast wider.\nOne group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.\nStudies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.\nIt's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.\n\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"\nMs Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.\nShe says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".\nBecause autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nNow we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.\nShe says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.\nThe rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.\n\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"\nThere's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.\nFor Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.\nThe 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"\nShe says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"\nHer autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.\nBut others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.\nA focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".\nAs the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.\nThere's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.\nThe internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.\nDisproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.\nBut, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.\nIs there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?\nGinny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.\n\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"\nShe also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".\nBut Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.\n\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"\nYou can listen to The Autism Curve on BBC Sounds now",

It has already racked up more than 1.4m views on TikTok.\nDo you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\nKeable was co-signed by Beyonc\u00e9 earlier this year, who named her as an artist who inspired her. She has achieved 2m monthly streams on Spotify and is playing Glastonbury, SXSW, Colors NYC and Meltdown festivals this summer.\nSasha is a singer now but grew up in the centre of the football world - her stepdad, Nick Broad, was head of sports science at Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea, and was working with Carlo Ancelotti as performance manager at Paris St-Germain when he died in a car accident in 2013.\n\"I've seen all sides of football, not just as a fan,\" she told BBC Sport. \"When Carlo got fired by Chelsea, my stepdad was fired too. He didn't know what he was going to do, but then Carlo went to PSG and asked him to go with him.\n\"Sadly he passed away while he was in Paris but we are still close to the Ancelotti family. He and Carlo were such good friends.\n\"I look back now and my stepdad was a real pioneer in his work in sports science and nutrition. The things he introduced, like GPS tracking in training and collecting cardio data, were all new then but they are industry standard now.\n\"It's incredible to see his work live on in that way. Some of his old friends and colleagues reach out to me now when they see me doing my own thing on social media and talk about how his work was incredible. \n\"I always wonder how much further he could have pushed the use of science in football if he was still here, but I'm so pleased you can still see his legacy.\"\nNick Broad (right) celebrates with Carlo Ancelotti (centre) after Chelsea's FA Cup win in 2010, which completed a double of Premier League and FA Cup that season\nBefore becoming a singer, Sasha dreamed of being a footballer herself. Now she settles for collecting shirts instead, with a Tino Asprilla Colombia shirt from 1994 taking pride of place.\n\"I played all the time when I was a kid, from the age of about six,\" explained Sasha.\n\"It was a bit different for girls then because it was before the women's game really took off and you didn't really have a route to becoming a professional in this country. I wanted to go to the United States to play. \n\"I was quite a tomboy so I used to play with the boys all the time - I had to. We did not even have a girls team at my school until my friends and I asked to play with the boys and, after that, they formed a team for us.\n\"Fortunately it's all changed now and football is so much more accessible for girls. If you don't have the chance to try something, how do you know if you will love it?\"\nChris Sutton and Sasha Keable were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nEtihad Stadium, 20:00 BST\nThis should be a great game, because Wolves are so powerful and they will have no fear at all after winning six games in a row.\nBut Manchester City have looked much more solid in the past few weeks and they are on a bit of a roll themselves, with four successive wins in all competitions.\nPep Guardiola's side will look to control this game, the same way they did in the first half of their FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest, but I don't think they will find it easy to keep Wolves quiet.\nStill, I went against City in their last home game, against Aston Villa, and I was wrong. I am not going to make the same mistake again.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: This is a tough game for City but I still think they will win. 2-1\nVilla Park, 12:30 BST\nIt would be easy to say the wheels have come off at Aston Villa, wouldn't it? \nIn the past couple of weeks, they have gone out of the Champions League and FA Cup, and losing their last Premier League game has left them playing catch-up in the top-five race.\nI don't think Unai Emery's side will crumble from here, though, even if Marcus Rashford's season-ending injury is a big blow.\nVilla need to win this, and they also need a big performance from Ollie Watkins. If he starts banging the goals in again then that would be a huge boost for their run-in.\nFulham are a nightmare to predict, as I've mentioned in previous weeks, and they are certainly capable of getting something here.\nI don't think Villa can keep a clean sheet - which probably means they will stop Fulham scoring - but I have a feeling things will click for them in front of goal.\nAlso, they are at home too so, if they need them, their fans can help to get them over the line.\nSutton's prediction: 3-1\nSasha's prediction: I want to back Fulham here, for south-west London. 0-3\nGoodison Park, 15:00 BST\nI am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live and I am really looking forward to going to Goodison Park again.\nEverything points towards a home win, despite Everton losing their previous two games. \nIpswich are definitely down now and, while they won't throw in the towel, they might be a little less spirited now they know they are relegated.\nTheir confidence has been sapped over the course of the season and, after watching them recently, I can't back them to get anything here. \nThey were flimsy against Arsenal, then well beaten by Newcastle, and it would be a shock if they scored at all, let alone break my record for the fastest goal scored by an away player at Goodison.\nEverton have stuttered in the past couple of weeks but I don't think that is a bad thing for David Moyes. \nHe has over-achieved since taking charge in January, when the reality is that he has got the same group of players as his predecessor, Sean Dyche, and there needs to be a lot of work done on improving that squad in the summer.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I am not sure if Ipswich will put up as much of a fight now they are relegated. 1-0\nKing Power Stadium, 15:00 BST\nLeicester have been rotten but, somehow, Southampton have been even worse.\nIt's sad to see Jamie Vardy leaving the Foxes at the end of the season, but maybe this might be the send-off he deserves. I am going with him to score the winner.\nThese two teams actually served up a thriller at St Mary's Stadium back in October, when Vardy got one of Leicester's goals as they fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\nI am expecting the same outcome here, just with a lot less excitement. The readers will go for a draw, I am sure of it, but I am pretty confident about Leicester taking this one.\nSutton's prediction: 1-0\nSasha's prediction: It's mad how bad both these teams have been. I don't think either of them will get a goal, let alone the win. 0-0\nEmirates Stadium, 17:30 BST\nWe know how dangerous Bournemouth are, because they beat Arsenal in October, and if Mikel Arteta rests players then this game becomes even harder for the Gunners.\nIt's a tricky situation for Arteta, because he will want to head to Paris St-Germain for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final with a bit of momentum, but he has got to balance that with the risk of injury to his key players.\nBournemouth's form has improved of late, and the circumstances mean they definitely have a decent chance of doing the double over Arsenal this season.\nThis all boils down to what the Arsenal team is, so it is difficult to make a call without knowing that, but they are at home and even if they are not at full strength then I can still see them getting a draw.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's a strange situation for Arsenal but I am still backing us to win. 2-0\nGtech Community Stadium, 14:00 BST\nWe know Manchester United are going to make changes here, because seeing out the second leg of their Europa League semi-final with Athletic Bilbao is their priority.\nRuben Amorim's side nicked a point at the very end of their game at Bournemouth last weekend, which sparked mass celebrations, but I really don't see them doing the same against Brentford - they won't be getting the bunting out this time.\nThe Bees are such a dangerous team when they come forward and they will keep on attacking United. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa should get plenty of chances and I can see them getting a goal or two between them.\nSutton's prediction: 2-0\nSasha's prediction: I just have a feeling United will nick this. 0-1\nAmex Stadium, 14:00 BST\nBrighton got back to winning ways last weekend thanks to Carlos Baleba's brilliant late strike against West Ham.\nThe Seagulls beat Newcastle at St James' Park earlier in the season too, but that was before Eddie Howe's side hit their stride, and it is a big ask for Brighton to repeat that result.\nNewcastle were just relentless in their win over Ipswich and another three points here would be massive in their bid for a top-five finish - I don't think they will get them, but we will see a few goals.\nSutton's prediction: 2-2\nSasha's prediction: Newcastle will take this one. 0-2\nLondon Stadium, 14:00 BST\nThis is 17th versus 16th in the Premier League which tells you how bad both teams have been this season.\nEveryone knows Tottenham's focus will be on their Europa League semi-final second leg with Bodo/Glimt so I think West Ham boss Graham Potter needs a result here more than Ange Postecoglou.\nPotter's results have been poor since he took over from Julen Lopetegui in January and the Hammers fans have not had the upturn they wanted in the way their team play either.\nSpurs can still be dangerous even when they are out of form but Ange is not going to pick his strongest team. That gives West Ham a better chance of getting the win they badly need, but I don't see them doing it in style.\nSutton's prediction: 2-1\nSasha's prediction: I don't want to say Tottenham will win, but I think they will. 1-2\nStamford Bridge, 16:30 BST\nI would usually be asking which Chelsea side will turn up, but that applies to Liverpool too this week.\nArne Slot's side could have been out all week celebrating their title win and we don't know how that will affect them.\nYou often play at your best when you have been on the lash in a scenario like theirs. For example, some of my best games for Celtic came after nights out where we had won something and were allowed to have a couple of beers, but I don't know what to expect here.\nChelsea have nicked a couple of results recently, to stay in the race for the top five, but their performances have not been too convincing and their fans still don't seem to have taken to Enzo Maresca's playing style.\nThis is not the test for them that it would be if Liverpool were trying to close out the title but I don't think Slot is the type to let anyone take their foot off the gas. He will put out a strong team and even if they play with more freedom, I still think Liverpool will leave with the points.\nSutton's prediction: 1-2\nSasha's prediction: I still have a connection with Chelsea because of my stepdad and I have got to back them here. 3-0\nSelhurst Park, 20:00 BST\nCrystal Palace will be on a high after booking their place in the FA Cup final, so this is another very tricky game for Nottingham Forest, who slipped up at home against Brentford on Thursday.\nNuno Espirito Santo's side will have to be stubborn and resolute to get anything at Selhurst Park. They have shown that kind of character plenty of times already this season but they really need it now.\nLooking at the race for the top five you feel like every team involved needs to win every game, but of course that is not going to happen, and I can see my boyhood team Forest dropping more points here. I just hope it doesn't prove crucial for them.\nSutton's prediction: 1-1\nSasha's prediction: It's got to be Palace here. I am loyal to the London teams! 3-0\nChris got five correct results with one exact score from the nine Premier League games he predicted in week 34, giving him a total of 80 points.\nHe beat his guest, golf hero Lee Westwood, who got four correct results with no exact scores, leaving him on 40 points and tied with the BBC readers, who also got five correct results with one exact score.\nWestwood and the BBC readers were wrong about both FA Cup semi-finals, while Chris correctly picked City to beat Forest and wrongly thought Aston Villa would beat Crystal Palace. Those ties do not count towards the weekly totals.\nThe other game from week 34, Manchester City's 2-1 win over Aston Villa, took place on 22 April and does not count towards the weekly result either.\nSherelle, the guest in week 33, made the prediction instead of Westwood and picked up 40 points for the guests' overall total (but not her own individual tally) with an exact score. Chris and the BBC readers both went for a 2-1 Villa win.",

        "article_text": "Sam Cook was rested for Essex's County Championship match against Worcestershire last month at England's request\nEssex bowler Sam Cook is in line for an England debut after being named in the squad for the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge.\nThe 27-year-old, the outstanding seamer in domestic cricket in recent seasons, gets his chance in an inexperienced attack missing a number of players through injuries.\nChris Woakes, Mark Wood, Brydon Carse and Olly Stone are all absent, while Jofra Archer continues his long route back to red-ball cricket at the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nIt means England begin a defining year of Test cricket, including marquee series against India and Australia, with a fresh-looking pace attack.\nAlong with Cook, Nottinghamshire seamer Josh Tongue returns almost two years after winning the last of his two caps.\nGus Atkinson, who has 11 caps, and Matthew Potts (10) are the other specialist seamers in the 13-man party.\nA likely combination of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook in the XI on 22 May would have 13 caps between them, England's fewest in the pace attack at home since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago.\nEngland have played only one home Test without at least one of Woakes, James Anderson or Stuart Broad in their XI since 2007.\nEngland squad: Ben Stokes (Durham) - captain, Gus Atkinson (Surrey), Shoaib Bashir (Somerset), Harry Brook (Yorkshire),  Sam Cook (Essex), Jordan Cox (Essex), Zak Crawley (Kent), Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Matthew Potts (Durham), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Jamie Smith (Surrey), Josh Tongue (Nottinghamshire)\nBBC and ECB agree new four-year rights deal\nWoakes on way back for Warwickshire\nSteven Finn column: 'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nIn a squad containing no surprises, captain Ben Stokes is fit to lead after undergoing hamstring surgery at Christmas.\nThe match at Trent Bridge will be the all-rounder's first action since suffering the injury to his left leg in the final Test against New Zealand in December. There are likely to be limitations on how much the 33-year-old will bowl.\nUncapped Essex batter Jordan Cox, who missed out on a Test debut in New Zealand because of a broken thumb, also returns to the squad as cover for the top order.\nBatter Jacob Bethell impressed in his first series in New Zealand but is at the IPL, so opener Zak Crawley and number-three Ollie Pope get the chance to cement their places. Shoaib Bashir is retained as the sole spinner.\nEngland have made no secret of their desire for bowlers of high pace so Cook, an 'English style' seamer whose strengths lie in accuracy and movement, has had to wait for his chance.\nThe former Loughborough University student has taken 318 first-class wickets at an average below 20 and has played three times for England Lions, including on the tour of Australia earlier this year.\nRealistically, Cook is competing for one spot in the first-choice XI with Woakes. The Warwickshire man is yet to play this season because of an ankle injury.\nAnother option would have been Dan Worrall, who played three one-day internationals and has now qualified to play for England, but the Surrey man has been overlooked.\nZimbabwe's last Test in the UK was in 2003, a series famous for the Test debut of Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker.\nEngland will be overwhelming favourites to win at Trent Bridge, though the Zimbabweans have just claimed a creditable 1-1 draw in Bangladesh.

        "summary": "Cook in line for England debut after squad call-upImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sam Cook was rested for Essex's County Championship match against Worcestershire last month at England's requestStephan ShemiltChief Cricket ReporterPublished2 May 2025, 12:00 BST298 CommentsEssex bowler Sam Cook is in line for an England debut after being named in the squad for the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge.The 27-year-old, the outstanding seamer in domestic cricket in recent seasons, gets his chance in an inexperienced attack missing a number of players through injuries.Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Brydon Carse and Olly Stone are all absent, while Jofra Archer continues his long route back to red-ball cricket at the Indian Premier League (IPL).It means England begin a defining year of Test cricket, including marquee series against India and Australia, with a fresh-looking pace attack.Along with Cook, Nottinghamshire seamer Josh Tongue returns almost two years after winning the last of his two caps.Gus Atkinson, who has 11 caps, and Matthew Potts (10) are the other specialist seamers in the 13-man party.A likely combination of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook in the XI on 22 May would have 13 caps between them, England's fewest in the pace attack at home since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago.England have played only one home Test without at least one of Woakes, James Anderson or Stuart Broad in their XI since 2007.England squad: Ben Stokes (Durham) - captain, Gus Atkinson (Surrey), Shoaib Bashir (Somerset), Harry Brook (Yorkshire),  Sam Cook (Essex), Jordan Cox (Essex), Zak Crawley (Kent), Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Matthew Potts (Durham), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Jamie Smith (Surrey), Josh Tongue (Nottinghamshire)BBC and ECB agree new four-year rights dealPublished9 hours agoWoakes on way back for WarwickshirePublished1 day agoSteven Finn column: 'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'Published1 day agoIn a squad containing no surprises, captain Ben Stokes is fit to lead after undergoing hamstring surgery at Christmas.The match at Trent Bridge will be the all-rounder's first action since suffering the injury to his left leg in the final Test against New Zealand in December. There are likely to be limitations on how much the 33-year-old will bowl.Uncapped Essex batter Jordan Cox, who missed out on a Test debut in New Zealand because of a broken thumb, also returns to the squad as cover for the top order.Batter Jacob Bethell impressed in his first series in New Zealand but is at the IPL, so opener Zak Crawley and number-three Ollie Pope get the chance to cement their places. Shoaib Bashir is retained as the sole spinner.England have made no secret of their desire for bowlers of high pace so Cook, an 'English style' seamer whose strengths lie in accuracy and movement, has had to wait for his chance.The former Loughborough University student has taken 318 first-class wickets at an average below 20 and has played three times for England Lions, including on the tour of Australia earlier this year.Realistically, Cook is competing for one spot in the first-choice XI with Woakes. The Warwickshire man is yet to play this season because of an ankle injury.Another option would have been Dan Worrall, who played three one-day internationals and has now qualified to play for England, but the Surrey man has been overlooked.Zimbabwe's last Test in the UK was in 2003, a series famous for the Test debut of Anderson, England's all-time leading wicket-taker.England will be overwhelming favourites to win at Trent Bridge, though the Zimbabweans have just claimed a creditable 1-1 draw in Bangladesh. The five-Test series against India begins on 20 June at Headingley.Highlights of all England's home international cricket and live coverage of The Hundred will be across BBC TV, iPlayer and the BBC Sport website, beginning with England women's T20 international against West Indies on 21 May.Related topicsEngland Men's Cricket TeamEssexZimbabweCricketECB bars transgender women from women's cricketPublished10 hours agoEngland set to start key year with callow attackPublished1 day agoMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished31 January",

        "article_text": "Essex bowler Sam Cook was rested from a Championship match last month at England's request\nEngland look set to begin a defining year with one of their most inexperienced pace attacks in the past two decades when the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe is named on Friday.\nThe England hierarchy have identified the pace department as key to their success in marquee series against India and Australia, but a number of seamers will be unavailable for the one-off Test against the Zimbabweans.\nEngland's two most experienced pacemen, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes, are out injured, while there will be limited expectations for captain Ben Stokes' workload following hamstring surgery.\nThe attack will be led by Gus Atkinson, who had not made his Test debut this time last year and has 11 caps. He is likely to be joined in the squad by Matthew Potts (10 caps), Josh Tongue (two) and uncapped Essex man Sam Cook.\nA combination in the XI of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook would have 13 caps between them. Not since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago has England's pace attack looked so callow at home, when Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Richard Johnson had a combined seven caps.\nIndeed, England have played only one home Test without any of Woakes, Anderson or Stuart Broad in the past 18 years.\nAlthough Zimbabwe are improving \u2013 they have just earned a creditable 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh \u2013 England will be overwhelming favourites to win the four-day Test when it begins on 22 May.\nFollowing that, the five-match series at home to India and the Ashes away in Australia this winter will shape the leadership legacies of Stokes, coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.\n'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nWe've said naive things, but we do care - Wood\nWoakes has not played yet this season because of an ankle problem, while Wood is out until July following knee surgery.\nBrydon Carse remains sidelined with a foot problem and Olly Stone will not play before the back end of the summer after his own knee operation. Ollie Robinson, who has won 20 Test caps, has not played for England in more than a year and lost his central contract in October.\nAll-rounder Stokes, with 210 Test wickets, has more scalps than any other active England bowler, though his bowling is likely to be restricted. An injury sustained in the third Test against New Zealand in December was the second time in five months the talismanic captain had hurt his left hamstring.\nStokes will look to build his bowling in the run-up to the India series, when England will hope to have Woakes and Carse available. Jofra Archer could play his first red-ball game in four years for England Lions against India A in June. Speaking on Wednesday, Wood did not rule out a return for the conclusion of the India series.\nFor now, Atkinson will lead the attack following his stunning debut year in Test cricket while Potts played in England's last Test in New Zealand.\nTongue has not played for England for two years because of injuries but has enjoyed a superb start to the season with Nottinghamshire.\nCook, 27, has been the outstanding bowler in domestic cricket for some time, grabbing 318 first-class wickets at an average under 20.\nHe is not blessed with high pace and has had to wait for his chance, yet an indication an England call-up was on the horizon came when it was requested he be rested from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire last month.\nIf England feel they want further pace cover in the squad, it could come from 20-year-old left-armer Josh Hull, who made his Test debut last summer, or Hampshire's exciting prospect Sonny Baker. Baker has played only three first-class matches but was given an England development contract in February.\nOther areas of selection look more straightforward. Jamie Smith will return behind the stumps after missing the tour of New Zealand on paternity leave, while there is no suggestion Shoaib Bashir's place as the number one spinner is under threat.\nAny decisions over the top five will be delayed by Jacob Bethell's stint at the Indian Premier League. If batting cover is required, Jordan Cox has recovered from the broken thumb that prevented his debut in New Zealand and Durham opener Ben McKinney is highly rated.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "Lando Norris won the Miami sprint race on Saturday before the qualifying session\nMiami Grand Prix\nVenue: Miami International Autodrome Date: 4 May Race start: 21:00 BST on Sunday\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live from 20:00; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app\nMcLaren's Lando Norris said he was \"very happy\" after qualifying at the Miami Grand Prix, despite losing out on pole position to Max Verstappen.\nNorris ended up 0.065 seconds from the Red Bull driver and, while his satisfaction was mixed with some frustration, it was based on his feeling that he has made progress with some of the problems with which he has been struggling this season.\nThe Briton has been open about the fact he finds his McLaren car does not 'talk to him' in the way he would like when being pushed to the absolute limit on a qualifying lap.\nAnd while he again made a mistake that he felt cost him pole position, their communication has been better this weekend at the Hard Rock Stadium.\nNorris, who won Saturday's sprint race, said that \"Max did a Max lap once again and I can't fault him\". So in the context of that, and his own weekend, second was not too bad.\n\"I'm very happy with the end result,\" Norris said. \"Just a shame when you miss out on pole, so that's the only frustrating bit.\n\"But I've been trying different things, I've been doing different things with the team to try and work a bit more in this area and things have been taking a step forward. So I'm happy. Maybe not quite there yet, but happy with the progress.\"\nVerstappen beats Norris to Miami pole\nNorris wins Miami sprint with help from safety car\nHis team-mate Oscar Piastri, too, felt he should have been in the fight for pole with Verstappen.\nBut the Australian, leading the championship by nine points after his third victory of the season in Saudi Arabia last time out, said he was fourth because of \"poor execution\".\nPiastri added: \"The gap has always been close, and our advantage has been a little more on Sundays, but our picture of where we stand is that if we make mistakes we are going to be beaten and that's been true through the year.\"\nTeam principal Andrea Stella says McLaren have now seen enough of a pattern to work out what has been happening to allow Verstappen to take three poles in six races.\n\"We have now enough statistics to confirm what was already our initial impression in Bahrain during the (pre-season) test,\" Stella said, \"that the car was easier to exploit in terms of performance in race simulation runs, rather than on a single lap with qualifying trim and new tyres.\n\"We have seen that pretty much so far we haven't had any perfect lap.\n\"We are definitely trying to assess on a solid engineering basis our understanding so that we can make some adjustments that our drivers can test to see if we can give them a car that is just slightly more predictable and rich of information in terms of how the grip is when driving the car at the limit.\"\nHe added: \"Just to make sure that my point is clear, it's a car that doesn't give you much 'cueing', which is the technical word we use, and this means that it's not easy for our drivers to repeat some big performances that we can see in individual laps.\"\nUpgrades are coming to try to solve this, and Red Bull have their own in Miami, a new floor that is the first of a number of developments they hope will allow Verstappen to challenge the McLaren drivers more consistently in races.\n\"What we are trying to achieve of course is a better balance in the car,\" Verstappen said. \"Now this track is not always the easiest to say that you have improved or nailed something because it's just a really weird layout I would say. So it takes a bit more time.\n\"But for sure it was not negative. And yeah, from here we can work and try to improve it further because from my feeling, of course, we're not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight.\"\nNorris beat team-mate Oscar Piastri to victory in the sprint race, narrowing the gap between them in the drivers' championship by one point\nIn McLaren's view, Red Bull have not been painting the most accurate picture of the competitive picture between the two teams.\n\"Red Bull, they are very good at making fast cars,\" Stella said. \"They are very exceptionally good, I would say, at driving fast cars, and they are extremely good also in creating the narrative to their advantage.\n\"They exploit every possible opportunity to stay in the competition, and some of these opportunities sometimes is to create the narrative, like, 'oh, we are making miracles here, the others should win every single practice session and qualifying and race.'\n\"This is the narrative created by some of our competitors, which we read occasionally and then we change the page and we focus on ourselves.\"\nThe grid sets up an intriguing race. The title contenders are in reverse order, with an interloper between Norris and Piastri in the form of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\nAnd Norris scents an opportunity to nail his first victory since the opening race of the season in Australia back in March.\nIn qualifying, he made errors at the last corner on both his laps, each time costing about 0.2secs, so he knows the pace is in the car.\n\"Max has always been good in qualifying and as a team we have struggled a little more in qualifying, whether that's set-up or what, I'm not too sure,\" Norris said.\n\"We know the Red Bulls are running high downforce, which allows them especially with the DRS (in qualifying) to be a lot more competitive. But it's a long race and we know we have good pace in both conditions.\n\"I don't just expect competition from Max. Kimi's been quick all weekend and Oscar has been as well. So yeah, I just expect a tough race from all accounts.\"\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nAndrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions",

The second McLaren of Lando Norris was third ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, just 0.055secs behind his team-mate.\nAntonelli's team-mate George Russell was fifth fastest, 0.309secs slower than the Italian rookie.\nIt was an outstanding performance from Antonelli, the first time he has beaten Russell in qualifying this season, and the first time he has shown a glimpse of the huge potential Mercedes believed they saw in him when they chose him to replace Lewis Hamilton for this year.\n'Not nice' to see Hamilton struggling - Russell\nAntonelli ready for 'big responsibility' of replacing Hamilton\nHow to follow Miami Grand Prix on the BBC\nAntonelli has taken a steady approach to the start of his career before this weekend, keen not to make a big mistake that could hurt his weekend.\nBut at the Hard Rock Stadium he looked sure-footed and accomplished from the start of practice and carried that form into qualifying.\n\"I am over the moon,\" he said. \"I did not expect it.\n\"I was feeling good in the car. I was able to improve lap by lap and find that consistency and that gap came all together. I am super happy with that. We will enjoy this moment but I want to focus on tomorrow because I really want to try to repeat myself.\"\nAntonelli embraced his father Marco in the Mercedes garage as the team celebrated his achievement wildly.\n\"It was really nice and also to find him in the garage after qualifying,\" Antonelli added.\n\"I am super-happy to share this moment with him. It is so important to me, he is like a rock. I can always rely on him. I would like to share it with my mum and sister as well but hopefully next time.\"\nStarting the sprint from pole gives him a big opportunity to convert it into a first win, given the power of clear air in F1.\nThis video can not be played\nFive things to watch at Miami Grand Prix\nAntonelli's previous highest grid position this season was fifth.\nPiastri, 10 points ahead of Norris in the championship heading into this weekend, said he believed a lock-up at the last corner on his final lap had cost him pole.\nNorris, who crashed in qualifying at the last race in Saudi Arabia, said: \"Close qualifying. It felt good, happy just to get a good lap in there.\n\"Today's performance was in a good ballpark, not good enough but shows how close it is and how quick the Mercedes are. Close enough that we can still aim for a pole tomorrow.\"\nAntonelli's impressive 0.309secs margin over Russell came despite the Briton joining Verstappen in being the only driver to use two sets of tyres over two runs in the final session. Everyone else waited in the pits while they went out and did just one lap.\nThe idea behind the strategy, which is tight in terms of planning because of the fast turnaround needed in the pits after the first lap, is to allow the driver to record a 'banker' lap and then go all out on the second.\nBut it worked for neither.

She was studying it, and then said 'it's OK dad, I don't think they can see me crying'.\n\"That's all she was worried about.\"\nRory McIlroy beat Justin Rose in a dramatic play-off to win the Masters in April\nFor years, McIlroy had faced questions over whether he could complete the career Grand Slam.\nThere had been missed opportunities to claim the iconic green jacket - most notably after an infamous final-round collapse in 2011. \nDespite his talent and self belief, the 35-year-old admitted to wondering if he had missed his opportunity.\n\"You start to think if it is ever going to be your time,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a good message in there about never giving up and keep coming back. \n\"Be strong, be resilient and that patience paid off.\"\nThe Northern Irishman held a two-shot lead going into the final round, and said he had learnt lessons from his 2011 collapse, when he let a four-stroke advantage slip away.\n\"I wanted to make everything else irrelevant. I'm not going to look at what my playing partner is doing, I'm not going to look at the leaderboard. \n\"I was going to try and get in my own world. If I can shoot four-under-par, I'm going to win the Masters. \n\"I felt like I lost the Masters in 2011 because I started to look around and started to do maths in my head.\n\"If you give yourself a target and objective, that's all you can do.\"\nSir Elton John wanted to congratulate McIlroy on his Masters success - but he doesn't have a mobile phone\nUnsurprisingly, McIlroy has been contacted by famous people from all walks of life since his win at Augusta.\nHe said he was \"super humbled\" by those who had been in touch, but one famous musician stood out.\nSir Elton John needs little introduction - but there was one little problem.\n\"I actually haven't been able to connect with him yet.

That is what Barcelona and Inter Milan served up in an enthralling 3-3 draw in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.\n\"It was an amazing battle to watch, almost like a boxing match where opposing styles make the fight,\" said former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock.\n\"Barca and Inter were set up very differently, and it made for one heck of a game.\"\nFormer Rangers striker Ally McCoist said on TNT Sport: \"Tonight was just special, special to be here to watch those two teams.\n\"We have been treated to some unbelievable football this evening.\"\nSensational goals, high drama and incredible individual performances - it had everything. Here's how an engrossing evening of football unfolded.\nMuch of the talk in the build-up to this match was around Barcelona.\nTheir dangerous high line, their ability to score an abundance of goals with a prolific front three, the prospect of another golden generation of players nurtured from their prestigious La Masia academy.\nAfter 30 seconds of the first leg at the Montjuic Olympic Stadium, that all changed.\nMarcus Thuram's clever backheel finish was the fastest goal to be scored in a Champions League semi-final and left the home crowd stunned.\nBut against a side capable of scoring lots of goals, Inter knew one would not be enough and the second came on 21 minutes when Denzel Dumfries fired in a remarkable overhead kick to once again silence the home crowd.\nThat was not in the script for a Barcelona side trying to reach the Champions League final for the first time in 10 years.\n\"I think everyone thought that once Inter went 2-0 up, that would be it \u2013 they would shut up shop, and we wouldn't see much other than another outstanding defensive display by them,\" said Warnock.\nInter had conceded just five goals in this season's Champions League and with Barcelona's high-line tactics exposing their own defensive weaknesses, the Serie A side were able to take advantage.\nFor a few minutes, at least.\nTrailing by two after 21 minutes, Barcelona needed an immediate spark.\nEnter Lamine Yamal.\nThe teenager, making his 100th club appearance, took just three minutes to step up for his team and conjure a moment of magic to get them back in it.\nJinking into the penalty box and leaving Henrikh Mkhitaryan in his wake, Yamal struck a majestic left-footed finish that ricocheted off the post and into the net to launch the comeback.\n'Get the ball to Yamal' became a clear tactic for Barcelona and watching him take control of the game, pinging balls into the area and constantly making himself available in forward positions, it was easy to forget he is still just 17 years old.\nThe equaliser came on 38 minutes, when Ferran Torres stabbed in from close range after Raphinha nodded on Pedri's diagonal cross.\nParity restored just in time for the break, the anticipation was heavy after what had been a mesmerising opening 45 minutes.\nFormer Liverpool player Steve McManaman, part of the TNT punditry team, said: \"It had everything. It showed how frail Barcelona are defensively, but going forward they are electric.\"\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nThis video can not be played\nYamal pulls one back against Inter\nWith fans and neutrals alike on the edge of their seats from this gripping encounter, expectations were high for an equally entertaining second half.\nAfter three stunning goals worthy of putting any team in the Champions League final, there was almost an air of disappointment when Inter's goal to restore their advantage came from a simple corner routine.\nDumfries rose highest to meet Hakan Calhanoglu's corner at the back post, highlighting Barca's defensive struggles.\n\"Inter are not the most dynamic team, and they don't have much raw pace but there was still a way for them to hurt Barca, on the break or with set-pieces,\" said Warnock.\n\"They are the oldest squad in the Champions League so there is a lot of experience there and they showed that tonight with the way they were clever enough to keep opening Barca up.\"\nAt 30 years and 56 days, Inter named the seventh oldest starting XI for a Champions League semi-final game and they used all of that experience to keep cool heads in a high-drama scenario.\n\"When you play at home like we did, the sensation is that we should have managed to earn a better result,\" Barcelona forward Raphinha told Movistar Plus.\n\"We can't concede that many goals, especially at home. Sure, you have to give praise to our opponents who are strong and played well tonight but we are Barca and it's our duty to win at home, that's how it is.\"\nSmarting from three consecutive defeats in the past seven days, where they have dropped to second in Serie A and gone out of the Coppa Italia to city rivals AC Milan, Inter were determined not to let the lead slip away again.\n\"Barca were set up to attack and take the game to Inter but their high-line left them vulnerable at the back,\" said Warnock.\n\"They are not going to change that way of playing - they haven't changed all season and they have done well doing it, so why would they?\"\nConceding three goals at home and facing the prospect of travelling to the San Siro with a one-goal deficit, sometimes all you need is someone to take a chance.\nThat is what Raphinha did when he picked up the ball 25 yards out and hammered the ball into the back of the net, via a touch off the bar and goalkeeper Yann Sommer's back.\nInter had held the lead for all of 114 seconds before Raphinha's equaliser drew Barcelona level for the second time in the game.\nYamal might have been the star of the show on Wednesday but it is Raphinha who has dominated the headlines for Barca throughout this campaign and, although the goal has not been credited to the Brazilian, his performances throughout have proved pivotal to their success.\n\"I really appreciate what we did today,\" said Barcelona boss Hansi Flick.\n\"We played a great game, and of course, the goals we conceded weren't pretty. You have to talk about them, analyse them, but the way we played, our style, our way of playing...it was fantastic.\"\nMkhitaryan thought he had found a fourth goal when he poked home in the 75th minute only for the video assistant referee to rule it out for an agonisingly tight offside.\nBut even without that, the game was the joint-highest score draw in a Champions League semi-final game alongside a 3-3 draw between Dynamo Kyiv and Bayern Munich in the first leg in 1998-99.\nIt sets up a mouth-watering second leg in Milan next week and, while Barca may be disappointed to have conceded three goals at home, the visitors will take confidence that they were able to match them on an exhilarating night of football.\n\"After three defeats in a row we saw the real Inter tonight,\" said Inter goalscorer Dumfries. \n\"We played with heart and I'm proud.

        "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his post as national security adviser, and will nominate him as ambassador to the United Nations.\nIn a post on social media, Trump thanked Waltz for his work and said he would be temporarily replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who will continue as America's top diplomat. \nWaltz had faced criticism for mistakenly adding a journalist to a chat group where sensitive military plans were discussed - a political embarrassment likely to feature during confirmation hearings for the UN post. \nThe former Florida congressman is the first senior member of the administration to leave the White House in Trump's second term.\n\"From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \n\"I know he will do the same in his new role.\"\nWaltz posted a short statement on X, alongside a screenshot of the announcement by the president.\n\"I'm deeply honoured to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,\" he wrote.\nAccording to the BBC's US partner CBS News, Trump decided to nominate Waltz as UN ambassador just hours before the announcement on Thursday.\nMultiple sources told the network he was ousted because of the Signal situation and a perception in the White House that he did not properly vet National Security Council staff, among other reasons.\nBut the sources said Trump respects Waltz so he was given a soft landing and a high-profile new post.\nHowever, the BBC spoke to several US officials - who wished to remain anonymous - and they suggested the Trump administration believed Waltz might struggle to be confirmed by the Senate, allowing the president to get rid of him completely without having to fire him. \nWaltz has been under scrutiny since he acknowledged in March mistakenly adding the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a group chat on Signal with top US security officials.\nConfidential plans for a military strike on Yemen's Houthis were discussed on the message chain, whose members included Waltz, Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. \nThere was uncertainty on Thursday over the fate of Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, a seasoned foreign policy hand from Trump's first term who was also on the Signal chat. \nWong was asked about the leak during an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme on Wednesday. He said the administration had been \"very successful\" in taking on Yemen's Houthis and \"the president led on that\".\nIn March, lawmakers questioned some of the other Signal chat participants at hearings, including the director of national intelligence and the director of the CIA.\nThe UN ambassador position remains unfilled. Trump withdrew the nomination of his first pick, New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, amid Republican concerns about preserving their slender majority in the House of Representatives. \nMinnesota Governor and former Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz made light of the national security adviser's exit on Thursday.\nHe posted on X: \"Mike Waltz has left the chat.\"\nWaltz has continued to use Signal, according to an image captured by a Reuters photographer at a White House cabinet meeting on Wednesday.\nThe zoomed-in picture showed Waltz checking his phone and a chat ongoing with a contact saved under the name of JD Vance, who is US vice-president.\nThe message from the Vance contact read in part: \"I have confirmation from my counterpart it's turned off. He is going to be here.\"\nIn an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday evening, Vance rejected any suggestion that Waltz had been fired, saying he was actually being promoted.\n\"I like Mike,\" said Vance. \"I think he's a great guy. He's got the trust of both me and the president.\n\"But we also thought that he'd make a better UN ambassador as we get beyond this stage.\"\nTrump's announcement, meanwhile, of the latest role for Rubio appeared to catch state department officials off guard.\nRubio will now be the first official to serve both as secretary of state and national security adviser since Henry Kissinger half a century ago. \nRubio is also acting head of both the gutted United States Agency for International Development and the National Archives.\nSome reports suggest Steve Witkoff, a real estate developer and personal friend of Trump who is currently a US Special Envoy to the Middle East, could ultimately replace Waltz.\nAnother name being touted as a potential candidate by some in Washington is also one of Trump's special envoys, Ric Grenell, who has a longer diplomatic track record.\nTrump went through four national security advisers in his first term. The first, Michael Flynn, served for just three weeks. \nAnother, John Bolton, later wrote an unflattering book about Trump. \nBolton told the BBC on Thursday that Waltz's removal was reminiscent of the \"chaos\" from Trump's first term.",

It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.\nIn recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.\n\"Tariffs are great,\" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. \"We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic \u2026 Trump's the best thing America ever had.''\nOther spectators are more nuanced.\n\"It's going nuts,\" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. \"I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.\"\nAustralia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency \u2013 and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.\nBut Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world. \nTrump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' \u2013 a value that embodies friendship and loyalty \u2013 and that extends to politics too.\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not \"the act of a friend,\" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.\nAll of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?\nIn the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.\n\"It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,\" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. \"The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.\"\nThe US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China \u2013 and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.\nThe rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.\nIt's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.\nBack in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.\n\"What does that mean?\" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. \"We'll be discussing that \u2026 we've had a very good relationship with Australia.\"\nAustralia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.\nA blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.\n\"We don't have anywhere else to turn,\" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. \"We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.\"\nWhile only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.\n\"This isn't a time to end alliances,\" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. \"That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.\"\nAnd, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.\n\"We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,\" he says. \"Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.\"\nA poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.\nAnd a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.\nBig questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.\nDutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.\n\"He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,\" says Remeikis. \"He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.\"\nDutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president \"a deal-maker \u2026 a big thinker.\"\nAnd he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.\nAlbanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.\nThat may turn out to be in his favour.\nIndeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.\nFor Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.\n\"What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,\" he says. \n\"The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. \"\nBut whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.\n\"We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,\" says Andrews. \"I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism \u2013 so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.\"\nBack at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos \u2013 the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground. \nFlying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

He knows what wins over their neighbours can do when it comes to longevity in the post.\nBut, despite ending an almost five-year wait for a victory at Celtic Park the last time they locked horns, Ferguson's short stint in the hotseat looks to be coming to an end with inauspicious results elsewhere and an inability to win at home.\nPutting it up to Celtic has not been Rangers' problem in recent months.\nThey have won the past two derbies and were a penalty shootout away from winning the League Cup against Brendan Rodgers' side in December.\nThey have scored three goals in three successive games against their old rivals for the first time since 2002 and are chasing a third straight win over them in the same season for the first time since 1996-97.\nAnd yet it feels like Rangers are as far behind Celtic as they've ever been.\nGoals have rained in on them and points have been shed against the other Premiership sides with staggering regularity.\nRangers have only scored once in their previous six games at Ibrox and equally staggering is the fact they have conceded at least twice in 11 of their past 13 overall.\nWhat chances a Rangers guard of honour for Celtic?\nCeltic's Jota ruled out for up to nine months\nCeltic's Scottish league dominance in numbers\nFor Rodgers and his team, there will be a determination, if not a desperation, to come out on top.\nYes, the title has been wrapped up with ease yet again. But those two defeats to Rangers will irk the Celtic boss. There was a time when the outcome of these games indicated where the title was going, that has not been the case this term.\nRodgers' Old Firm record still stands above all others and that is something he will want to maintain.\nHe likes to have records in mind as he goes along and one still to achieve is beating the 106 goals his invincible side scored in 2016-17 during his maiden season at Parkhead. Celtic are five away from achieving that having scored five in each of their past three matches.\nHaving secured honour number 11 as Celtic boss, Rodgers has moved himself into sixth place in Scottish Football's managerial roll of honour. He now stands behind only Willie Maley, Bill Struth, Jock Stein, Smith and Scot Symon. The latter two are catchable if Rodgers plans on sticking around for the next few seasons.\nFor Ferguson, he has three more chances to register a victory at Ibrox with the club setting an unwanted benchmark of six home games without one.\nThe 47-year-old will have spent many a night since replacing Phillipe Clement wondering why this group of players can beat Celtic twice yet lose to Queen's Park, St Mirren, Motherwell and Hibernian on their own patch.\nNot all of those have come on his watch but Ferguson knows it is a level of ignominy that won't wash at Rangers and if it is to be the end of his spell in charge, he will personally want a 100% record from his games against Celtic.\nWhatever the outcome of this one, it won't register on the Richter scale but the phrase \"dead rubber\" doesn't really apply when it comes to these best of enemies.",

        "article_text": "Labor's Anthony Albanese has defied the so-called \"incumbency curse\" to be re-elected Australia's prime minister in a landslide.\nOfficial vote counting won't finish for days, but Albanese's centre-left government will dramatically increase its majority after the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide.\n\"Today, the Australian people have voted for Australian values: for fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all; for the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need,\" Albanese said.\nCoalition leader Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of 24 years, said he accepted \"full responsibility\" for his party's loss and apologised to his MPs.\nFollowing the result, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio both said they looked forward to deepening their bilateral relationships with Australia.\nCost-of-living concerns - particularly the affordability of healthcare and housing - dominated the five-week campaign, but international relations also reared its head, with the issue of how to deal with Donald Trump looming large over the election.  \nDutton was seen by many as Australia's Trump, which appeared to go down badly with voters, despite his attempts to shake off comparisons made between his policies on immigration, public sector cuts and China, and the Trump administration. \nLabor has seen swings towards them right across the country \u2013 a rare feat for a second-term government in Australia - and Albanese becomes the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years.\nThe party's success has also tempered a trend of voters abandoning the two major parties, which was the big story of the last election in 2022.\nLabor is on track to finish with 86 seats, the Coalition about 40, and the Greens Party with one or two, according to projections by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Other minor parties and independents are ahead in nine seats.\nThat represents an increase of nine for Labor and a significant drop in support for the Greens. However most \"teal\" independents have been returned in their more conservative, inner-city electorates.\nIt's a remarkable turnaround from the start of the year, when polling put Albanese's popularity at record lows after three years of global economic pain, tense national debate, and growing government dissatisfaction.\nIn his Saturday night victory speech, Albanese addressed some of the election's key issues, which also included migration, climate change and energy. \nHe reiterated his promises to make healthcare - most critically GP appointments - more affordable, put buying a house in reach for more Australians, and do more to address climate change and protect the environment.\nNotably, he also vowed to advance reconciliation for First Nations people: \"We will be a stronger nation when we Close the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\"\nIt's a veiled reference to the biggest moment of Albanese's tenure, the failed Voice referendum of October 2023, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution, and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.\nAustralia remains the only Commonwealth country to have never signed a treaty with its Indigenous people.\nThe Voice was one of Albanese's most defining policies, and his most striking setback - it was overwhelmingly rejected after months of often toxic and divisive national debate.\nIndigenous Australians have told the BBC  they feel like they've been forgotten by policymakers since.\nThe prime minister also found difficulty trying to walk a middle path on the Israel-Gaza war, raised eyebrows after buying a multi-million dollar beach pad in the midst of a housing crisis and, like other leaders globally, he grappled with tough economic conditions.\nWith tanking poll numbers, Albanese was broadly seen as the underdog coming into the election, and was poised to be the next victim of the \"incumbency curse\" \u2013 a term to explain a global trend where struggling constituents were turfing out governments after a single term.\nDutton, on the other hand, looked like he was writing a great political comeback - he was on the edge of bringing his party from its worst loss in 70 years back into office in a single term.\nIt has been almost a century since a first-term government has failed to win re-election, but as Australian National University  Emeritus Professor John Warhurst said: \"Dutton entered the campaign [year] in front. It was his to lose.\"\nInstead tonight Dutton has overseen a party loss so emphatic he has lost his own electorate of Dickson, to Labor's Ali France.\n\"I love this country and have fought hard for it,\" he told supporters in Brisbane, conceding defeat.\n\"We have been defined by our opponents in this election which is not a true story of who we are, but we will rebuild from here and we will do that because we know our values, we know our beliefs, and we will always stick to them.\"\nHis campaign was marred by unforced errors: including a series of policy backflips which caused confusion, awkward mistakes on important issues like cost of living and, perhaps most memorably, accidentally booting an AFL ball into a cameraman's head.\n\"The opposition has been shambolic,\" Prof Warhurst says.\nBut the government - while resolute and disciplined in its campaign - was timid. It's strategy was largely allowing voters to judge Dutton and his party, rather than advancing bold or convincing policies, analysts say.\nAnd that's something we heard from voters throughout the campaign too.\nWhile the Coalition turns to licking its wounds and choosing its next leader, it will again have to reckon with its direction.\nLast election, analysts and some of the party's own MPs cautioned against a move towards the right. They questioned whether Dutton \u2013 a polarising figure considered by many to be a conservative hard man \u2013 was the right person to rebuild support, particularly in the moderate areas where they lost a lot of it.\nAfter a campaign which in its dying days ventured into culture war territory and what some say are \"Trumpian\" politics, the Coalition is going to have to ask those questions again \u2013 and if they want to be competitive, perhaps find different answers.\n\"We have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid from the fire hose and we need to have a serious review... we delude ourselves that we are just a few tactical devices away from winning an election,\" former Liberal strategist Tony Barry told the ABC.\nBut meanwhile Labor has to decide what it wants to achieve with the large mandate Australia has handed them.\nAlbanese's \"incumbency curse\" turned out to be a gift, with international uncertainty appearing to have swayed voters in countries like Canada away from change. Likewise, Australia voted for stability.\nLabor struck a \"middle-of-the-road path\" with its a policy platform, but can now afford to be braver, says Amy Remeikis, chief politicial analyst at the Australia Institute think tank.\n\"That was the path that they took to the election, and that is what they are seeing has paid dividends for them. But the question now is: 'Will Labor actually do something with power?'\"",

        "article_text": "In January a migrant boat was rescued off the north African coast after 14 harrowing days lost at sea. Some 50 people died on the voyage, many of whom were lied to by people smugglers promising safe and legal routes to Europe. BBC Verify has tracked one of the traffickers responsible - documenting his activities across three continents.\nPunjabi rap music plays over a video showing three men at a beachside restaurant in Mauritania's capital Nouakchott. One after the other, they smile at the camera before casually turning to talk and laugh together.\nThe three are clearly friends. Two of them, Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad, are cousins from rural Pakistan.\nBut it's the third man in particular who dominates the conversation. He's Fadi Gujjar, a people smuggler.\nThe video - posted to Gujjar's TikTok account - is one of more than 450 clips analysed by BBC Verify that reveal clues about his activities and his close relationship to the other men.\nWithin a month of this video being posted online, Ali and Shahzad were dead - beaten to death on the boat journey sold to them by Gujjar, who promised a safe route into Europe.\nMeanwhile, Gujjar found himself on the run, wanted by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for his role in the tragedy.\nWhen BBC Verify contacted him on a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said repeatedly in a series of voice notes his name had been \"misused\" by survivors in connection with the disaster and that he was leaving it all in the hands of Allah.\nFadi Gujjar is from Jaurah in Pakistan's Punjab region. In his 30s, his real name is Khawar Hassan - though he also goes by Bishi Gujjar.\nPakistani smugglers the BBC has previously reported on have tended to boastfully advertise illegal routes to Europe online.\nBut Gujjar is careful. His online presence is limited to highly edited videos of his travels and almost all clients BBC Verify identified are local to Jaurah. Advertisements for his services seem to spread by word of mouth.\nHis current location on Facebook is set to Istanbul, Turkey - an oasis for smugglers looking to make a quick buck. Videos posted to TikTok place him in the city since July 2022, showing the smuggler outside the iconic Hagia Sophia and a Pakistani supermarket.\nOne other location stands out: Mauritania on West Africa's Atlantic coast - the nerve-centre of his operation and the place from which the migrant boat started its perilous journey.\nSince 2023, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says Mauritania has become a hub for people smuggling - spurred on by a crackdown on other routes.\nThe route is deadly. IOM data shows that 170 people - including 14 children - have died or gone missing on it this year.\nMany Pakistanis seeking economic opportunities in Europe are willing to take the risk. Life there is glorified online by migrants already living on the continent. Smugglers like Gujjar, whose lucrative business is fuelled by people's aspirations, take advantage of this.\nThese migrants are taking a gamble, using their families' savings or selling up to make the journey. The survivors we spoke to, on average, say they paid Gujjar $13,000 (\u00a310,000).\nThere are no direct flights from Pakistan to Mauritania, so some of the migrants transited through Ethiopia or the Middle East. From there, almost all of them went on to Senegal, before crossing into Mauritania, either by road or a short boat journey along the Senegal River.\nGujjar's travel history - obtained by BBC Verify through a source - showed the smuggler followed a similar route, entering Dakar airport in Senegal on two occasions in 2024.\nMultiple videos also place him in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott from October 2024 - though the date of upload could differ to when they were filmed.\nFurther clips, posted to TikTok by Ali and Shahzad place Gujjar in Mauritania as early as August 2024. The trio are seen on the rooftops of Nouakchott's sand-coloured buildings and in restaurants around the city - a luxury other migrants couldn't afford.\nVideos from their accounts reveal the men were close, hailing from the same village. Their uncle, Ahsan Shahzad Chaudhry, confirmed to BBC Verify that his nephew Sufian Ali was friends with Gujjar.\nOne survivor named Uzair Bhat said Gujjar falsely promised him safe and legal routes to Europe. He sent BBC Verify proof of funds transferred to a bank account under Gujjar's real name, Khawar Hassan.\nBut when Uzair arrived in Mauritania, the smuggler backtracked.\n\"He said going by air will not work from here. I'll send you by a big ship,\" Uzair recalled. \"Please cooperate, your visa [to Europe] won't come through.\" \nEventually Uzair relented.\nAs well as Ali, Shahzad and Uzair, BBC Verify identified two other migrants who bought journeys from Gujjar.\nOnce they arrived in Nouakchott they say they were placed in \"safe houses\" - a term used for buildings tucked away in obscure alleys where migrants are held illegally by smugglers.\nOne person who used a different agent said he also stayed in safe houses run by Gujjar.\nBBC Verify confirmed the location of one to an area near the port of Nouakchott, which survivors say Gujjar occasionally visited.\nSurvivors BBC Verify spoke to say they set off from Nouakchott in a small fishing boat in the early hours on 2 January. Most of those onboard bought passage from smugglers in their hometowns in Pakistan.\nBut the three day trip turned into a deadly two-week journey adrift at sea. \nUzair said that from the day they left port the migrants \"were constantly scooping water out of the boat\". Another man, Bilalwal Iqbal, recalled that passengers soon began \"drinking sea water and after drinking it, people became delirious\".\nAccording to the survivors, the crew onboard - West Africans employed by the smugglers - starved the Pakistani migrants of food and water, and beat them daily.\n\"I tried to take one of their bottles of water so they hit me on the head with a rope and the impact just made me fall back,\" Iqbal told BBC Verify. \"Then they pummelled my thumbs with a hammer. I still have those wounds.\"\nSufian Ali and Atif Shahzad died after being beaten to death by the crew, their uncle said. He was informed of the circumstances surrounding their deaths by survivors.\nOthers died of starvation, dehydration and hypothermia.\nThose still alive, including the crew, had given up until they saw a much larger fishing vessel come into view. Uzair Bhat jumped into the ocean and swam towards it for help.\nThe coastguard instructed the vessel to take the migrant boat to Dakhla port - 60 miles away. According to the IOM, 15 dead bodies were found onboard while 35 people remain missing at sea and presumed dead.\nPakistani authorities have named Gujjar as one of ten smugglers involved in the tragedy.

The 28-year-old told the BBC that he was drawn to the party because of its focus on housing and the cost of living. \n\"We're getting stuck in a system right now that doesn't seem to be working,\" he said. \"It worked for our parents, but not for us.\"\nHe added that he has grown \"tired of the same Liberal policies for the last 10 years\".\nAhead of the election, support for the Conservatives outpaced the Liberals by 44% to 31.2% among 18 to 34 year olds, a Nanos poll on 25 April indicated. \nThe issues that resonated with Canadians depended on age, too. Carney campaigned heavily on standing up to Trump, while affordability and a broken \"Canadian promise\" were central to Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre's message. \nAbacus Data polling indicated about 18% of 18 to 29 year olds were worried about Trump. That jumped to 45% for voters over 60, suggesting a diversion on key issues between generations.\nA big challenge for Carney and the Liberals will be how they can win back the confidence of  those younger voters, Mr Coletto said, who \"feel really let down and frustrated\".\nIn Monday's election, the Liberals managed to gain more than a dozen seats in a historic comeback election. \nBut the rival Conservatives also made significant gains - enough to block the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government.\nThe Liberals won 169 seats, three shy of a majority, and captured 43% of the popular vote. The Conservatives won 144 seats - 25 more than the previous 2021 election - and 41% of the popular vote.\nSmaller parties, namely the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), suffered significant losses as voters migrated to the two larger parties.\nCarney's platform did feature proposals on how to tackle affordability, including a pledge to build 500,000 homes annually and a small income tax cut for some Canadians.\nLaura Stephenson, chair of the political science department at Western University, noted the two platforms were not too different on cost of living issues.\n\"It is a question of differences in degree, rather than completely different approaches,\" Prof Stephenson said.\nIn his victory speech, Carney preached a message of unity as he acknowledged the millions of Canadians who cast ballots for other parties.\n\"My message to every Canadian is this: no matter where you live, no matter what language you speak, no matter how you voted, I will always do my best to represent everyone who calls Canada home,\" he said.\nCarney will also face a restive western Canada, where there is a festering sense of alienation from the power centre in Ottawa. \nThose tensions were on display quickly after the election. In a post congratulating Carney, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said Poilievre's vision \"inspired millions\", while the Liberals had \"demonized and demeaned\" her oil-rich province.\nShe called on Carney to \"reset the relationship between Ottawa and Alberta with meaningful action rather than hollow rhetoric\".\nWithout a majority, Carney will also have to work with other party leaders to get legislation passed. The Liberals could try to convince members of the NDP - and even the Conservatives - to cross the aisle, which could turn their strong minority to a majority.\nForming an effective government, as well binding regional and demographic fractures in Canada, is now one of the many items on Carney's to-do list. \nAdditional reporting by Jessica Murphy and Ali Abbas Ahmadi in Toronto.",

        "article_text": "Ohio's Cuyahoga River used to be so polluted it regularly went up in flames. Images of one dramatic blaze in 1952 shaped the US's nascent environmental movement, long after the flames went out.\nThe last time Ohio's Cuyahoga River notably caught fire was 22 June 1969. At midday, debris floating in an oil slick on the river ignited after sparks fell from a nearby passing train. While locals reported the flames reached five stories high, firefighters extinguished them in less than 30 minutes. Two railroad trestles sustained a total of $50,000 in damage ($428,500 in today's money, or \u00a3321,000). But the event was over before reporters could arrive.\n\"All we have photographically of the Cuyahoga fire in '69 is pictures of firemen mopping up, spraying the trestle, and then Carl Stokes,\u00a0the mayor, on the tracks\u00a0the next morning talking to the press about it,\" says David Stradling, professor of history at the University of Cincinnati, US. Earlier images of fires on the same river, such as that pictured above in 1952, nevertheless began to be circulated when the 1969 blaze occurred.\u00a0\nAnd yet, this short-lived fire on the Cuyahoga River became a powerful moment in the growing environmental activism movement in the United States. The images of the river's previous fires ignited national conversations on pollution and social justice, just as the US's nascent environmental movement was gathering pace.\nThe history of the river's dire pollution stretches back long before its final blaze. By the late 1800s, Cleveland and the Cuyahoga had become a hub for the Industrial Revolution. Stradling says it started with steel mills towards the head of navigation (the farthest point upstream on a river where boats can travel, often defined by a dam or other physical barrier). The river made it easy for boats to transport ore. \"Once the steel industry became established in Cleveland, all these other ancillary industries were good to have nearby,\" he says.\nWith all of this steel production came excess chemicals and grease, says Stradling, and since there were virtually no environmental regulations at the time, a lot of it ended up in the river, along with raw sewage.\n\"We didn't treat our wastewater, so anything that you flushed down the toilet was piped straight into the river,\" says Adam Schellhammer, Mid-Atlantic regional director of the non-profit, American Rivers. Then, in the early 1900s amid World War One, industrialisation ramped up and the river pollution got worse. \"With that uptick in manufacturing, these rivers were bearing the brunt of all that, and there were no restrictions on what went in,\" says Schellhammer.\u00a0\nBy the 1930s, the Cuyahoga had essentially become an open sewer, infamous for its foul smell and telltale sheen of oil slick. Unsurprisingly, the fauna that typically reside in and around the river steered clear, or died. \"The Cuyahoga was a completely dead river for decades,\" says Stradling. \"There were no fish, no water fowl.\" Those who lived nearby cautioned that if you fell in, you had to be rushed to the hospital.\u00a0\nAnd, occasionally, the massively polluted river burned.\nThe first fire on the river was in 1868, and there were at least 12 subsequent fires, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The biggest ones occurred in 1936, 1941, 1952 and 1969.\nLocal protests and dogged advocacy by Mayor Carl B. Stokes had already led to a $100m bond for river cleanup passing in 1968 (equivalent to more than $900m today). When the river burned again in 1969, Stokes acted quickly.\u00a0\n\"It was a right place, right time situation,\" says Anne Vogel, former director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and current EPA region 5 administrator. \"Cleveland was also a place, at the time, where environmental and social situations intersected.\"\nStokes was the first black mayor of a major city in the US, and he was acutely aware of how racial inequality in the industrialised parts of Cleveland was reflected in the water pollution issue since poorer, predominantly black communities lived in those areas.\n\"He's a black man in a majority white city surrounded by almost entirely white suburbs,\" says Stradling. \"So he doesn't have a whole lot of political allies, but he could have allies in the press who can get things before the people and talk about the Cuyahoga as a regional problem, not just Cleveland's problem.\"\nConnecting the social and environmental challenges of the area marks him out as forward-thinking in his work on what came to be called environmental justice, says Stradling. \"There's no point in working on public health if you're not going to solve water and air pollution problems.\"\nTo drive the point home, Stokes gave a much-photographed pollution tour to reporters the day after the 1969 river fire. The tour went beyond Cleveland's confines to showcase the surrounding area's sewer system. He was making it abundantly clear that in order to clean up the Cuyahoga, the city would need help from its neighbours and the federal government. Convincing the neighbouring suburbs was the real challenge, says Stradling, since they weren't as aware of the pollution accumulating downstream.\nOn that tour was Betty Klaric, one of the US's earliest specialist environmental reporters, writing for the Cleveland Press, who dedicated much of her career to reporting on the health of the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie, which the river feeds. Her reporting of the 1969 fire was resurfaced several times by more prominent, national publications.\nStradling recalls a compelling photo of Stokes and reporters standing on a railroad bridge after the fire, its metal distorted from the heat. In the image, Stokes is talking to Klaric. \"There are a whole bunch of other press around, including the television [crews] with their cameras, but I just love that that photograph is of him talking to Betty, because I think he knew that she was the most important person besides him on that bridge,\" he says.\nThe story reported by Klaric and others was soon picked up nationally. A 1969 Time magazine spread on water pollution reproduced images of the earlier blaze on the river in 1952 \u2013 a menacing frontline of flames and black, billowing smoke engulfing a tug boat as it fights to contain a raging fire on the oil-slicked water (the same 1952 image is reproduced at the start of this article). Long, powerful streams of water from firefighters on a nearby bridge cascade over the river, offering backup.\n\"It was late summer when Time magazine ran a story about water pollution in the United States,\" says Stradling, who co-wrote Where the River Burned, a history of the infamously polluted Cuyahoga, with his brother Michael Stradling. \"[The article] mentioned lots of places, but one that was mentioned most frequently was the Cuyahoga River and how it had become a fire hazard.\" The book notes that Time did not clarify that the photos of the fire had been taken 17 years prior, and it remains unclear whether the publication \"mistakenly used the older photo or did so deliberately, perhaps thinking the more dramatic scene would grab readers' attention\". (Time magazine was contacted for clarity on the matter, but did not respond by the time this article was published.)\nThe photo of the 1952 fire came to symbolise how waterway pollution in the US had grown out of control, and it fed the flames of public outcry over environmental crises. \"It was a culmination of events, and the Cuyahoga [fire] was so visible that the calls for unified approaches to environmental protection could not be ignored any longer,\" says Schellhammer.\nWhile the first Earth Day,\u00a0on 22 April 1970, is considered the official start of the environmental movement in the US, the idea had been planted years earlier in 1962 with the release of Rachel Carson's book on the misuse of pesticides, Silent Spring. Eight years later, when 20 million people marched to advocate for nationwide environmental protections, US President Richard Nixon responded by establishing the EPA.\nThe Cuyahoga River's ongoing recovery\n1952: Cuyahoga River's most damaging fire\n1969: Cuyahoga River's last major fire\n1970: EPA established\n1972: Clean Water Act\n1986: River otters reintroduced to several Ohio rivers, including the Cuyahoga\n1987: Cuyahoga River designated Area of Concern (AOC) under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement\n2006: Bald eagles return to the Cuyahoga area\n2009:\u00a0Great Lakes Restoration Initiative begun by EPA\n2019: Conditions improve enough to lift restrictions on consuming Cuyahoga fish\n2020: Breckville Dam removed\n2022: First natural trumpeter swan nest seen on the Cuyahoga\nTwo years after that, the\u00a0Clean Water Act\u00a0followed, which laid the groundwork for the restoration of the Cuyahoga. While not a direct cause and effect, the river fires are\u00a0often\u00a0cited\u00a0as the prime example of water pollution at its worst in the US. The Cuyahoga River in particular, Schellhammer and others note, comes up time and again in this context. But Stradling adds that it was far from alone \u2013 as the Clean Water Act was being formulated, most members of Congress named a river in their jurisdiction that needed protection.\nThe\u00a0Clean Water Act\u00a0was actually an amendment to the existing\u00a0Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which was passed in 1948, but the changes to the framework were so significant that it took on a new name.\u00a0\n\"It put restrictions and parameters on what could be discharged,\" says Schellhammer. \"There was a set limit. Out of that [came] the\u00a0Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, also enacted in 1972, which framed what the entire area needed to do to clean up that river.\"\u00a0\nSchellhammer says the Clean Water Act also acknowledged the need for wastewater treatment, which was virtually nonexistent before then. One new initiative that stemmed from the Act was connecting more of Cleveland's suburbs to an\u00a0expanded sewage treatment plant, something Stokes had long argued for.\nThen, the industries in the city began to clean up their act. \"Mills were already investing in some technologies that would dramatically decrease the amount of problematic effluent that went into the river, so that was really helpful,\" says Stradling. \"A lot of the most problematic industries [like oil refinement] simply\u00a0closed and left in Cleveland.\"\nThe new environmental restrictions played a significant part in shuttering the factories that supported the steel industry in Cleveland. \"It [was] this balance of regulatory framework, legal precedence and public outcry,\" Schellhammer saysof the industrial retreat.\nDespite these developments, river cleanup on the Cuyahoga was gradual from the 1970s to the late 1980s. \"Water quality definitely improved; we wouldn't call it restored,\" says Schellhammer.\nSome of the river's more significant restoration projects have been dam removals.Dams can be major impediments to the health of a river. They act as bottlenecks, limiting fish migration and increasing turbidity. In 2020, the Breckville Dam, which was initially built to move water into the Ohio and Erie Canals, was taken out.\n\"It was pretty straightforward, but really awesome to show the benefit of that dam removal, because basically you're connecting the water and fish populations of Lake Erie to more upstream habitats,\" says Jennifer Grieser, director of natural resources for Cleveland Metroparks and Cuyahoga Area of Concern board member. \"We immediately started to see more species recruitment throughout the whole length of the river.\" The next big project on the docket is the removal of the over 100-year-old Gorge Dam, considered the largest remaining impediment to the Cuyahoga River's health.\u00a0\nGrieser has overseen the removal of five impairments in the Cuyahoga's Area of Concern, including lifting restrictions on consuming fish from the river in 2019, and also the 50-year anniversary of the 1969 fire. She has four left, which she aims to complete within the next five years.\nYet people are already enjoying the cleaner state of the river. It's now considered a water trail, often dappled with kayakers, anglers and birdwatchers hoping to see blue herons or bald eagles, which returned to the area in 2006. The water is not considered pristine yet, but the \"crooked river\" has come a long way since it caught on fire over half a century ago.\u00a0\n\"That's the amazing thing about this restoration story:i t happened in a lifetime,\" says Grieser.\u00a0\nToday, the US is at another pivotal point for the future health of its natural resources. In March, the Supreme Court weakened the reaches of the Clean Water Act, and the EPA cancelled over 400 grants.\u00a0 \"Federal investments played a huge role in why [the Cuyahoga] River is functional again,\" says Schellhammer. The BBC contacted the EPA for comment but did not receive a response by the time this article was published.\nThe Cuyahoga may have represented how bad water pollution can get, but it became the ultimate comeback story.\n\"If we can come back from that, we can come back from anything,\" says Schellhammer.\n--\u00a0\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X\u00a0and Instagram.",

Images of one dramatic blaze in 1952 shaped the US's nascent environmental movement, long after the flames went out.The last time Ohio's Cuyahoga River notably caught fire was 22 June 1969. Convincing the neighbouring suburbs was the real challenge, says Stradling, since they weren't as aware of the pollution accumulating downstream.On that tour was Betty Klaric, one of the US's earliest specialist environmental reporters, writing for the Cleveland Press, who dedicated much of her career to reporting on the health of the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie, which the river feeds. \"Water quality definitely improved; we wouldn't call it restored,\" says Schellhammer.Getty ImagesThe transformation of the Cuyahoga River's water quality happened in a matter of decades \u2013 but there is still a long way to go (Credit: Getty Images)Some of the river's more significant restoration projects have been dam removals.Dams can be major impediments to the health of a river.",

It looks like Fifa career mode.\"\nAnother claimed: \"I think this may be the most commonly agreed worst tifo of all time given the circumstances.\"\nWhile a third said: \"Arsenal turned down the fans' tifo design request to produce this monstrosity. Champions League semi-final and this was the best they could come up with? So disappointed.\"\nAccording to former England striker Wayne Rooney, working as a TV pundit, the atmosphere at the Emirates on Tuesday was in contrast to the Real Madrid game.\nBefore that match, supporters in each block of the stadium held up red and white cards above their heads.\n\"For Arsenal, I was a bit disappointed with how they played, disappointed with the fans as well,\" Rooney told Amazon Prime.\n\"I thought tonight they were a bit subdued, almost like an anti-climax that they beat Real Madrid and were going to walk into the final and win the competition.\"\nThis video can not be played\nArteta reacts to defeat against PSG in Champions League semi-final\nWhy Arsenal can still reach Champions League final\nArsenal fan writer Laura Kirk: \"One of the fan groups Ashburton Army had raised some money for a tifo which was ultimately rejected by the club, I imagine because the designs were not in keeping with the club's brand but the club haven't actually said anything. \n\"In comparison with what we see elsewhere in Europe, like the one Real Madrid had against us last week, it just felt like a massively missed opportunity to do something amazing.\"\nOli Price-Bates from The Fresh Arsenal Podcast: \"The tifo from the club was certainly a bit underwhelming. The occasion deserved more from the club to help with the atmosphere and fan engagement. \n\"Certainly if Arsenal get to this stage again, they need to be better prepared and involve the fans in the process, not just in tifos but the wider experience and build-up for the match. \n\"Hopefully we won't wait so long for another semi-final and the club will be better prepared to make more impact.\"\nBroadcaster and Arsenal fan Harry Symeou: \"I think the fans were hoping to see something with a bit more of a wow factor. Given there was lots of talk online with regards to some more elaborate, striking designs - you can understand why some felt underwhelmed.\n\"Tifos on the continent tend to be more creative and really can set the scene ahead of a huge occasion. Fan groups, in particular those known as 'ultras' normally have a big input - leading to a higher rate of fan satisfaction. But this is something we don't do well enough in English football generally. If as a club, you're going to take it upon yourselves to both plan and execute such displays, you've got to deliver something with far more imagination than that.\"\nCrystal Palace's tifo prior to their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa.\nManchester United's tifo prior to their Europa League fixture against Lyon.\nAston Villa's tifo prior to their Champions League tie with Paris St-Germain.\n1 of 3\nOn the whole?

That could start with strong home peformance against Fulham.Subs benchAlphonse Areola, West Ham, goalkeeper, \u00a34.2m - Spurs (h)Ben White, Arsenal, defender, \u00a36.1m - Bournemouth (h)Dwight McNeil, Everton, midfielder, \u00a35.1m - Ipswich (h)Neco Williams, Nottingham Forest, defender, \u00a34.5m - Crystal Palace (a)Team total cost: \u00a393.9mThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a \u00a3100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.Player to watchErling Haaland, Manchester City, striker, \u00a314.8mHe's back in training and could be a massive differential in the final weeks .

It looks like Fifa career mode.\"\nAnother claimed: \"I think this may be the most commonly agreed worst tifo of all time given the circumstances.\"\nWhile a third said: \"Arsenal turned down the fans' tifo design request to produce this monstrosity. Champions League semi-final and this was the best they could come up with? So disappointed.\"\nAccording to former England striker Wayne Rooney, working as a TV pundit, the atmosphere at the Emirates on Tuesday was in contrast to the Real Madrid game.\nBefore that match, supporters in each block of the stadium held up red and white cards above their heads.\n\"For Arsenal, I was a bit disappointed with how they played, disappointed with the fans as well,\" Rooney told Amazon Prime.\n\"I thought tonight they were a bit subdued, almost like an anti-climax that they beat Real Madrid and were going to walk into the final and win the competition.\"\nThis video can not be played\nArteta reacts to defeat against PSG in Champions League semi-final\nWhy Arsenal can still reach Champions League final\nArsenal fan writer Laura Kirk: \"One of the fan groups Ashburton Army had raised some money for a tifo which was ultimately rejected by the club, I imagine because the designs were not in keeping with the club's brand but the club haven't actually said anything. \n\"In comparison with what we see elsewhere in Europe, like the one Real Madrid had against us last week, it just felt like a massively missed opportunity to do something amazing.\"\nOli Price-Bates from The Fresh Arsenal Podcast: \"The tifo from the club was certainly a bit underwhelming. The occasion deserved more from the club to help with the atmosphere and fan engagement. \n\"Certainly if Arsenal get to this stage again, they need to be better prepared and involve the fans in the process, not just in tifos but the wider experience and build-up for the match. \n\"Hopefully we won't wait so long for another semi-final and the club will be better prepared to make more impact.\"\nBroadcaster and Arsenal fan Harry Symeou: \"I think the fans were hoping to see something with a bit more of a wow factor. Given there was lots of talk online with regards to some more elaborate, striking designs - you can understand why some felt underwhelmed.\n\"Tifos on the continent tend to be more creative and really can set the scene ahead of a huge occasion. Fan groups, in particular those known as 'ultras' normally have a big input - leading to a higher rate of fan satisfaction. But this is something we don't do well enough in English football generally. If as a club, you're going to take it upon yourselves to both plan and execute such displays, you've got to deliver something with far more imagination than that.\"\nCrystal Palace's tifo prior to their FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa.\nManchester United's tifo prior to their Europa League fixture against Lyon.\nAston Villa's tifo prior to their Champions League tie with Paris St-Germain.\n1 of 3\nOn the whole?

        "article_text": "Sandy Baltimore has played at left-back for Chelsea this season\nChelsea's dominance on English women's football continues as they wrapped up a sixth successive Women's Super League title on Wednesday.\nWith some of the best players in the world on their books, Chelsea showed they remain a class above the rest in manager Sonia Bompastor's first season in charge.\nSuperstar players have taken centre stage in their title win - but who has gone under the radar in another memorable WSL campaign?\nHere are five unsung heroes of Chelsea's title win.\nThe WSL invincibles? Chelsea eye records after sealing another title\nSummer signing Sandy Baltimore arrived in London from Paris St-Germain with bags of experience in the French league and in Europe. \nBut few could have predicted just how impressive the 25-year-old's debut season at Chelsea would be.\nHaving played as a forward at PSG, Bompastor raised eyebrows when she played Baltimore as a left wing-back. \nThat didn't faze Baltimore though, who went on to make 14 appearances, starting 13 and contributing to four goals in her last four games in the WSL.\nShe told BBC Sport in January: \"I have more responsibility defensively. I love football so that's fine, I will play anywhere. \n\"I am known for my attacking. I love to break forward, to dribble and to make runs towards their goal. But I am enjoying it because it's football.\"\nBaltimore's impressive form and consistency kept England left-back Niamh Charles out of the team. \n\"She can defend well, but can also help the team move forward to create opportunities in the box. It's really nice to have a player like her,\" said Bompastor. \n\"I know different players are competing for that left-back position, but for me, she's really performing and helping the team.\n\"She is having success and it's not just in the last few weeks, it was almost from the beginning of the season.\"\nChelsea broke the world record transfer fee to sign USA centre-back Naomi Girma in January.\nBut that only seemed to provide motivation for Nathalie Bjorn, who must have known her position in the team was under threat. \nAlongside captain Millie Bright, Bjorn has provided stability to Chelsea's defence, with only Manchester United conceding fewer goals throughout the campaign.\nAsked if she had gone under the radar this season, Bright said: \"Yeah, definitely. She's been incredible for us and is a vital part of the changing room. \n\"She keeps everyone together and sometimes that goes unnoticed a little bit as well. She has had a fantastic season and is so easy to play alongside. \n\"She just gives everyone confidence. She is such a team player and as long as the team performs and wins, that is all she cares about.\"\nChelsea signed Wieke Kaptein from FC Twente in 2023 and she returned there on loan for the 2023-24 season \nOne of Chelsea's brightest youngsters is Wieke Kaptein, who signed from FC Twente in 2023 and returned there for a season on loan. \nThe 19-year-old has been a surprise standout under Bompastor, often praised for her work off the ball and how she reads the game. \nShe has been trusted in the big matches and given responsibility, starting in key games against Manchester United, Manchester City and Barcelona. \nSpeaking in October, Bompastor said: \"I am so happy to have her in my squad. She has a lot of energy as a person and as a player.\n\"She is someone who always wants to have some advice from the staff and the coaches. She's listening to us.\n\"Even if she is young, she already has a lot of experience as a player.\"\nOne of the biggest changes to the Chelsea side under Bompastor is a consistent number one. \nGoalkeeper Hannah Hampton has stepped up to the task, performing when it matters and picking up the Player of the Match award in their title-winning match against Manchester United. \nBompastor has encouraged her side to play out from the back and adopt a less direct approach, and Hampton's distribution has proven to be vital in that. \n\"Hampton is probably the best keeper with the ball at her feet. Technically she starts off a lot of Chelsea's attacking play,\" said former England striker Natasha Dowie on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nEx-Scotland defender Jen Beattie added: \"She's been huge. You have all the history of Chelsea winning, but it's Hannah Hampton's first season of success. \n\"She has stepped up massively. She has kept them in a lot of games. It's a big jersey to fill but she has been awesome for this team.\"\nAn ever-present of Chelsea's success, Scotland midfielder Erin Cuthbert does not always get the spotlight but she remains a crucial member of the squad. \nThe 26-year-old has been involved in all six of Chelsea's successive title wins and has made almost 150 appearances for the club.\nShe has a habit of popping up in the big moments - scoring in their Women's FA Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool and providing the stoppage-time winner that sealed a 2-1 result at Manchester City in March. \nHer experience and leadership has been evident again this season and she was soaking up their success after Wednesday's latest title win. \nWhat makes her stand out?\n\"It's her mentality. Last season, when they lost at Liverpool and they thought they had thrown the league title away, I remember seeing Cuthbert on the pitch crying,\" said Dowie. \n\"You saw how much it meant to her to win this title, even though they had already won it for four years in a row.

It has been used by Trump to deport Venezuelans to El Salvador on the basis they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang and \"conducting irregular warfare\".\nThe judge said the act only applied when the US was facing an \"armed organised attack\", which it is not.

Already one of the best players in the world - and before he even turns 18.\nA picture that says it all - Getty photographer Michael Regan captured this image of Yamal\n\n\"I don't think I have seen a 45 minutes like that from one individual before in my life. It is unbelievable,\" said TNT Sports pundit Ally McCoist as the players walked off the pitch at half-time.\nInter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi gave Yamal the highest of praise afterwards.\n\"Lamine is the kind of talent that comes along every 50 years, and to see him up close really impressed me,\" he said.\n\"He caused us huge problems because we were supposed to double up on him and it wasn't enough.\"\nBarca boss Hansi Flick said: \"He's special, he's a genius. In the big matches, he shows up.\n\"If it only comes every 50 years like Simone said, I'm glad it's for Barcelona.\"\nBBC pundit Stephen Warnock called him \"a future Ballon d'Or winner\".\nOne of the games of the season has everyone excited about the second leg at the San Siro in Milan next week, a change of pace from Paris St-Germain's hard-fought 1-0 win at Arsenal the day before. \n'A very, very special player' - Yamal, 16, makes Euros history\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nThis video can not be played\nLamine Yamal - The Boy King\nThere was a bit of drama before the game when Yamal appeared to hurt his groin and went down the tunnel during the warm-up, with speculation that he might not play.\nHe did start but had barely had an impact before Inter led 2-0 via two fantastic goals - Marcus Thuram's 30-second backheel flick from a Dumfries cross, and Dutchman Dumfries' flying close-range volley.\nBut then Yamal - who was being double marked - came to life, beating a few Inter players before whipping the ball in off the far post with astonishing ease and confidence.\nMoments later, he beat more defenders on the byeline and slammed in a shot which Inter keeper Yann Sommer tipped on to the bar.\nFerran Torres then capped off a fine team move to get Barca level before the break.\nDumfries, though, got his second with a header to put the Italian side back in front.\nBut moments later Barca were level again as Yamal cleverly dummied a pass and Raphinha lashed a shot in from 25 yards which hit the bar and went in off the back of Sommer for an own goal.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan thought he had made it 4-3 to Inter but his goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.\nYet Yamal almost had the final say, one more memorable moment, when his cross-shot hit the angle of post and bar.\nThis video can not be played\nWarnock on Yamal's 'outrageous' performance against Inter\nIt is tough to even fathom how much Yamal has achieved at his age.\nThis was his 100th Barcelona appearance, and a 22nd goal to go with four in 19 games for Spain.\nYamal has 27 assists too, including two in Saturday's Copa del Rey final extra-time win over Real Madrid.\nMessi and Ronaldo did not make their international debuts until they were 18, while Yamal won Euro 2024 the day after his 17th birthday.\nMessi scored one goal and had no assists before he was 18, with Ronaldo bagging five and four assists.\nYamal is Barcelona's youngest La Liga player (aged 15) and the youngest to score and assist in La Liga for any team.\nHe also holds records for being the youngest Champions League starter, youngest player to score in a knockout game, a quarter-final and now a semi-final.\nYamal is Spain's youngest player and goalscorer and the youngest player and goalscorer in a European Championship.\n'Superstar' Yamal makes more history with Euros triumph\nThis video can not be played\nYamal is a genius, he is special - Flick\nVery few players have had the impact in football by Yamal's age. He will turn 18 in July.\nHe appears to be the closest thing we have seen to Barcelona and Argentina great Messi, now at Inter Miami and arguably the greatest footballer in history.\nThe pair both came through the Barca academy, La Masia, and both play on the right wing.\n\"I don't compare myself to him, because I don't compare myself to anyone - and much less with Messi,\" Yamal told reporters in the build-up to the game, while also describing the Argentine as \"the best player in history\".\nBut Messi was just very, very promising at the age of 17, rather than already regarded as one of the world's best.\nYamal added: \"I don't think the comparison makes sense, with Messi even less - I'm going to enjoy myself, and be myself.\" \nBut he has an unusual bit of history with Messi, who he was photographed with as a baby.\nA photo emerged, external from a charity calendar photoshoot taken at Barcelona's Nou Camp in 2007.\nIn it, a 20-year-old Messi held baby Yamal and helped him have a bath. Yes really.\nThe shoot came about after Unicef did a raffle in the town of Mataro where Lamine's family lived.\n\"We walked down to the city centre and you could tell there is a superstar in this town now in Lamine Yamal,\" said ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand on TNT Sports.\n\"There was a void when Messi left, this kid is doing stuff at 17 we have never seen before.

His goal was outrageous.\n\"It's ridiculous watching Yamal. You know, effectively, what he always wants to do \u2013 he wants to come inside on his left foot. So you over-compensate and he has got the ability to drag it with his left foot on to his right foot, and he can actually put a decent ball in with his right foot too.\n\"He is just a phenomenal talent and I love watching him.\"\nAnd Ferdinand wrote on social media: \"As a pure football talent I'm going as far as to say I think Lamine Yamal is on another level to any player playing the game in the top five leagues in world football.

Chelsea eye records after sealing another title\nSummer signing Sandy Baltimore arrived in London from Paris St-Germain with bags of experience in the French league and in Europe. \nBut few could have predicted just how impressive the 25-year-old's debut season at Chelsea would be.\nHaving played as a forward at PSG, Bompastor raised eyebrows when she played Baltimore as a left wing-back. \nThat didn't faze Baltimore though, who went on to make 14 appearances, starting 13 and contributing to four goals in her last four games in the WSL.\nShe told BBC Sport in January: \"I have more responsibility defensively. I love football so that's fine, I will play anywhere. \n\"I am known for my attacking. I love to break forward, to dribble and to make runs towards their goal. But I am enjoying it because it's football.\"\nBaltimore's impressive form and consistency kept England left-back Niamh Charles out of the team. \n\"She can defend well, but can also help the team move forward to create opportunities in the box. It's really nice to have a player like her,\" said Bompastor. \n\"I know different players are competing for that left-back position, but for me, she's really performing and helping the team.\n\"She is having success and it's not just in the last few weeks, it was almost from the beginning of the season.\"\nChelsea broke the world record transfer fee to sign USA centre-back Naomi Girma in January.\nBut that only seemed to provide motivation for Nathalie Bjorn, who must have known her position in the team was under threat. \nAlongside captain Millie Bright, Bjorn has provided stability to Chelsea's defence, with only Manchester United conceding fewer goals throughout the campaign.\nAsked if she had gone under the radar this season, Bright said: \"Yeah, definitely. She's been incredible for us and is a vital part of the changing room. \n\"She keeps everyone together and sometimes that goes unnoticed a little bit as well. She has had a fantastic season and is so easy to play alongside. \n\"She just gives everyone confidence. She is such a team player and as long as the team performs and wins, that is all she cares about.\"\nChelsea signed Wieke Kaptein from FC Twente in 2023 and she returned there on loan for the 2023-24 season \nOne of Chelsea's brightest youngsters is Wieke Kaptein, who signed from FC Twente in 2023 and returned there for a season on loan. \nThe 19-year-old has been a surprise standout under Bompastor, often praised for her work off the ball and how she reads the game. \nShe has been trusted in the big matches and given responsibility, starting in key games against Manchester United, Manchester City and Barcelona. \nSpeaking in October, Bompastor said: \"I am so happy to have her in my squad. She has a lot of energy as a person and as a player.\n\"She is someone who always wants to have some advice from the staff and the coaches. She's listening to us.\n\"Even if she is young, she already has a lot of experience as a player.\"\nOne of the biggest changes to the Chelsea side under Bompastor is a consistent number one. \nGoalkeeper Hannah Hampton has stepped up to the task, performing when it matters and picking up the Player of the Match award in their title-winning match against Manchester United. \nBompastor has encouraged her side to play out from the back and adopt a less direct approach, and Hampton's distribution has proven to be vital in that. \n\"Hampton is probably the best keeper with the ball at her feet. Technically she starts off a lot of Chelsea's attacking play,\" said former England striker Natasha Dowie on BBC Radio 5 Live.\nEx-Scotland defender Jen Beattie added: \"She's been huge. You have all the history of Chelsea winning, but it's Hannah Hampton's first season of success. \n\"She has stepped up massively. She has kept them in a lot of games. It's a big jersey to fill but she has been awesome for this team.\"\nAn ever-present of Chelsea's success, Scotland midfielder Erin Cuthbert does not always get the spotlight but she remains a crucial member of the squad. \nThe 26-year-old has been involved in all six of Chelsea's successive title wins and has made almost 150 appearances for the club.\nShe has a habit of popping up in the big moments - scoring in their Women's FA Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool and providing the stoppage-time winner that sealed a 2-1 result at Manchester City in March. \nHer experience and leadership has been evident again this season and she was soaking up their success after Wednesday's latest title win. \nWhat makes her stand out?\n\"It's her mentality. Last season, when they lost at Liverpool and they thought they had thrown the league title away, I remember seeing Cuthbert on the pitch crying,\" said Dowie. \n\"You saw how much it meant to her to win this title, even though they had already won it for four years in a row. She is a mentality monster, a key player.\"\nHow Chelsea extended dynasty with latest WSL title\nChelsea secure sixth successive WSL title at Man Utd\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "For just two weeks each spring, a rare violet artichoke is harvested by hand on Venice's northern islands \u2013 and locals go to great lengths to keep it authentic.\nThe water glitters in the sunlight as Venetian farmer Guia da Camerino steers her boat past the briccole, the wooden piles that mark invisible \u2013 to non-Venetians \u2013 lanes through the lagoon. Just a few kilometres north of Venice's warren of tourist-packed streets are the islands of Sant'Erasmo and Le Vignole, known as \"the vegetable garden of Venice\" for their lush, fertile ground \u2013 and for a rare flower that grows for only 10 days a year.\nDa Camerino is one of just four farmers on the island of Le Vignole, and she specialises in the carciofo violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a Venetian type of artichoke plant that produces a local delicacy known as a castra\u00f9ra. The castra\u00f9re are the plant's first buds: small, tight and conical artichokes that are \"castrated\" off the plant \u2013 giving them their name \u2013 in order to allow the botoli, larger buds (and the kind you'd probably find on your plate the rest of the year), to grow in their place.\nSpring is a busy time of year for da Camerino as the violet artichokes come into bloom and must be harvested during a short window of about two weeks, with each plant only producing one castra\u00f9ra a year. The tiny artichokes, half the size of a human palm, are highly prized, both for their rarity and their unique, saline taste.\n\"It's hard to describe the taste if you've never had it before,\" she explains, as we walk through her artichoke fields, the belltowers of Venice visible on the horizon. \"It's initially bitter but transforms into sweetness in the mouth. It's very versatile and easy to eat \u2013 not like a Roman artichoke that you have to peel and prepare laboriously. The castra\u00f9re are so tender that you can eat them raw.\"\nThe castra\u00f9re's rarity means that for years Venetian farmers have had to deal with counterfeit versions coming from elsewhere in Italy. The violet artichoke doesn't just grow in the Veneto \u2013 this species of plant is also grown in Tuscany, Sardinia and Sicily. But any Venetian will tell you that a true Sant'Erasmo artichoke tastes nothing like its terraferma counterparts. That's because the islands are positioned at the lagoon's opening to the Adriatic, which makes the soil distinctively salty \u2013 a salinity that is tempered by rainwater. There's even a festival dedicated to the artichoke (usually on the second Sunday in May) when people travel from all over the lagoon to Sant'Erasmo to eat artichoke dishes, drink artichoke-based spritzes or digestifs and buy entire pallets of the vegetable to take home before the season ends.\nWorld's Table\nBBC.com's World's Table \"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nIt's not easy to coax the flower out of the plant. Everything is done by hand, with no pesticides, and in Venice there's the ever-present danger of an acqua alta (seasonal flooding) that could drown the fields. An artichoke is a perennial plant that has to be cut back every summer in order to grow imperceptibly during the winter months. Now climate change is causing the season to arrive earlier and earlier.\n\"It's very worrying,\" says da Camerino. \"The plant needs nine months to slowly grow. Traditionally, the castra\u00f9re were harvested on 25 April, Saint Mark's Day. But we harvested our first castra\u00f9ra at the beginning of April this year. It's getting hotter earlier and earlier, and the plants won't have time to grow. Eventually, the castra\u00f9re could disappear.\"\nBecause they're so delicate, the castra\u00f9re don't get exported far out of the lagoon and are usually harvested, sold and eaten in the same day. Da Camerino sells directly to restaurants in Venice that \"understand the quality\" of the product. The problem, she says, is that many restaurants in Venice have stopped buying real castra\u00f9re \"because they're expensive and non-local customers can't tell the difference. So they use normal artichokes but pretend they're castra\u00f9re so they can hike up the prices.\"\nHow to try castra\u00f9re\n\u2022 Plan a trip to Venice around mid-April to hit the height of the castra\u00f9re season.\n\u2022 Always ring ahead to see if restaurants are serving them, since it's so dependent on the harvest.\n\u2022 If you want to try preparing them at home, make sure you only buy artichokes with the consorzio's label \u2013 and don't be afraid to grill the seller about where they come from.\n\u2022 If you miss the season, don't worry; you can buy a jar of violet artichokes preserved in oil from Finotello's farm on Sant'Erasmo.\n\u2022 You can also get them in liquid form: the amaro digestif Venesian is made from Sant'Erasmo artichokes. Pick up a bottle to take home at the delicatessen Maramao, which sells local products from its canalside shop in the Cannaregio district.\nAl Covino, a Venice restaurant that focuses on local produce and traditional ingredients recognised by Italy's Slow Food presidium, makes a point of serving the castra\u00f9re when they come into season. It's a cosy space with pistachio-green roof beams, hanging plants and only 15 covers, hidden on a small street in the city's Castello neighbourhood and run by husband-and-wife team Claudio De Lauzieres and Claudia Torcellan. De Lauzieres, a Neopolitan who has been living in Venice for 12 years,\u00a0rhapsodises about the local ingredients with a boyish enthusiasm: \"Neapolitan cuisine is much more well-known than Venetian cuisine, but the lagoon offers so many different environments and unique tastes. The castra\u00f9re symbolise the richness of the land here.\"\nHe prepares three castra\u00f9re dishes: a silky, gently saut\u00e9ed version that doesn't just melt on the tongue but entirely disappears, leaving a subtly sweet aftertaste; tagliolini in a velvety artichoke sauce; and raw shavings of the vegetable in a salad with oil, parmesan and a hint of lemon zest. He watches my face as I take a bite of the salad and grins at my expression of surprise at the tiny bud's powerful taste. Its flavour instantly takes me back to da Camerino's boat and the smell of the salty lagoon air whipping past my face.\nOn Sant'Erasmo, local farmer Carlo Finotello has been working for years to crack down on the falsely labelled castra\u00f9re that appear in markets and shops across the lagoon. He runs the farm I Sapori di Sant'Erasmo with his brother Claudio and is also the president of the Consorzio del Carciofo Violetto di Sant'Erasmo, a consortium created in 2004 to promote the local violet artichoke. Its label is a mark of quality and authenticity.\n\"Some vegetable sellers take the consorzio label and stick it on other crates of normal artichokes,\" Finotello explained. \"Or they will buy some castra\u00f9re but then mix them in with normal artichokes so they're still making a bit extra.\"\nWhen the consortium receives a tip-off about producers passing off Tuscan artichokes as the Sant'Erasmo version, Finotello contacts them directly to ask them to desist \u2013 but the consortium isn't a policeman, he says, and they have no power to issue fines, nor the time or money to take them to court. He says that it's vital to only buy castra\u00f9re from a local producer, and to always make sure that they have the consortium's label, in order to protect the centuries-old tradition of growing them.\nMore like this:\n \u2022\u00a0Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n \u2022\u00a0The return of Sicily's ancient 'white gold'\n \u2022\u00a0Where to savour Rome's hidden Jewish food\nI visit Finotello at his farm to see him harvest the castra\u00f9re. It's a muggy day with a hot, salty breeze, and the earth is springy after days of rain. The artichoke plants are slowly opening up in the sun. Finotello shows me how to cut a castra\u00f9ra gently off the stalk with the traditional curved knife, which he holsters in the pocket of his overalls between rows. The plants used to be fertilised with scoasse (garbage in Venetian dialect), a mix of fish bones and old crab shells. \"We can't do that anymore because there's too much plastic in the food system,\" Finotello tells me, shrugging. \"We'd just be feeding the plants plastic.\"\nWhen he finishes harvesting the small field, he counts how many castra\u00f9re he picked: 105. He then dumps the basket in the back of his trailer and looks at me, grinning. \"Now you need to eat some.\"\nAt the farmhouse, his mother, Mirella Bubacco, is holding court in a kitchen busy with the detritus of the recent Italian Easter celebration: chocolate eggs and endless cups of espresso next to slices of colomba, a type of Italian Easter cake. Mirella is warm, businesslike \u2013 and very chatty.\n\"Don't ever eat it as an antipasto!\" she warns me, a paring knife in one hand. \"The taste lingers in your mouth, and it'll alter the taste of your first course.\" She insists that it is best eaten in the very simple Venetian style: uncooked, julienned, with a ribbon of light-tasting olive oil, a bit of salt and shavings of Grana Padano. \"The earth here on Sant'Erasmo is all the condiment you need!\"\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. \n\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. \n",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nVitor Pereira - I want to build something stronger with Wolves\nVitor Pereira walks up the stairs of a pub in Shropshire, sits and puts his pint down. \n\"I'm in a good mood today, the weather is good, more beer, please,\" jokes the Wolves head coach, who adds that he enjoys a pint of Stella.\nPereira is holding court at a round table upstairs in a country pub just outside Wolverhampton, five months into his reign at Molineux. \nThis is not some gimmick he has done before at other clubs. The relationship with media in other countries - Pereira has worked in Portugal, Brazil, Greece, Turkey, Saudi and China - is very different. \nBut if interviewing a Premier League manager in a pub sounds both highly unusual and also a throwback to the 1980s, the setting makes more sense given the 56-year-old's habit of celebrating wins by \"being with the people\".\n\"First the points, then the pints\" was a phrase coined by Pereira which has transferred to the stands, with the words now adorning a banner at Molineux. \nIt came as Wolves battled the drop, but a run of six straight wins, their best in the top flight for 55 years, has the club now safely mid-table in the Premier League. \nPereira has endeared himself to Wolves supporters, and the city, with his desire to understand them and the area. \nTrips to the local Wetherspoons near the train station after victories have become a fixture - with Molineux serenading him with 'We'll see you in 'Spoons' during Saturday's 3-0 win over Leicester.\n\"What do we do in Wolverhampton after a game? If I lose the game I stay home and drink my beer alone. If I win the game, I go with the supporters to celebrate,\"  Pereira tells BBC Sport.\n\"The connection with the people is stronger when we suffer together and, when you are in a situation where you are fighting for survival, you feel this connection.\n\"In the moments we are suffering, you feel we are suffering together. In the moments of celebration, you need to be with them.\n\"In Wolverhampton, where do you want me to go? I must go to a pub, because this is the culture and where people go.\n\"When I go to a pub it's not about the beer. Of course I like the beer but I go to be with the people, to feel that I'm doing something to make them happy, to make them proud.\n\"Work, home, then we go to a pub just for a beer or two beers and finish. This is our life.\"\nThis video can not be played\nDo Wolves have money to spend this summer?\nWatch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer\nVisit all of BBC Sport's Wolves content\nThe down-to-earth philosophy comes from Pereira's upbringing.\nGrowing up on the coast in Espinho, 10 miles south of Porto, he recalls the harsh conditions he endured which have shaped him. \n\"It was a very humble village with fishermen and we grew up on the street,\" he said. \n\"Fighting together, fighting for the space. Competing and fighting. But this is what I have inside of me. This is the power.\n\"My house was 50 metres from the beach. At the time my father didn't have money so we lived in a 'basement'.\n\"The sea, in the winter, came strong, without barriers. Every winter, for three months, there was water inside. We had to rebuild the house. Every time there was water in the walls and a bad smell. I felt ashamed because my clothes smelled.\n\"You felt wet every time, that was our life.\n\"[Yet] I was a very happy teenager at the time because in this kind of community we have the confident guys together. When I look back, this power I feel inside of me came from this time.\"\nWolves have adopted Vitor Pereira's phrase after his success at Molineux \nHis playing career, Pereira readily admits, was underwhelming. He played as a midfielder for lesser-known Portuguese clubs Avanca, Oliveirense, Esmoriz, Estarreja, Fiaes and Sao Joao de Ver and retired at 28. \nYet it was enough to help put him through a sports course at the University of Porto, as he finished second in his class while completing his coaching qualifications. \n\"I had a career, it was in the third division in Portugal but I got the money to do my course, to go to the university, to buy my car, to buy my clothes,\" he said. \n\"Since I was 16 years-old, I never asked for one euro from my parents. After 16, small jobs, to get money, to go to the discos.\n\"On Saturdays, I was a lifeguard on the beach. They paid me a lot of money. I saw the sun and I saved people.\n\"I was 18 and 19 at that time - no worries. I went to the university. I did some small jobs to get some money and I started to save. I'm now 56. But my sons will spend the money, don't worry!\"\nHis three sons are all in their 20s and Pereira, who always felt being a coach was his calling, does not want - or expect - them to follow him into football. \n\"The sacrifices you have to make. I don't want this life for my sons,\" he says. \n\"They cannot have a family life in this job. It's impossible. We have a lot of moments where we suffer a lot and alone. I think we are always in a pre-depression.\n\"For me, the competition is like a drug. Passion and a drug. I cannot live without it because after one month I start to be nervous. I cannot enjoy nothing.\"\nPereira met BBC Sport and other journalists in a local pub for an on-record interview\n\"I want to recharge with their energy\" - Pereira celebrates with Wolves fans after beating Manchester United\nIt is clear Pereira misses his family, having travelled the globe since he started managing Padroense juniors in 2003. \nHe eventually became Porto assistant, to Andre Villas-Boas, and was in that role when they won the Europa League in 2011, replacing Villas-Boas when he moved to Chelsea.\nHis first game was against Pep Guardiola's Barcelona in the Super Cup, a 2-0 defeat,  but he won successive Primeira Liga titles before joining Al-Ahli and then Olympiacos, lifting the Greek Super League.\nSpells at 1860 Munich, Shanghai, Fenerbahce, Corinthians, Flamengo and Al Shabab followed before he joined Wolves, yet the intensity of management is not something which bothers him. \nHe said: \"I cannot speak about this because I don't want to cry, I have moments in my life. When I arrived in Brazil, I went to Corinthians. If you see the stadium of Corinthians and Flamengo, they have millions of supporters.\n\"When I met the press they ask me, 'Vitor, you don't feel the pressure?'. I'll tell you about the pressure. The pressure was when my father had cancer, my brother was dying, my mother was crying.\n\"When we deal with this, football is football. I don't feel any pressure, nothing. Zero. believe me.\"\nWolves go to Manchester City on Friday without pressure - after their 1-0 win at Manchester United in April that sealed survival with five games remaining.\nThere will be change in the summer after this season's brush with relegation. Matheus Cunha is expected to leave, with Manchester United interested, and the Brazil forward, who has scored 15 goals, has a \u00a362.5m release clause. \nPereira insists he cannot second-guess what will happen with Cunha, but that he will \"wish him the best\" either way. He says the 25-year-old has not directly told him he wants to leave, but is adamant he needs the power to shape the squad. \nMany will feel he has earned it. \nOnly champions Liverpool and Newcastle have won more games than Pereira's 10 in his 18 matches since he replaced Gary O'Neil in December - while Wolves have won more points than relegated trio of Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton combined in that same period.\nWolves were second bottom and five points adrift of the Foxes when he took over, they are now 23 ahead and 13th. Pereira will not need to buy another drink in Wolverhampton. \n\"Every time, I think I can do better and better and better because I just expressed half of myself,\" he adds. \n\"I have a lot to prove. If I'm in the right place to challenge me, I can do magic. Believe me.\"\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nEx-West Ham boss Lopetegui named Qatar manager",

        "article_text": "Israel says its fighter jets bombed an area next to the presidential palace in Syria's capital Damascus on Friday morning, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to protect the Druze religious minority following days of deadly sectarian violence.\nNetanyahu said the strike was a \"clear message to the Syrian regime\" that Israel would \"not allow the deployment of forces south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community\".\nLater on Friday, the Israeli military confirmed it had launched another wave of air strikes, attacking military targets. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, reported nearly 20, with Syrian state media saying one person had been killed. \nThe Syrian presidency has said it strongly condemns the strikes, calling them a \"dangerous escalation\" intended to destabilise Syria.\nIsrael also carried out strikes south of Damascus on Wednesday during clashes between Druze gunmen, security forces and allied Sunni Islamist fighters.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticised the recent Israeli bombing, calling it a \"violation of Syria's sovereignty\".\nIn a statement delivered by his spokesman, Guterres called for Israel to stop such attacks and to respect Syria's \"unity, its territorial integrity and its independence\".\nA spiritual leader of Syria's Druze, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, condemned the violence on Thursday as an \"unjustifiable genocidal campaign\" against his community and called for intervention by \"international forces to maintain peace\".\nOther Druze religious leaders put out a statement early on Friday confirming what they said was the community's \"commitment to a country that includes all Syrians, a nation that is free of strife\", according to the Associated Press.\nThey also reportedly said the state should be activated in Suweida province, and that authorities should be in control of the Suweida-Damascus highway.\nThe Syrian government said it had deployed security forces to Druze areas to combat \"outlaw groups\" which it accused of instigating the clashes.\nAccording to SOHR, at least 109 people have been killed this week in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya, a town in the southern outskirts of Damascus, the mainly Druze suburb of Jaramana, and the southern province of Suweida, which has a Druze majority.\nIt says that includes 11 Druze civilians and 26 Druze fighters, as well as another 42 Druze men who were shot dead in an \"ambush\" by security forces while travelling from Suweida to Damascus on Wednesday. Thirty members of the General Security service and allied fighters have also been killed, it says.\nIstanbul-based Syria TV reported that the Israeli air strike near the presidential palace appeared to have targeted an empty area, and that there were no reports of casualties or material damage.\nIsrael's Defence Minister issued a statement saying that when the Syrian president woke up and saw the results he would \"understand well that Israel is determined to prevent harm to the Druze in Syria\".\n\"It is [Sharaa's] duty to protect the Druze in the suburbs of Damascus from jihadist assailants and to allow the hundreds of thousands of Druze in Suweida and Jabal al-Druze to defend themselves on their own, rather than sending jihadist forces into their communities,\" he added.\nIn a statement released on Friday afternoon, the Syrian presidency said it \"condemned in the strongest terms the bombing of the presidential palace yesterday by the Israeli occupation, which constitutes a dangerous escalation against state institutions and the sovereignty of the state\".\n\"This reprehensible attack reflects the continuation of reckless movements that seek to destabilize the country and exacerbate security crises,\" it added.\nThe presidency also called on the international community to stand by Syria in confronting the attacks, which it said violated international law.\nA Druze religious leader in Suweida, Sheikh Hamoud al-Hinawi, meanwhile told the BBC that the situation was \"still tense\" in the affected areas.\n\"What is happening right now is sectarian targeting by extremist elements [and] it is the duty of the state to protect civilians,\" he said.\n\"We support the rule of law and national sovereignty of Syria, as long as the national government is protecting its citizens and adhering to its commitment to rebuilding a modern Syria.\"\nWhen asked whether he supported the Israeli intervention, Sheikh Hinawi said: \"It's not a matter of whether I am for or against Israel - it is a matter of life and death for us and if we are being attacked we have every right to defend ourselves.\"\nOn Thursday, a member of the security forces deployed in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya told the BBC that they were \"not targeting any sect, but rather dealing with an armed group acting outside the law, regardless of its religious affiliation\", adding: \"Any such group will be held accountable.\"\nThe sectarian violence erupted in Jaramana on Monday night after an audio clip of a man insulting the Prophet Muhammad circulated on social media and angered Sunni Muslims.

We knew before the game Arsenal had got beat and we knew what we needed, but we wanted to win, we wanted to be unbeaten all season.\n\"Although we have won the league tonight we have two games left and we want to win those too. We want to be unbeaten for the whole season.\"\nThe numbers behind Chelsea's latest WSL title\nOnly in three previous completed seasons has the WSL been won by an unbeaten side - Arsenal in 2012, Manchester City in 2016 and Chelsea themselves in 2018.\nBut it has never been done over the current format of a 22-game season. If Chelsea avoid defeat against Tottenham next Sunday then at home to Liverpool on 10 May, they will have broken new ground.\nBompastor will have to deal with the repercussions of such a disappointing Champions League exit - but registering perhaps the most comprehensive WSL title of all time will go some way to making up for it.\nIndeed, if Chelsea win their final two games, they will set a new WSL points record - beating their own tally of 58 in 2022-23. Victory in their remaining fixtures will make the Blues the first side to record 60 points in a campaign.\nSonia Bompastor has added the WSL title to the three French leagues she won with Lyon\n\"I always look for perfection and the ideal,\" Bompastor told her post-match media conference at Leigh Sports Village.\n\"I told my players out of position and defensively I want to keep a clean sheet. I want to fight for each other. We spoke about how we managed the depth and how we needed to be compact, win the duels and win the second balls. It is all these details. \n\"I am never satisfied. Even when we win I am already focused on the treble and the other finals.\"\nBompastor has become the first manager to lead a side to the WSL title in their maiden season since Laura Harvey took Arsenal to the top of the inaugural league in 2011.\nShe admitted she had worried about the pressure when she made her much-vaunted move from Lyon to London, and filling the shoes of predecessor Emma Hayes, who she praised fulsomely after beating Man Utd.\nThis video can not be played\nBompastor - proud of WSL title winners Chelsea\n\"When you come to Chelsea everyone expects you to win the league,\" she said. \"It was the same in Lyon but here the competition is higher. To be able to achieve it for six years in a row for Chelsea and in my first season, it is not easy. \n\"I heard some noise about the fact it is too easy for Chelsea but it is not! When you are able to be unbeaten, to beat Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United twice, I don't know how people can think that. It is unbelievable.\n\"Don't think it's easy. It's never easy. It's a great achievement and a lot of work every day. I don't let my players breathe.\n\"I want to thank Emma [Hayes]. I am sure she is really happy tonight with our title. She left the club in a great place to build on the legacy.\"\nChelsea have not always blown sides away this campaign - they have scored fewer goals than second-placed Arsenal, while no player has netted double figures in the league.\nWednesday night encapsulated their league campaign. United had more shots, a higher xG, and a very solid shout for a penalty before half-time when Millie Bright appeared to trip Grace Clinton. Chelsea keeper Hannah Hampton made five saves and was named player of the match.\nBut they find a way to win, and win, and win. And crucially, not lose.\n\"Coming to this club I always wanted to achieve trophies,\" Hampton told the BBC. \"The fact that I can say that in the two seasons I have been here we have won the title both times it is surreal. It never gets old. As many times as we win it, it'll never get old.\"\nChelsea's season now has three games to run - the two league fixtures, then the FA Cup final against Manchester United, again, on 18 May.\nTo end it unbeaten domestically would be a remarkable achievement.\n\"It's what dreams are made of for Sonia Bompastor,\" former England defender Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports. \"Her staff, the new players and the existing players that have done this before.

If Chelsea avoid defeat against Tottenham next Sunday then at home to Liverpool on 10 May, they will have broken new ground.\nBompastor will have to deal with the repercussions of such a disappointing Champions League exit - but registering perhaps the most comprehensive WSL title of all time will go some way to making up for it.\nIndeed, if Chelsea win their final two games, they will set a new WSL points record - beating their own tally of 58 in 2022-23. Victory in their remaining fixtures will make the Blues the first side to record 60 points in a campaign.\nSonia Bompastor has added the WSL title to the three French leagues she won with Lyon\n\"I always look for perfection and the ideal,\" Bompastor told her post-match media conference at Leigh Sports Village.\n\"I told my players out of position and defensively I want to keep a clean sheet. I want to fight for each other. We spoke about how we managed the depth and how we needed to be compact, win the duels and win the second balls. It is all these details. \n\"I am never satisfied. Even when we win I am already focused on the treble and the other finals.\"\nBompastor has become the first manager to lead a side to the WSL title in their maiden season since Laura Harvey took Arsenal to the top of the inaugural league in 2011.\nShe admitted she had worried about the pressure when she made her much-vaunted move from Lyon to London, and filling the shoes of predecessor Emma Hayes, who she praised fulsomely after beating Man Utd.\nThis video can not be played\nBompastor - proud of WSL title winners Chelsea\n\"When you come to Chelsea everyone expects you to win the league,\" she said. \"It was the same in Lyon but here the competition is higher. To be able to achieve it for six years in a row for Chelsea and in my first season, it is not easy. \n\"I heard some noise about the fact it is too easy for Chelsea but it is not! When you are able to be unbeaten, to beat Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United twice, I don't know how people can think that. It is unbelievable.\n\"Don't think it's easy. It's never easy. It's a great achievement and a lot of work every day. I don't let my players breathe.\n\"I want to thank Emma [Hayes]. I am sure she is really happy tonight with our title. She left the club in a great place to build on the legacy.\"\nChelsea have not always blown sides away this campaign - they have scored fewer goals than second-placed Arsenal, while no player has netted double figures in the league.\nWednesday night encapsulated their league campaign. United had more shots, a higher xG, and a very solid shout for a penalty before half-time when Millie Bright appeared to trip Grace Clinton. Chelsea keeper Hannah Hampton made five saves and was named player of the match.\nBut they find a way to win, and win, and win. And crucially, not lose.\n\"Coming to this club I always wanted to achieve trophies,\" Hampton told the BBC. \"The fact that I can say that in the two seasons I have been here we have won the title both times it is surreal. It never gets old. As many times as we win it, it'll never get old.\"\nChelsea's season now has three games to run - the two league fixtures, then the FA Cup final against Manchester United, again, on 18 May.\nTo end it unbeaten domestically would be a remarkable achievement.\n\"It's what dreams are made of for Sonia Bompastor,\" former England defender Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports. \"Her staff, the new players and the existing players that have done this before. They know what it feels like. They don't care where they do it or how they do it as long as they do it.\"\nHead here to get involved\nGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

        "article_text": "\"We don't care about sales to the United States,\" says Hu Tianqiang as one of his toy fighter jets flies past our heads.\nIt's hard to hear him above the buzzing toy planes and miniature drones, an almost rhythmic backdrop to the cacophony of toys that surround him, all clamouring for the attention of buyers.\nHu's stall, Zhongxiang Toys, sits inside the world's biggest wholesale market in the small Chinese city of Yiwu.\nIt's a huge showroom of more than 75,000 shops where buyers come seeking just about everything, from twinkling Christmas lights and kitchenware to umbrellas and massage guns. It can take most of the day just to get around one department given each of them has an airport hangar's worth of goods on show.\nYiwu is in the province of Zhejiang, along China's eastern coast. The manufacturing and export hub, home to more than 30 ports, accounted for 17% of all Chinese sales to the US last year.\nThat puts Yiwu, and this region, at the frontline of the US-China trade war.\nMr Hu, too, is on the frontline. He sits among rows of snazzy toy jets, squeaking dogs, fluffy stuffed animals, barbies and motorcycle-riding spidermen \u2013 a sliver of the $34bn (\u00a325bn) worth of toys China exported in 2024.\nAbout $10bn of it went to the US. But now, these Chinese exports to America face up to 245% tariffs. And US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he blames Beijing in particular for cornering too much of the global market.\nBut things have changed here since Trump's first trade war against China, which kicked off in 2018. It taught Yiwu a lesson, summed up by Mr Hu: \"Other countries have money too!\"\nThat defiance has become a familiar theme in the world's second-biggest economy, which is bracing itself for another turbulent Trump presidency.\nBeijing, which has been repeatedly telling the world that the US was bullying countries into trade negotiations, has not backed down yet from the trade war.\nThe propaganda online has ratcheted up, applauding Chinese innovation and diplomacy in contrast to the uncertainty unleashed by Trump. On the country's highly controlled social media, there are plenty of posts echoing the leadership's promise that China will keep fighting.\nAnd in factories and markets, businessmen and exporters now say they have other alternatives, beyond Trump's America. Mr Hu, for instance, says around 20%-30% of his business came from US buyers. But not anymore.\n\"We don't care about that 20-30%,\" Mr Hu says. \"We now sell mostly to South America and the Middle East. We are not lacking money, we are rich.\"\nWhen we ask about Trump, his colleague Chen Lang jumps in, rolling his eyes: \"He's cracking international jokes like no other. One day, one joke. Adding tariffs for him is like cracking a joke.\"\nNearby, one of the thousands of buyers that flock to this market every day is negotiating a price to buy more than 100 robots that turn into cars in a series of beeps and buzzes. After tapping various numbers into a calculator, the final price is written in chalk on the floor.\nThe buyer, we are told, is from Dubai. The BBC met many others from across Africa and South America.\nLin Xiupeng says he has noticed the shift away from American buyers in his last 10 years in the toy business.\n\"A few days ago, the shop next to us had an order from a US client. It's worth more than one million yuan. But because of tariffs, the shop owner decided to cancel it,\" he says, offering us cups of tea.\n\"They must need China,\" he says, adding that the country supplies most of America's toys.\n\"I think there are a lot of businesses in the US protesting these days.\"\nMr Lin is correct. Some toy shop owners in the US have written to the White House describing the tariffs as \"disastrous\" for their business.\n\"The tariffs are taking a hatchet to small businesses across America,\" Jonathan Cathey, who owns a toy company in Los Angeles, told the BBC over the phone.\nHe invested his last $500 in his company, Loyal Subjects, in 2009, which he ran from his two-bedroom bungalow in West Hollywood. He says it's now a multi-million-dollar business, but the tariffs could derail his plans.\n\"The entire toy industry could go under. We are looking at the total implosion of the supply chain. It's going to get really ugly,\" he warns.\nHe says swapping suppliers is a huge task: \"You need a lot of resources on the ground to produce a toy and many of these Chinese businesses have spent 40 years perfecting their craft.\"\nChina has been a big part of Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, with his administration going head-to-head with Beijing.\n\"He seems to be launching a crusade against the whole world,\" says former Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, who served in the People's Liberation Army. \"But of course he's trying to bash China the hardest.\"\nTrump accused China of operating the Panama Canal, which is run by a Hong Kong-based firm, and vowed to take it back. He has been on the hunt for ways to mine rare earth minerals, which China effectively has a monopoly over, making this a key part of any deal with Ukraine. His threats to take Greenland are also likely aimed at curbing China's ambitions in the Arctic. \nAnd, of course, he initiated another trade war, which takes special aim at China's neighbours, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, that have been crucial to its evolving supply chain.\nIn the last week, he suggested the levies on Chinese goods could be halved and spoke of \"a fair deal with China\" that his administration was \"actively\" negotiating.\nBut China's Commerce Ministry rebuffed this as \"groundless with no factual basis\". The headlines in state media haven't spared him either:  \"Trump is probably the worst president in American history,\" read one on state TV.\nIt seems the US president is waiting for his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to pick up the phone.\n\"We in China say \u2013 we have to let the bullet fly for a moment,\" Col Zhou says. \"That means in the fog of war, we do not know what will come next. I believe this kind of tit-for-tat would last for maybe one or two months \u2013 hopefully not more than three months.\"\nIt cannot go on, he adds, because that would not be good.\nIt's certainly not good for China. Trump's tariffs are not even the biggest challenge facing the country, which is also grappling with domestic economic pain, from low consumption to a housing crisis that has dented people's savings and confidence in the future.\nThe terrible timing aside, the tariffs are biting Chinese businesses.\nGoldman Sachs has forecast that China's economy will grow by 4.5% this year, short of the government's target: 5%.\nThe BBC reported from the trading hub of Guangzhou in mid-April that US-China trade was grinding to a halt, with exports to American households piling up on factory floors. That is borne out by this month's economic data, which show that activity in factories has sharply slowed.\nWhen the BBC rang suppliers to see if shipments to the US had resumed, what emerged was a messy picture. One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted.\nThe range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs.\nWhatever the business, there is no doubt the American consumer will feel the absence, or potentially higher prices, of Chinese goods.\nThe US still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing to meet its own domestic demand \u2013 think phones, computers, semiconductors, furniture, clothes and, of course, toys. Electronics and machinery alone account for more than 50% of US imports.\nWalmart and Target reportedly told Mr Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could carry on until Christmas.\nSome 90% of all Christmas decorations hung around American homes come from Yiwu in China, where sellers, surrounded by signs wishing the world \"Feliz Navidad\" told us they're now trying to focus on sales to South America.\nAnd that effort is very evident in Yiwu.\nIn the early morning, before the shutters even open, the cavernous lobby of the wholesale market echoes with voices reciting key phrases.\n\"Shukran,\" says the teacher in Arabic. The students repeat it several times to perfect the pronunciation before learning that it means \"thank you\". \"Aafwan\" comes the reply, or \"you're welcome\".\nThese are free lessons offered by a local government association. Most of the students are women, dressed in their best to also impress their customers.\n\"These women are the backbone of trade across China,\" says one stall holder, who is originally from Iran and is giving private lessons to an eager student.\n\"They're doing these lessons to stay ahead of one another, to stay in competition.\"\nMost of the traders can already speak a few words of English. Now they say they need to greet their new buyers in Spanish and Arabic \u2013 a small but crucial sign of China's shifting trade relationships.\nOscar, a Colombian who would only give us his first name, was wandering the halls of the market with bags filled with fluffy bunnies and bears.\nHe says the US-China trade war offers \"many opportunities\" for traders from other parts of the world.\n\"Doing business with China is very important,\" he insists. \"[Doing business with] the US these days, less so.\"",

        "article_text": "Last week's deadly militant attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed 26 civilian lives, has reignited a grim sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for India's security forces and diplomats.\nThis is familiar ground. In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the Line of Control \u2013 the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.\nIn 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.\nAnd before that, the horrific 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives.\nEach time, India has held Pakistan-based militant groups responsible for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.\nSince 2016, and especially after the 2019 airstrikes, the threshold for escalation has shifted dramatically. Cross-border and aerial strikes by India have become the new norm, provoking retaliation from Pakistan. This has further intensified an already volatile situation.\nOnce again, experts say, India finds itself walking the tightrope between escalation and restraint - a fragile balance of response and deterrence. One person who understands this recurring cycle is Ajay Bisaria, India's former high commissioner to Pakistan during the Pulwama attack, who captured its aftermath in his memoir, Anger Management: The Troubled Diplomatic Relationship between India and Pakistan.\n\"There are striking parallels between the aftermath of the Pulwama bombing and the killings in Pahalgam,\" Mr Bisaria told me on Thursday, 10 days after the latest attack.\nYet, he notes, Pahalgam marks a shift. Unlike Pulwama and Uri, which targeted security forces, this attack struck civilians - tourists from across India - evoking memories of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. \"This attack carries elements of Pulwama, but much more of Mumbai,\" he explains.\n\"We're once again in a conflict situation, and the story is unfolding in much the same way,\" Mr Bisaria says.\nA week after the latest attack, Delhi moved quickly with retaliatory measures: closing the main border crossing, suspending a key water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals - who were given days to leave. Troops on both sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border in recent days.\nDelhi also barred all Pakistani aircraft - commercial and military - from its airspace, mirroring Islamabad's earlier move. Pakistan retaliated with its own visa suspensions and suspended a 1972 peace treaty with India. (Kashmir, claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but administered in parts by each, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations since their partition in 1947.)\n\nIn his memoir, Mr Bisaria recounts India's response after the Pulwama attack on 14 February 2019. \nHe was summoned to Delhi the morning after, as the government moved quickly to halt trade - revoking Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, granted in 1996. In the following days, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) imposed a 200% customs duty on Pakistani goods, effectively ending imports, and suspended trade at the land border at  Wagah.\nMr Bisaria notes that a broader set of measures was also proposed to scale down engagement with Pakistan, most of which were subsequently implemented.\nThey included suspending a cross-border train known as the Samjhauta Express, and a bus service linking Delhi and Lahore; deferring talks between border guards on both sides and negotiations over the historic Kartarpur corridor to one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, halting visa issuance, ceasing cross border, banning Indian travel to Pakistan, and suspending flights between the two countries.\n\"How hard it was to build trust, I thought. And how easy was it to break it,\" Mr Bisaria writes.\n\"All the confidence-building measures planned, negotiated, and implemented over years in this difficult relationship, could be slashed off on a yellow notepad in minutes.\"\nThe strength of the Indian high commission in Islamabad was reduced from 110 to 55 only in June 2020 after a separate diplomatic incident. (It now stands at 30 after the Pahalgam attack.) India also launched a diplomatic offensive. \nA day after the attack, then foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale briefed envoys from 25 countries - including the US, UK, China, Russia, and France - on the role of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Pakistan-based militant group behind the bombing, and accused Pakistan of using terrorism as state policy. JeM, designated a terrorist organisation by India, the UN, the UK, and the US, had claimed responsibility for the bombing. \nIndia's diplomatic offensive continued on 25 February, 10 days after the attack, pushing for JeM chief Masood Azhar's designation as a terrorist by the UN sanctions committee and inclusion on the EU's \"autonomous terror list\".\nWhile there was pressure to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty - a key river water sharing agreement - India opted instead to withhold any data beyond treaty obligations, Mr Bisaria writes. A total of 48 bilateral agreements were reviewed for possible suspension. An all-party meeting was convened in Delhi, resulting in a unanimous resolution. \nAt the same time, communication channels remained open - including the hotline between the two countries' Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO), a key link for military-to-military contact, as well as both high commissions. In 2019, as now, Pakistan said the attack was a \"false-flag operation\".\nMuch like this time a crackdown in Kashmir saw the arrest of over 80 \"overground workers\" - local supporters who may have provided logistical help, shelter, and intelligence to militants from the Pakistan-based group. Rajnath Singh, then Indian home minister, visited Jammu and Kashmir, and dossiers on the attack and suspected perpetrators were prepared.\nIn a meeting with the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Mr Bisaria told her that \"that India's diplomatic options in dealing with a terrorist attack of this nature was limited\".\n\"She gave me the impression that some tough action was round the corner, after which, I should expect the role of diplomacy to expand,\" Mr Bisaria writes. \nOn 26 February, Indian airstrikes - its first across the international border since 1971 - targeted JeM's training camp in Balakot.\nSix hours later, the Indian foreign secretary announced the strikes had killed \"a very large number\" of militants and commanders. Pakistan swiftly denied the claim. More high-level meetings followed in Delhi.\nThe crisis escalated dramatically the next morning, 27 February, when Pakistan launched retaliatory air raids.\nIn the ensuing dogfight, an Indian fighter jet was shot down, and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, ejected and landed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Captured by Pakistani forces, his detention in enemy territory triggered a wave of national concern and further heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.\nMr Bisaria writes India activated multiple diplomatic channels, with US and UK envoys pressing Islamabad. The Indian message was \"any attempt by Pakistan to escalate situation further or to cause harm to the pilot would lead to escalation by India.\"\nPakistani prime minister Imran Khan announced the pilot's release on 28 February, with the handover occurring on 1 March under prisoner of war protocol. Pakistan presented the move as a \"goodwill gesture\" aimed at de-escalating tensions.\nBy 5 March, with the dust settling from Pulwama, Balakot, and the pilot's return, India's political temperature had cooled. The Cabinet Committee on Security decided to send India's high commissioner back to Pakistan, signalling a shift towards diplomacy.\n\"I arrived in Islamabad on 10 March, 22 days after leaving in the wake of Pulwama. The most serious military exchange since Kargil had run its course in less than a month,\" Mr Bisaria writes,\n\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience.\"\nMr Bisaria described it as a \"testing and fascinating time\" to be a diplomat. This time, he notes, the key difference is that the targets were Indian civilians, and the attack occurred \"ironically, when the situation in Kashmir had dramatically improved\".\nHe views escalation as inevitable, but notes there's also a \"de-escalation instinct alongside the escalation instinct\". When the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meets during such conflicts, he says, their decisions weigh the conflict's economic impact and seek measures that hurt Pakistan without triggering a backlash against India.\n\"The body language and optics are similar [this time],\" he says, but highlights what he sees as the most significant move: India's threat to annul the Indus Waters Treaty. \"If India acts on this, it would have long-term, serious consequences for Pakistan.\"\n\"Remember, we're still in the middle of a crisis,\" says Mr Bisaria. \"We haven't yet seen any kinetic [military] action.\"",

        "article_text": "The trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of the most successful rappers and music moguls in the US, starts in New York on 5 May with jury selection. \nThe charges against him include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\nThe rapper also faces dozens of lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.\nMr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".\nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.\nHis early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G.\nHis music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\nMr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand, C\u00eeroc.\nIn 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.\nIn a federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.  \nMany of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.\nIt includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack. \nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. \nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, dozens of people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. \nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nIn a hearing in New York a week before the trial, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the \"lifestyle\" of a \"swinger\" and was not a criminal. \nThey said he thought it was \"appropriate\" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers. \nAt the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal. \nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail\u2019s \u201chorrific\u201d conditions. \nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. \nA New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a \u201cserious flight risk\u201d.\nProsecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses. \nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nThe trial is scheduled to begin on 5 May.\nThe first days of the trial will be for jury selection, with the trial starting in earnest after the panel is selected. \nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public.\nAll of his court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but have not been livestreamed.\nMost federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom.\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.\nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.\nTransportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.",

        "article_text": "When Alberto Salagan was deported from the US in January it was the first time he'd stepped foot in Mexico since he was a baby.\nBorn in the coastal resort of Acapulco, his parents took him to the US when he was just six months old.\nGrowing up in California, he was seduced by the false glamour of gang life.\nAfter his arrest in San Diego for gang activity, Alberto was sent back to Mexico just as President Trump was taking office, and found himself homeless and alone in the country of his birth.\n\"It was a shock. It still is,\" he admits. \"When I got here to Mexico, I really felt lost. No family, no food, no clothes, no nothing.\"\n\nAlberto says he'd almost forgotten how to speak and read Spanish. \"Good thing I didn't lose it completely because it's helped me [to be bilingual],\" he reflects.\nIn fact, his language skills saved the 30-year-old from becoming destitute. Through a deportee support organisation, he heard that a local company \u2013 EZ Call Center \u2013 was looking for English-speakers.\nThe work, as telephone sales agents, isn't well paid, but employees can earn commissions, and the regular pay cheque gave Alberto the stability he craved.\n\"I had to do something to get back on my feet. Thanks to the call centre, now I have,\" he tells me during a break between calls.\nAlmost every agent at EZ Call Center is a deportee, including the company's owner, Daniel Ruiz.\nHe was also born in Mexico and grew up in the US before being deported for low-level drug crime in his early 20s. Daniel says he can relate to his employees' initial sense of disorientation in Mexico.\n\"We are all dealing with culture shock,\" he says over a steady hum of telephone calls.\n\"We all have our life over there, went to school over there, were brought up on American culture, have family over there. We're from here but we're from over there too.\"\nIn their booths, the agents work through long lists of US phone numbers, some making promotional calls or sales, others calling about debt collection and refinancing.\nAll the agents speak fluent English, and the clients at the other end of the line are none the wiser that they're talking to people in Mexico rather than the US.\nDaniel says that agents like Alberto \u2013 who fell into gangs and crime at a vulnerable age in the US, but are willing to turn over a new leaf in Mexico \u2013 are among his most trusted employees.\n\"They almost never have another mark on their criminal record, and they possess the right discipline to hold down their jobs,\" he explains.\nDaniel Ruiz's own experiences after deportation have informed his business decisions.\nAs well as the telesales company, he also co-founded a humanitarian organisation \u2013 called the Borderline Crisis Center \u2013 which provides deportees with food, shelter and support on their arrival back in Mexico.\nAfter his inauguration, President Trump said he would carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation in American history\".\nHe has spoken of the removal of millions of undocumented people from US soil, and in the early days of his presidency Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents made workplace raids from Chicago to California.\nMexican humanitarian organisations, including the Borderline Crisis Center, braced themselves for a huge influx of returnees.\nSo far, though, one hasn't materialised. There are no major bottlenecks of migrants at the border, and the migrant shelters in Tijuana are not currently overflowing. \nThe latest figures from the Mexican government actually show that the number of deportations from the US to Mexico were lower during the first three months of Trump's second administration than they were for the same period last year. \nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico received almost 39,000 deportees in February to April, of which 33,000 were Mexican. This compares with 52,000 for the same three months in 2024.\nHowever, the fall was in part due to a reduction in the number of people trying to get into the US in the first place. Migrant \"encounters\" on the US southern border by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents has dropped to their lowest level in years.\nThe threat of mass deportation combined with other factors \u2013 from military deployments at the border, to the high-profile deportations of migrants to El Salvador \u2013 may have acted as an effective deterrent.\nThe Trump Administration is also pushing the idea of self-deportation hard to undocumented immigrants through blunt warnings.\nStill, there are people being sent back to Tijuana on a near daily basis. Many face hostility as they try to resettle in the dusty and dangerous border city.\nThe few companies which offer deportees gainful employment have become even more important to avoid a slide into criminality.\nBeyond a smaller venture like EZ Call Center, a larger company called the American Survey Company or ASC also relies on a deportee workforce. \nWith its sister company, Voxcentrix, ASC has some 550 call centre stations in Tijuana, where agents make calls on everything from election polling to customer satisfaction surveys.\n\"What happened in the US stays in the US,\" laughs Nora Diaz, ASC's chief happiness officer. \"We don't really do background checks on that.\"\nNora says her job is focussed on the employees' wellbeing, to help them reintegrate.\n\"We understand everyone has a past, and we don't judge based on that. We don't ask about it during our interview process. We just need people who speak good English and good Spanish and are willing to commit to a job,\" she explains.\nThe \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy at ASC was invaluable to Luis Luna's new start.\nHe grew up in Orange Country in California having been taken to the US when he was just a few months old.\n\"Unfortunately, as a kid, I made some bad choices: joined a gang, ran around with the wrong crowd. Cost me a lot, cost me a life sentence.

On release, he was also sent back to Mexico in January, just as Trump was gearing up for his inaugural speech.\nNow 50-years-old and covered in gang-related tattoos, Luis knew he wouldn't get many more second chances in life.\n\"I got no family over here. My family is ASC, the people I met in my employment, they're my family and my friends.\"\nFor Luis, the outwardly dull telephony work has provided the anchor he needs to stay out of crime, something he says ex-gang members he knows in the US struggle with.\n\"From the first day I didn't feel any judgement at all. I felt they just opened their arms and took me in. I think I'd be in the streets right now if it wasn't for ASC,\" he adds.\nWhile the Trump Administration's mass deportation programme isn't yet at a level many in Mexico expected, some believe it could pick up pace over the coming months.\nIf so, deportees with gang pasts like Alberto and Luis will need some help to start again, irrespective of their crimes.\nIn Tijuana, many of them will find it at the end of a telephone line.",

Where's Ipswich?\"\nThe gig included hit songs like Californication that was described as \"immense\", and others like Can't Stop, Dani California and Right on Time with a London Calling style intro. \nBBC reporter Jim Connolly said at the time the crowd \"lapped up\" the performance. \nIn late 2009 P!nk announced her Funhouse Summer Carnival Tour for the UK which included a Portman Road date.\nIt was just one of six shows for the American singer.\nIn the summer of the following year, P!nk delighted fans with songs including Get the Party Started, Funhouse and So What.\nShe also included acrobatic stunts that she has become famous for during her live shows. \nBarry Manilow, the American singer behind Copacabana, Mandy and Could It Be Magic announced he was playing Portman Road in 2014 as part of an eight-date tour. \nIt was also the first show at the stadium since P!nk in 2010. \nManilow performed many of his hits delighting thousands of fans.\nWhile Sheeran has just announced his upcoming shows, it is technically not the first time he has performed at Portman Road. \nSheeran previously performed there in 2021 as part of TikTok's UEFA Euro 2020 show.\nWhile the event was live streamed, there was no live audience however. \nSheeran has performed other shows however across Ipswich including in Chantry Park in 2019.\nTickets for Sheeran's upcoming July shows go on sale in the coming days.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

Local pastor Ian Wilkinson survived after weeks of treatment in hospital.\nThe jury has been shown text messages exchanged between Simon and Erin Patterson the day before the deadly mushroom lunch.\nMr Patterson said in court Thursday he felt \"too uncomfortable\" about attending the lunch.\nErin Patterson responded: \"That's really disappointing. I've spent many hours this week preparing lunch for tomorrow... It's important to me that you're all there tomorrow and that I can have the conversations that I need to have.\"\nThe prosecution alleges Ms Patterson invited the group to lunch \"on the pretence she'd been diagnosed with cancer\".\nThe court in Morwell, regional Victoria, heard that between the couple's marriage in 2007 and separation in 2015, there were a number of periods of separation and reconciliation - including Erin Patterson leaving her husband and their baby son in the middle of a road trip across Australia in 2009.\nMr Patterson had to drive from Townsville to Perth - a distance of about 5,000 km (3,100 miles) - alone with the child, he told the court.\nThe couple met in 2002, while both working at Monash City Council, where Mr Patterson was a civil engineer.\nAsked about his wife, Mr Patterson said: \"Erin is very intelligent.\n\"Some of the things that attracted me to her in the first place is definitely her intelligence. She's quite witty and can be quite funny.\"\nAsked about how his wife got on with his parents, Don and Gail Patterson, Mr Patterson said: \"She especially got on with dad. They shared a love of knowledge and learning in the world.\"\nWith his voice faltering, Mr Patterson added: \"I think she loved his gentle nature.\"\nHe said Ms Patterson held a university degree in business and accounting, and was also qualified as an air traffic controller having worked at Melbourne's Tullemarine airport.\nMr Patterson is due in court again on Friday to take more questions from prosecutors.\nMr Patterson painted a picture of a relationship peppered with periods of separation - the first within the first two years of marriage - at one point becoming emotional and asking for tissues.\nAfter the final separation there was a lot of communication by text message he said, including \"banter\" and talk about politics, he said.\nBut there was a change in the relationship in 2022 when Ms Patterson was \"upset\" when her husband listed himself as separated on his tax return.\nThe \"chatty nature\" of their relationship \"pretty much stopped\" after this, Mr Patterson said - with communication now only about the \"practical management\" of their family life.\nWearing a navy suit, white shirt and purple tie, he told the court that Ms Patterson received a \"substantial inheritance\" from her grandmother which Mr Patterson estimated at A$2m ($1.3m; \u00a3964,000) - though it was not paid in a lump sum and was \"dribbled out\" by the executors of the estate.\nThe jury has heard that there is no dispute that the lunch of beef wellington, mashed potatoes and green beans contained death cap mushrooms and caused the guests' illnesses.\nWhether Ms Patterson intended to kill or cause very serious injury is the main issue in the case, the judge has told the jury.\n\nThe court heard the couple had married in 2007 and had two children together - though separated permanently in 2015 .\nThey had remained \"amicable\" including sharing family holidays, though there was a falling out over child support payments in 2022, the jury was told.\nDuring the prosecution's opening statement on Wednesday, lead barrister Nanette Rogers said the jury would hear evidence that Ms Patterson had travelled to a location, near her home in Leongatha, where death cap mushroom sightings had been logged on a naturalist website.\nAnd in the days after the lunch, she took a number of steps to \"conceal\" what she had done, the prosecution alleged.\nThere'd be evidence that she lied to investigators about the source of the mushrooms in the dish - saying some had come from an Asian grocery in Melbourne and she had never foraged wild ones. And she made a trip to a local dump to dispose of a food dehydrator prosecutors say she used to prepare the toxic meal.\nMs Patterson's barrister has said she did not deliberately serve poisoned food to her guests.\n\"The defence case is that she panicked because she was overwhelmed by the fact that these four people had become so ill because of the food she had served them.\"\nThe court heard how Mr Patterson spoke to his father the morning after the lunch and discovered both his parents had been up since midnight with vomiting and diahorrea and that they had called an ambulance.\nAnd after trying to call his aunt and uncle, Heather and Ian Wilkinson, he went to their home when they did not answer.\n\"Ian answered the door. He looked grey and spooked,\" Mr Patterson recalled. \"Yeah, he was struggling.\n\"I said 'How are you?' He said 'Not good'.\"\nMr Patterson then saw Heather Wilkinson sitting on the couch, he told the court.\n\"She looked pretty crook. She had a container as a spew bucket, \" he said.\nAfter Mr Wilkinson left the room, Heather spoke to him, he confirmed, under questioning from prosecutor Dr Rogers.\n\"We didn't have much conversation, but she was puzzled and she said 'I noticed Erin served herself her food on a coloured plate which was different to the rest'.\"\n\"I acknowledged I'd heard her, but did not progress it as a conversation,\" he added.\nBecause he had been told an ambulance would have taken an hour to arrive, Mr Patterson drove the couple to hospital in the Wilkinsons' car when Heather Wilkinson raised the subject once more.\n\"She mentioned the coloured plate again, She asked me 'Is Erin short of crockery? Is that why she would have this different coloured plate that she served herself with?\" Mr Patterson said.\n\"I can't remember the exact phrase but it was something like that.\nAnd what did you reply, the prosecutor asked?\n\"I said yes, Erin doesn't have that many plates and that may be the reason.\"\nMr Patterson became emotional again, describing going to see his parents at Korumburra hospital where they were in the same room but separate beds.\n\"Dad was substantially worse than mum. He was really struggling,\" he said fighting back tears..\n\"He was lying on his side. He was hunched quite noticeably, with a really discoloured face, struggling to speak.\n\"Speaking was an effort, taking the energy to speak was an effort and his voice was strained in a way that he wasn't right inside. He was in pain.\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

        "article_text": "A few miles from East London's perennially hip neighbourhoods, an explosion of art and culture is transforming a once-neglected stretch into one of the city's hottest destinations.\nEast London. Two words that, if you know anything about the UK's capital, often conjure up opposing opinions.\nThere are those who mourn its supposedly waning hip factor \u2013 regaling stories of 1980s warehouse art shows or squat parties \u2013 while deploring the rampant commercialism of its supercharged epicentre, Shoreditch. Others, meanwhile, will rave about new independent galleries or small-plate restaurants in nearby Dalston, Bethnal Green or Hackney. Yet, the general consensus is that East London's long-buzzing arts and food scenes are continuing to move ever further out, driven \u2013 as in other world cities \u2013 by the relentless search for affordability.\nBut a few miles east of these oversubscribed neighbourhoods are two boroughs that are lesser known to visitors and have been quietly emerging as London's next artsy enclave: Waltham Forest and Newham. Stretching north from Stratford up to Leyton and Walthamstow, this\u00a0 once-unfashionable outer area hasn't always matched East London's brand of cool. And yet in spring 2025, it's witnessing a cultural explosion, with new museums, theatres and bars and some of the city's biggest arts openings that are putting this under-the-radar corner of London on the map.\nThe catalyst for these boroughs' rise was the 2012 London Olympics, which transformed the area's scrapyards and brownfield land into the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park \u2013 an oasis of rivers, canals and water meadows bordered by Stratford, Leyton and Hackney.\n\"The Olympics brought a huge amount of investment in infrastructure, transport links and housing,\" said Britannia Morton, co-chief executive of Sadler's Wells, the world-famous Islington-based dance theatre founded in the 18th Century. \"The Olympic Park, where our new Sadler's Wells East is based, was created converting marshland into this beautiful environment.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSadler's Wells East, which opened in February 2025, is located in East Bank, a \u00a31.1bn new waterside cultural quarter in the Olympic Park. \"[It was] formerly known as Fridge Mountain \u2013 a dumping ground for old electronic appliances,\" said Morton. The first landmark to open here was the University of the Arts' London College of Fashion in October 2023, which has galleries and a cafe open to the public. Sadler's Wells East was built in Italian red brick and houses a 550-seat state-of-the-art auditorium and six dance studios.\n\"Whether you're interested in ballet, hip-hop, kathak or contemporary, our eclectic programme brings the most innovative work created locally, nationally and internationally to Stratford,\" said Morton. Visitors can enjoy free events in its public spaces, including lunchtime dance classes on the community dance floor, as well as a bar and restaurant. There are panoramic views from its rooftop over the London Aquatics Centre, Sir Anish Kapoor's 114.5m ArcelorMittal Orbit (the UK's largest sculpture) and the London Stadium.\nAcross the park at the Here East innovation and tech campus (formerly the London Olympics Media Centre) is the glass-fronted V&A East Storehouse, opening 31 May 2025. It's the first half of the new V&A East, whose South Kensington-based original is the world's largest museum of applied arts, decorative arts and design, with more than 2.8 million objects in its permanent collection.\nThis first instalment is essentially a new home for the V&A East's reserve collection (hence the name \"Storehouse\"), and \"a magical new behind-the-scenes museum experience\", according to its deputy director and COO Tim Reeve. With 100 curated mini displays, its half a million works range from the\u00a0Glastonbury Festival\u00a0Archive to Dior\u00a0haute couture and mid-century furniture. Its\u00a0world-first Order an Object experience allows anyone to book an appointment to view anything from Roman frescoes to Elton John's costumes. It will also be home to the\u00a0new David Bowie Centre, opening 13 September 2025, displaying the singer's outfits, lyrics and archive.\n\"It's a new standard for access to national collections,\" said Reeve. \"We're encouraging visitors to feel empowered to make their own journeys through the V&A's global collections.\"\nThe second half, the five-storey V&A East Museum, is opening in East Bank in spring 2026. Its main exhibition hall will celebrate leading artists, designers and performers in major shows, and its galleries will narrate stories of East London's creative and manufacturing heritage.\nElsewhere in East Bank, BBC Music Studios, which will house the BBC Symphony Orchestra and host recording sessions and live performances, is slated to open in late 2025 or early 2026.\nAnd that's not all. A couple of miles north in Walthamstow, another major cultural opening is happening. While this diverse north-east London suburb has long been thriving \u2013 its pretty village centre, some of which dates to the 15th Century, is indeed a gentrification hotspot \u2013 the imposing new Soho Theatre Walthamstow will further raise the neighbourhood's profile when it opens on 2 May 2025. A former cinema designed in 1930 by architect Cecil Masey, the distinctive building was inspired by the Moorish architecture of the 13th-Century Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. In its mid-20th-Century heyday, it also hosted gigs by The Beatles, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Dusty Springfield, Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones \u2013 before closing in 2003.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 London Overground: Four stops to explore the 'real' London\n\u2022 Five unusual historical experiences in London\n\u2022 See another side to London at eight of its most unusual tourist attractions\nWhen it finally reopens, with its original Art Deco stylings revived, the Soho Theatre Walthamstow will have a 960-seat Grade II-listed auditorium, studio spaces, four bars and a restaurant. (In comparison, its current West End location has a capacity of just 240.)\n\"This is the first time we've had a professional theatre in the area,\" said executive assistant Annie Jones, who worked on the restoration project for more than five years. \"The programme will list up to nine shows a night \u2013 a mix of comedy, cabaret and theatre all rooted in its community. Waltham Forest has always been welcoming, with its vibrancy, multiculturalism and openness, and its\u00a0spirit has only\u00a0grown.\"\nConnecting Stratford, the Olympic Park and Walthamstow is Leyton. This once-maligned area is now home to one of the most up-and-coming strips in East London. Previously more synonymous with fly-tipping, Tilbury Road railway arches (a narrow alleyway opposite Leyton Midland Road station) has been transformed by new arrivals in the last year alone, including three bars, a bakery, a Caribbean restaurant and two soon-to-open artisan cafes. The opening of two popular microbreweries in the last few years on the same stretch sparked this sudden transformation: Gravity Well, nestled in the station arch itself, and the edgier Libertalia taproom, named after a mythical anarchist colony in the 17th Century.\nFor Leyton-raised Danny Saunders, owner of tropical cocktail bar Leyton Calling (which opened in summer 2024) and cosy candlelit pub Chop Shop Tavern (which opened in February 2025), it's a personal coup, having known the area since the 1980s. \"I've come full circle,\" he said, with a smile. \"My latest bar is in the actual arch where I set up my first car repair business back in the day.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLeyton's rise as a whole has, however, been something of a slow-burn. Back in the mid-2010s, nearby Francis Road began to be taken over by independent creative businesses. \"I opened here in 2017,\" said Aim\u00e9e Madill, who owns Phlox, a bookstore, cafe and wine bar. \"It was risky as it was still a 'less-developed' part of London, but local indie bookshops are more than a business, they're a sign of confidence in a community.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nPedestrianised in 2017, the tree-lined street has since blossomed with chic cafes and bars: two of the latest openings are vinyl store-cum-craft beer bar Dreamhouse Records and Loop Dining, a pop-up space launched in summer 2024 to host weekly residencies from buzzy up-and-coming chefs.\n\"Unlike Stratford,\" Madill said,\u00a0\"Leyton is characterised\u00a0by small makers and creatives existing side by side with businesses who've been here decades. Most of us live here, so we've been able to revitalise, rather than reinvent, parts of the area \u2013 which adds to the sense of community.\"\nSo what's next for outer East London? \"Young people and families are now priced out of Hackney,\" said Michaela Zelenanska, who runs natural wine bar Swirl, which opened in December 2024 on Tilbury Road. \"Leyton and neighbouring Leytonstone seem a logical next big thing. It's small businesses that make the place what it is.\"\nWill London continue to move ever further east? \"We're already engaging with artists, audiences and community groups in Barking and Dagenham,\" said Morton, referencing two outer London suburbs several miles from Leyton and Stratford. \"East London has always been a creative crucible.\"\nStephen Emms is an East London resident who writes a weekly newsletter called Leytonstoner about the arts, food and drink scenes primarily in Leyton, Leytonstone, Stratford and Walthamstow.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "This video can not be played\nChampions League highlights: Barcelona 3-3 Inter Milan\nTeenage Barcelona forward Lamine Yamal said he would not compare himself to Lionel Messi - and then put in a performance a 17-year-old Messi could only have dreamed of in one of the all-time great Champions League semi-final ties.\nIt led to him being called \"a genius\", \"a cheat code\" and \"a phenomenal talent\".\nBarca and Inter Milan ended up drawing 3-3 in their epic first-leg encounter, with visiting full-back Denzel Dumfries involved in all three Inter goals, scoring twice, and being named man of the match.\nBut most of the global headlines will focus on the 17-year-old Yamal, who scored his 22nd goal on his landmark 100th Barcelona game.\nThe remarkable stat being widely shared post-match was a direct comparison with the two greatest players of this generation at the same age - Messi, who had one goal in nine appearances at 17 and Cristiano Ronaldo, who had five goals in 19 appearances before he was 18.\nYamal put on a masterclass, especially in the first half to inspire a superb comeback after Inter had led 2-0 by the 21st minute.\nYamal claimed a classy Champions League semi-final goal to go with one in the Euro 2024 last four last summer. Already one of the best players in the world - and before he even turns 18.\nA picture that says it all - Getty photographer Michael Regan captured this image of Yamal\n\n\"I don't think I have seen a 45 minutes like that from one individual before in my life. It is unbelievable,\" said TNT Sports pundit Ally McCoist as the players walked off the pitch at half-time.\nInter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi gave Yamal the highest of praise afterwards.\n\"Lamine is the kind of talent that comes along every 50 years, and to see him up close really impressed me,\" he said.\n\"He caused us huge problems because we were supposed to double up on him and it wasn't enough.\"\nBarca boss Hansi Flick said: \"He's special, he's a genius. In the big matches, he shows up.\n\"If it only comes every 50 years like Simone said, I'm glad it's for Barcelona.\"\nBBC pundit Stephen Warnock called him \"a future Ballon d'Or winner\".\nOne of the games of the season has everyone excited about the second leg at the San Siro in Milan next week, a change of pace from Paris St-Germain's hard-fought 1-0 win at Arsenal the day before. \n'A very, very special player' - Yamal, 16, makes Euros history\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nThis video can not be played\nLamine Yamal - The Boy King\nThere was a bit of drama before the game when Yamal appeared to hurt his groin and went down the tunnel during the warm-up, with speculation that he might not play.\nHe did start but had barely had an impact before Inter led 2-0 via two fantastic goals - Marcus Thuram's 30-second backheel flick from a Dumfries cross, and Dutchman Dumfries' flying close-range volley.\nBut then Yamal - who was being double marked - came to life, beating a few Inter players before whipping the ball in off the far post with astonishing ease and confidence.\nMoments later, he beat more defenders on the byeline and slammed in a shot which Inter keeper Yann Sommer tipped on to the bar.\nFerran Torres then capped off a fine team move to get Barca level before the break.\nDumfries, though, got his second with a header to put the Italian side back in front.\nBut moments later Barca were level again as Yamal cleverly dummied a pass and Raphinha lashed a shot in from 25 yards which hit the bar and went in off the back of Sommer for an own goal.\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan thought he had made it 4-3 to Inter but his goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.\nYet Yamal almost had the final say, one more memorable moment, when his cross-shot hit the angle of post and bar.\nThis video can not be played\nWarnock on Yamal's 'outrageous' performance against Inter\nIt is tough to even fathom how much Yamal has achieved at his age.\nThis was his 100th Barcelona appearance, and a 22nd goal to go with four in 19 games for Spain.\nYamal has 27 assists too, including two in Saturday's Copa del Rey final extra-time win over Real Madrid.\nMessi and Ronaldo did not make their international debuts until they were 18, while Yamal won Euro 2024 the day after his 17th birthday.\nMessi scored one goal and had no assists before he was 18, with Ronaldo bagging five and four assists.\nYamal is Barcelona's youngest La Liga player (aged 15) and the youngest to score and assist in La Liga for any team.\nHe also holds records for being the youngest Champions League starter, youngest player to score in a knockout game, a quarter-final and now a semi-final.\nYamal is Spain's youngest player and goalscorer and the youngest player and goalscorer in a European Championship.\n'Superstar' Yamal makes more history with Euros triumph\nThis video can not be played\nYamal is a genius, he is special - Flick\nVery few players have had the impact in football by Yamal's age. He will turn 18 in July.\nHe appears to be the closest thing we have seen to Barcelona and Argentina great Messi, now at Inter Miami and arguably the greatest footballer in history.\nThe pair both came through the Barca academy, La Masia, and both play on the right wing.\n\"I don't compare myself to him, because I don't compare myself to anyone - and much less with Messi,\" Yamal told reporters in the build-up to the game, while also describing the Argentine as \"the best player in history\".\nBut Messi was just very, very promising at the age of 17, rather than already regarded as one of the world's best.\nYamal added: \"I don't think the comparison makes sense, with Messi even less - I'm going to enjoy myself, and be myself.\" \nBut he has an unusual bit of history with Messi, who he was photographed with as a baby.\nA photo emerged, external from a charity calendar photoshoot taken at Barcelona's Nou Camp in 2007.\nIn it, a 20-year-old Messi held baby Yamal and helped him have a bath. Yes really.\nThe shoot came about after Unicef did a raffle in the town of Mataro where Lamine's family lived.\n\"We walked down to the city centre and you could tell there is a superstar in this town now in Lamine Yamal,\" said ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand on TNT Sports.\n\"There was a void when Messi left, this kid is doing stuff at 17 we have never seen before. The comfort and ease he plays with is remarkable and he is as at ease off the field.\"\nI don't compare myself to Messi - Barca star Yamal\nThis video can not be played\nHow putting faith in youth revitalised Barcelona\nPundits were in awe at what they saw from Yamal.\nOwen Hargreaves, the former Bayern Munich, Manchester United and England midfielder, called him a \"cheat code\" on TNT.\n\"I just want to see Lamine Yamal get the ball and everybody else get out of the way,\" he added.\nFormer Liverpool and England defender Warnock, watching for BBC's Champions League Match of the Day, said: \"He was unplayable at times. His goal was outrageous.\n\"It's ridiculous watching Yamal. You know, effectively, what he always wants to do \u2013 he wants to come inside on his left foot. So you over-compensate and he has got the ability to drag it with his left foot on to his right foot, and he can actually put a decent ball in with his right foot too.\n\"He is just a phenomenal talent and I love watching him.\"\nAnd Ferdinand wrote on social media: \"As a pure football talent I'm going as far as to say I think Lamine Yamal is on another level to any player playing the game in the top five leagues in world football.

It is unbelievable,\" said TNT Sports pundit Ally McCoist as the players walked off the pitch at half-time.Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi gave Yamal the highest of praise afterwards.",

        "article_text": "A few miles from East London's perennially hip neighbourhoods, an explosion of art and culture is transforming a once-neglected stretch into one of the city's hottest destinations.\nEast London. Two words that, if you know anything about the UK's capital, often conjure up opposing opinions.\nThere are those who mourn its supposedly waning hip factor \u2013 regaling stories of 1980s warehouse art shows or squat parties \u2013 while deploring the rampant commercialism of its supercharged epicentre, Shoreditch. Others, meanwhile, will rave about new independent galleries or small-plate restaurants in nearby Dalston, Bethnal Green or Hackney. Yet, the general consensus is that East London's long-buzzing arts and food scenes are continuing to move ever further out, driven \u2013 as in other world cities \u2013 by the relentless search for affordability.\nBut a few miles east of these oversubscribed neighbourhoods are two boroughs that are lesser known to visitors and have been quietly emerging as London's next artsy enclave: Waltham Forest and Newham. Stretching north from Stratford up to Leyton and Walthamstow, this\u00a0 once-unfashionable outer area hasn't always matched East London's brand of cool. And yet in spring 2025, it's witnessing a cultural explosion, with new museums, theatres and bars and some of the city's biggest arts openings that are putting this under-the-radar corner of London on the map.\nThe catalyst for these boroughs' rise was the 2012 London Olympics, which transformed the area's scrapyards and brownfield land into the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park \u2013 an oasis of rivers, canals and water meadows bordered by Stratford, Leyton and Hackney.\n\"The Olympics brought a huge amount of investment in infrastructure, transport links and housing,\" said Britannia Morton, co-chief executive of Sadler's Wells, the world-famous Islington-based dance theatre founded in the 18th Century. \"The Olympic Park, where our new Sadler's Wells East is based, was created converting marshland into this beautiful environment.\" \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSadler's Wells East, which opened in February 2025, is located in East Bank, a \u00a31.1bn new waterside cultural quarter in the Olympic Park. \"[It was] formerly known as Fridge Mountain \u2013 a dumping ground for old electronic appliances,\" said Morton. The first landmark to open here was the University of the Arts' London College of Fashion in October 2023, which has galleries and a cafe open to the public. Sadler's Wells East was built in Italian red brick and houses a 550-seat state-of-the-art auditorium and six dance studios.\n\"Whether you're interested in ballet, hip-hop, kathak or contemporary, our eclectic programme brings the most innovative work created locally, nationally and internationally to Stratford,\" said Morton. Visitors can enjoy free events in its public spaces, including lunchtime dance classes on the community dance floor, as well as a bar and restaurant. There are panoramic views from its rooftop over the London Aquatics Centre, Sir Anish Kapoor's 114.5m ArcelorMittal Orbit (the UK's largest sculpture) and the London Stadium.\nAcross the park at the Here East innovation and tech campus (formerly the London Olympics Media Centre) is the glass-fronted V&A East Storehouse, opening 31 May 2025. It's the first half of the new V&A East, whose South Kensington-based original is the world's largest museum of applied arts, decorative arts and design, with more than 2.8 million objects in its permanent collection.\nThis first instalment is essentially a new home for the V&A East's reserve collection (hence the name \"Storehouse\"), and \"a magical new behind-the-scenes museum experience\", according to its deputy director and COO Tim Reeve. With 100 curated mini displays, its half a million works range from the\u00a0Glastonbury Festival\u00a0Archive to Dior\u00a0haute couture and mid-century furniture. Its\u00a0world-first Order an Object experience allows anyone to book an appointment to view anything from Roman frescoes to Elton John's costumes. It will also be home to the\u00a0new David Bowie Centre, opening 13 September 2025, displaying the singer's outfits, lyrics and archive.\n\"It's a new standard for access to national collections,\" said Reeve. \"We're encouraging visitors to feel empowered to make their own journeys through the V&A's global collections.\"\nThe second half, the five-storey V&A East Museum, is opening in East Bank in spring 2026. Its main exhibition hall will celebrate leading artists, designers and performers in major shows, and its galleries will narrate stories of East London's creative and manufacturing heritage.\nElsewhere in East Bank, BBC Music Studios, which will house the BBC Symphony Orchestra and host recording sessions and live performances, is slated to open in late 2025 or early 2026.\nAnd that's not all. A couple of miles north in Walthamstow, another major cultural opening is happening. While this diverse north-east London suburb has long been thriving \u2013 its pretty village centre, some of which dates to the 15th Century, is indeed a gentrification hotspot \u2013 the imposing new Soho Theatre Walthamstow will further raise the neighbourhood's profile when it opens on 2 May 2025. A former cinema designed in 1930 by architect Cecil Masey, the distinctive building was inspired by the Moorish architecture of the 13th-Century Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. In its mid-20th-Century heyday, it also hosted gigs by The Beatles, Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Dusty Springfield, Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones \u2013 before closing in 2003.\nMore like this:\n\u2022 London Overground: Four stops to explore the 'real' London\n\u2022 Five unusual historical experiences in London\n\u2022 See another side to London at eight of its most unusual tourist attractions\nWhen it finally reopens, with its original Art Deco stylings revived, the Soho Theatre Walthamstow will have a 960-seat Grade II-listed auditorium, studio spaces, four bars and a restaurant. (In comparison, its current West End location has a capacity of just 240.)\n\"This is the first time we've had a professional theatre in the area,\" said executive assistant Annie Jones, who worked on the restoration project for more than five years. \"The programme will list up to nine shows a night \u2013 a mix of comedy, cabaret and theatre all rooted in its community. Waltham Forest has always been welcoming, with its vibrancy, multiculturalism and openness, and its\u00a0spirit has only\u00a0grown.\"\nConnecting Stratford, the Olympic Park and Walthamstow is Leyton. This once-maligned area is now home to one of the most up-and-coming strips in East London. Previously more synonymous with fly-tipping, Tilbury Road railway arches (a narrow alleyway opposite Leyton Midland Road station) has been transformed by new arrivals in the last year alone, including three bars, a bakery, a Caribbean restaurant and two soon-to-open artisan cafes. The opening of two popular microbreweries in the last few years on the same stretch sparked this sudden transformation: Gravity Well, nestled in the station arch itself, and the edgier Libertalia taproom, named after a mythical anarchist colony in the 17th Century.\nFor Leyton-raised Danny Saunders, owner of tropical cocktail bar Leyton Calling (which opened in summer 2024) and cosy candlelit pub Chop Shop Tavern (which opened in February 2025), it's a personal coup, having known the area since the 1980s. \"I've come full circle,\" he said, with a smile. \"My latest bar is in the actual arch where I set up my first car repair business back in the day.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLeyton's rise as a whole has, however, been something of a slow-burn. Back in the mid-2010s, nearby Francis Road began to be taken over by independent creative businesses. \"I opened here in 2017,\" said Aim\u00e9e Madill, who owns Phlox, a bookstore, cafe and wine bar. \"It was risky as it was still a 'less-developed' part of London, but local indie bookshops are more than a business, they're a sign of confidence in a community.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nPedestrianised in 2017, the tree-lined street has since blossomed with chic cafes and bars: two of the latest openings are vinyl store-cum-craft beer bar Dreamhouse Records and Loop Dining, a pop-up space launched in summer 2024 to host weekly residencies from buzzy up-and-coming chefs.\n\"Unlike Stratford,\" Madill said,\u00a0\"Leyton is characterised\u00a0by small makers and creatives existing side by side with businesses who've been here decades. Most of us live here, so we've been able to revitalise, rather than reinvent, parts of the area \u2013 which adds to the sense of community.\"\nSo what's next for outer East London? \"Young people and families are now priced out of Hackney,\" said Michaela Zelenanska, who runs natural wine bar Swirl, which opened in December 2024 on Tilbury Road. \"Leyton and neighbouring Leytonstone seem a logical next big thing. It's small businesses that make the place what it is.\"\nWill London continue to move ever further east? \"We're already engaging with artists, audiences and community groups in Barking and Dagenham,\" said Morton, referencing two outer London suburbs several miles from Leyton and Stratford. \"East London has always been a creative crucible.\"\nStephen Emms is an East London resident who writes a weekly newsletter called Leytonstoner about the arts, food and drink scenes primarily in Leyton, Leytonstone, Stratford and Walthamstow.\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

Poilievre grew up in Alberta, however, and will likely win handily as the constituency he is running in is a Conservative stronghold.\nA big question is whether Poilievre still has the backing of his own party to stay on as leader.  Mr Chambers said the answer, so far, is a resounding yes.\n\"Pierre has a lot of support in the caucus,\" he said. \"I don't think there's anybody that wants him removed, or that has super high ambitions that wants to replace him as leader.\"\nA number of high-profile Conservatives have already rallied behind him. One of them is Andrew Scheer, a current MP and former leader of the party, who said Poilievre should stay on to \"ensure we finish the job next time\".\nOthers are casting blame on where they went wrong.\nJamil Jivani, who won his own constituency in a suburb of Toronto handily, felt that Ontario leader Doug Ford had betrayed the conservative movement and cost the party the election.\nThe federal and provincial Conservative parties are legally different entities, though they belong to the same ideological tent, and Ford is leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party.\nHe frequently made headlines during the election campaign for his get-tough attitude with Donald Trump and the US president's trade war. \n\"He couldn't stay out of our business,\" Jivani told a CBC reporter.\nJivani, who in a past life attended Yale University with US Vice-President JD Vance, where the two became good friends, accused Ford of distracting from the federal Conservatives' campaign and of \"positioning himself as some political genius that we need to be taking cues from\".\nBut Mr Chambers, the Conservative strategist, said that Poilievre will also need to confront where the party fell short.\nPoilievre, who is known for his combative political style, has struggled with being unlikeable among the general Canadian public.\nHe has also failed to shore up the support of popular Conservative leaders in some provinces, like Ontario's Ford, who did not campaign for Poilievre despite his recent landslide victory in a provincial election earlier this year. Ford did, however, post a photo of him and Liberal leader Mark Carney having a coffee.\n\"Last time I checked, Pierre Poilievre never came out in our election,\" Ford told reporters earlier this week. \"Matter of fact, he or one of his lieutenants told every one of his members, 'don't you dare go out and help'\".\n\"Isn't that ironic?\"\nAnother Conservative premier, Tim Houston of Nova Scotia - who also did not campaign for Poilievre - said the federal party needs to do some \"soul-searching\" after its loss.\n\"I think the Conservative Party of Canada was very good at pushing people away, not so good at pulling people in,\" Houston said.\nNot every premier stood on the sidelines. Poilievre was endorsed by Alberta's Danielle Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, both western Conservatives.\nKory Teneycke, Ford's campaign manager, who publicly criticised Poilievre's campaign during the election, angering federal Conservatives, rejected the notion that Ford's failure to endorse Poilievre had cost him the election.\nHe told the BBC that, to him, the bigger problem was Poilievre's failure to unite Conservative voters in Canada.\n\"What constitutes a Conservative in different parts of the country can look quite different,\" he said, adding that Poilievre's populist rhetoric and aggressive style appealed to Conservatives in the west, but alienated those in the east.\n\"There was a lot of Trump mimicry in terms of how they presented the campaign,\" Mr Teneycke said. \n\"Donald Trump is public enemy number one to most in Canada, and I don't think it was coming across very well.\"\nHe added he believes some of the \"soul-searching\" by Poilievre's Conservatives will need to include a plan of how to build a coalition of the right in a country \"as big and diverse as Canada\".\nAsked by reporters what it would take to heal the rift, Ford answered: \"All they have to do is make a phone call.\"",

It has been used by Trump to deport Venezuelans to El Salvador on the basis they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang and \"conducting irregular warfare\".\nThe judge said the act only applied when the US was facing an \"armed organised attack\", which it is not. The administration has not commented.\nPresident Trump in March issued a proclamation claiming that Tren de Aragua was invading the US, and justified the use of special powers to deport immigrants identified as gang members without court proceedings.\nHe used the act to deport two plane loads of alleged migrant gang members to the El Salvadoran terrorism prison known as Cecot. \nNeither the US government nor El Salvador has provided details of the deportees' alleged criminality or gang membership.\nThe ruling is the first time a federal judge has ruled the use of the act is \"unlawful\". \n\"The historical record renders clear that the president's invocation of the AEA... is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms,\" the judge wrote. \n\"As a result, the court concludes that as a matter of law, the executive branch cannot rely on the AEA... to detain the named petitioners... or to remove them from the country.\"\nThe judge pushed back against the Trump administration's argument that the president's use of the act was beyond the purview of the courts.\n\"Allowing the president to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the executive branch's authority under the AEA,\" he said\nHe added that allowing such a move would \"strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting Congressional statutes\".  \nThe Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before in US history - during World War Two, World War One and the War of 1812.",

But 20 \u2013 30 of the animals have been trapped annually since.Saving Nature Outer Hebrides said the current programme of trapping \"was not enough\" but a total eradication of the animals was \"feasible\".NATURE SCOTPopulations of birds including including ducks, terns, lapwings and red-throated divers have started to returnDavid Maclennan, head of operations for Nature Scot in west Scotland, said: \"Thanks to the prolonged efforts of the Hebridean Mink Project, the mink population in the Outer Hebrides has been reduced to extremely low levels with significant positive consequences for ground nesting birds.\"It's clear, however, that the existing level of trapping has not been enough to completely eradicate mink from the islands.\"We believe that while it will be challenging, total removal is feasible and in the long term offers both the most effective protection for our native wildlife and the most cost-effective solution to the problem.\"Seabirds return after mink 'eradication'ConservationWildlifeIsle of North UistIsle of BenbeculaComhairle nan Eilean Siar",

        "article_text": "The top US health department plans to require placebo testing for all vaccines in an effort to offer \"straightforward\" public health information, but experts say such testing could limit availability and raise ethical concerns. \nIn a statement first given to the Washington Post, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said this week, \"All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure \u2014 a radical departure from past practices\". \nThe agency did not provide details on which \"new vaccines\" would be included. \nBut officials have suggested that updated Covid-19 shots may be included, which vaccine experts say could slow down vaccine access.  \nPeter Lurie, a former official with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said \"it's hard to tell exactly what is being proposed.\"  \n\"But, broadly, if they mean that every modification to an existing vaccine would require a new placebo-controlled trial, they are treading in ethically dubious territory and likely to deny Americans life-saving vaccines at some point.\"\nHHS has not offered details on the timing of the placebo plan or specify the vaccines involved. \nAn HHS spokesperson told the BBC in a statement that health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's goal of \"radical transparency\" means being \"honest and straightforward about what we know \u2014 and what we don't know \u2014 about medical products, including vaccines\". \nThe statement said none of the childhood vaccines recommended in the US  - except the Covid shot - had undergone \"inert placebo\" testing, meaning \"we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products\". \nBut public health experts say the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including ones for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio and the mumps, were all initially tested against a placebo. In fact, all new immunizations already go through the trials - a type of random testing where one test group receives the immunization, and the other gets a placebo, like a saline shot. \nBut newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process, because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group, and because the shot is only being tweaked in a minor way, vaccine experts said. \nThe coronavirus shot, for example, already has gone through rigorous safety testing, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\"We have a lot of information about the safety of the vaccine,\" he said. \"All we're doing this year is using a different Omicron variant that we used last year and the year before that.\" \nStill, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said this week that the agency was \"taking a look\" at updated coronavirus shots, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News that there is a \"void of data\". \nAn HHS spokesperson told the BBC that \"significant updates to existing vaccines\" may be considered \"new products\" requiring additional clinical evaluation.\n\"A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years,\" the spokesperson said. \nRequiring companies to conduct placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly - and the drug makers could ultimately decide to forgo making the newer, more effective versions of the vaccine altogether, said Dr Lurie.\nBefore taking office - and since assuming the role as secretary - Kennedy has spread   false claims about vaccine safety. His tenure has coincided with one of the worst measles outbreaks in a decade; two children have died and 660 people have been infected in Texas. \nThis week, he encouraged parents to \"do their own research\" about the measles vaccine - which has been considered safe and 97% effective for decades - and raised questions about whether the shot could cause seizures or neurological issues. \nFor months, he has at times endorsed the MMR shot, and at other times, called it a \"personal\" decision. Kennedy also promoted alternative treatments, which doctors say patients should not use without medical supervision. ",

The relationship with media in other countries - Pereira has worked in Portugal, Brazil, Greece, Turkey, Saudi and China - is very different. \nBut if interviewing a Premier League manager in a pub sounds both highly unusual and also a throwback to the 1980s, the setting makes more sense given the 56-year-old's habit of celebrating wins by \"being with the people\".\n\"First the points, then the pints\" was a phrase coined by Pereira which has transferred to the stands, with the words now adorning a banner at Molineux. \nIt came as Wolves battled the drop, but a run of six straight wins, their best in the top flight for 55 years, has the club now safely mid-table in the Premier League. \nPereira has endeared himself to Wolves supporters, and the city, with his desire to understand them and the area. \nTrips to the local Wetherspoons near the train station after victories have become a fixture - with Molineux serenading him with 'We'll see you in 'Spoons' during Saturday's 3-0 win over Leicester.\n\"What do we do in Wolverhampton after a game? If I lose the game I stay home and drink my beer alone. If I win the game, I go with the supporters to celebrate,\"  Pereira tells BBC Sport.\n\"The connection with the people is stronger when we suffer together and, when you are in a situation where you are fighting for survival, you feel this connection.\n\"In the moments we are suffering, you feel we are suffering together. In the moments of celebration, you need to be with them.\n\"In Wolverhampton, where do you want me to go? I must go to a pub, because this is the culture and where people go.\n\"When I go to a pub it's not about the beer. Of course I like the beer but I go to be with the people, to feel that I'm doing something to make them happy, to make them proud.\n\"Work, home, then we go to a pub just for a beer or two beers and finish. This is our life.\"\nWolves have adopted Vitor Pereira's phrase after his success at Molineux \nThe down-to-earth philosophy comes from Pereira's upbringing.\nGrowing up on the coast in Espinho, 10 miles south of Porto, he recalls the harsh conditions he endured which have shaped him. \n\"It was a very humble village with fishermen and we grew up on the street,\" he said. \n\"Fighting together, fighting for the space. Competing and fighting. But this is what I have inside of me. This is the power.\n\"My house was 50 metres from the beach. At the time my father didn't have money so we lived in a 'basement'.\n\"The sea, in the winter, came strong, without barriers. Every winter, for three months, there was water inside. We had to rebuild the house. Every time there was water in the walls and a bad smell. I felt ashamed because my clothes smelled.\n\"You felt wet every time, that was our life.\n\"[Yet] I was a very happy teenager at the time because in this kind of community we have the confident guys together. When I look back, this power I feel inside of me came from this time.\"\nVisit all of BBC Sport's Wolves content\nHis playing career, Pereira readily admits, was underwhelming. He played as a midfielder for lesser-known Portuguese clubs Avanca, Oliveirense, Esmoriz, Estarreja, Fiaes and Sao Joao de Ver and retired at 28. \nYet it was enough to help put him through a sports course at the University of Porto, as he finished second in his class while completing his coaching qualifications. \n\"I had a career, it was in the third division in Portugal but I got the money to do my course, to go to the university, to buy my car, to buy my clothes,\" he said. \n\"Since I was 16 years-old, I never asked for one euro from my parents. After 16, small jobs, to get money, to go to the discos.\n\"On Saturdays, I was a lifeguard on the beach. They paid me a lot of money. I saw the sun and I saved people.\n\"I was 18 and 19 at that time - no worries. I went to the university. I did some small jobs to get some money and I started to save. I'm now 56. But my sons will spend the money, don't worry!\"\nHis three sons are all in their 20s and Pereira, who always felt being a coach was his calling, does not want - or expect - them to follow him into football. \n\"The sacrifices you have to make. I don't want this life for my sons,\" he says. \n\"They cannot have a family life in this job. It's impossible. We have a lot of moments where we suffer a lot and alone. I think we are always in a pre-depression.\n\"For me, the competition is like a drug. Passion and a drug. I cannot live without it because after one month I start to be nervous. I cannot enjoy nothing.\"\nPereira met BBC Sport and other journalists in a local pub for an on-record interview\n\"I want to recharge with their energy\" - Pereira celebrates with Wolves fans after beating Manchester United\nIt is clear Pereira misses his family, having travelled the globe since he started managing Padroense juniors in 2003. \nHe eventually became Porto assistant, to Andre Villas-Boas, and was in that role when they won the Europa League in 2011, replacing Villas-Boas when he moved to Chelsea.\nHis first game was against Pep Guardiola's Barcelona in the Super Cup, a 2-0 defeat,  but he won successive Primeira Liga titles before joining Al-Ahli and then Olympiacos, lifting the Greek Super League.\nSpells at 1860 Munich, Shanghai, Fenerbahce, Corinthians, Flamengo and Al Shabab followed before he joined Wolves, yet the intensity of management is not something which bothers him. \nHe said: \"I cannot speak about this because I don't want to cry, I have moments in my life. When I arrived in Brazil, I went to Corinthians. If you see the stadium of Corinthians and Flamengo, they have millions of supporters.\n\"When I met the press they ask me, 'Vitor, you don't feel the pressure?'. I'll tell you about the pressure. The pressure was when my father had cancer, my brother was dying, my mother was crying.\n\"When we deal with this, football is football. I don't feel any pressure, nothing. Zero. believe me.\"\nWolves go to Manchester City on Friday without pressure - after their 1-0 win at Manchester United in April that sealed survival with five games remaining.\nThere will be change in the summer after this season's brush with relegation. Matheus Cunha is expected to leave, with Manchester United interested, and the Brazil forward, who has scored 15 goals, has a \u00a362.5m release clause. \nPereira insists he cannot second-guess what will happen with Cunha, but that he will \"wish him the best\" either way. He says the 25-year-old has not directly told him he wants to leave, but is adamant he needs the power to shape the squad. \nMany will feel he has earned it. \nOnly champions Liverpool and Newcastle have won more games than Pereira's 10 in his 18 matches since he replaced Gary O'Neil in December - while Wolves have won more points than relegated trio of Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton combined in that same period.\nWolves were second bottom and five points adrift of the Foxes when he took over, they are now 23 ahead and 13th. Pereira will not need to buy another drink in Wolverhampton. \n\"Every time, I think I can do better and better and better because I just expressed half of myself,\" he adds. \n\"I have a lot to prove. If I'm in the right place to challenge me, I can do magic. Believe me.\"\n'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show\nEx-West Ham boss Lopetegui named Qatar manager",

He is likely to be joined in the squad by Matthew Potts (10 caps), Josh Tongue (two) and uncapped Essex man Sam Cook.\nA combination in the XI of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook would have 13 caps between them. Not since Zimbabwe's last Test in this country 22 years ago has England's pace attack looked so callow at home, when Steve Harmison, James Anderson and Richard Johnson had a combined seven caps.\nIndeed, England have played only one home Test without any of Woakes, Anderson or Stuart Broad in the past 18 years.\nAlthough Zimbabwe are improving \u2013 they have just earned a creditable 1-1 series draw in Bangladesh \u2013 England will be overwhelming favourites to win the four-day Test when it begins on 22 May.\nFollowing that, the five-match series at home to India and the Ashes away in Australia this winter will shape the leadership legacies of Stokes, coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key.\n'Times have changed, one clip can earn an England call-up'\nWe've said naive things, but we do care - Wood\nWoakes has not played yet this season because of an ankle problem, while Wood is out until July following knee surgery.\nBrydon Carse remains sidelined with a foot problem and Olly Stone will not play before the back end of the summer after his own knee operation. Ollie Robinson, who has won 20 Test caps, has not played for England in more than a year and lost his central contract in October.\nAll-rounder Stokes, with 210 Test wickets, has more scalps than any other active England bowler, though his bowling is likely to be restricted. An injury sustained in the third Test against New Zealand in December was the second time in five months the talismanic captain had hurt his left hamstring.\nStokes will look to build his bowling in the run-up to the India series, when England will hope to have Woakes and Carse available. Jofra Archer could play his first red-ball game in four years for England Lions against India A in June. Speaking on Wednesday, Wood did not rule out a return for the conclusion of the India series.\nFor now, Atkinson will lead the attack following his stunning debut year in Test cricket while Potts played in England's last Test in New Zealand.\nTongue has not played for England for two years because of injuries but has enjoyed a superb start to the season with Nottinghamshire.\nCook, 27, has been the outstanding bowler in domestic cricket for some time, grabbing 318 first-class wickets at an average under 20.\nHe is not blessed with high pace and has had to wait for his chance, yet an indication an England call-up was on the horizon came when it was requested he be rested from Essex's Championship match against Worcestershire last month.\nIf England feel they want further pace cover in the squad, it could come from 20-year-old left-armer Josh Hull, who made his Test debut last summer, or Hampshire's exciting prospect Sonny Baker. Baker has played only three first-class matches but was given an England development contract in February.\nOther areas of selection look more straightforward. Jamie Smith will return behind the stumps after missing the tour of New Zealand on paternity leave, while there is no suggestion Shoaib Bashir's place as the number one spinner is under threat.\nAny decisions over the top five will be delayed by Jacob Bethell's stint at the Indian Premier League. If batting cover is required, Jordan Cox has recovered from the broken thumb that prevented his debut in New Zealand and Durham opener Ben McKinney is highly rated.\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

        "article_text": "From Tina Fey's new relationship comedy to an action drama from the creator of Lost, and the return of Sarah Jessica Parker and co in the third season of the Sex and the City sequel.\nTine Fey stars in and co-created this comedy about three couples, long-time friends with enough disposable income to vacation together four times a year through different seasons. As in the 1981 film it is based on, everyone is rattled when one pair heads for divorce. Fey and Will Forte play one of the couples. Colman Domingo and Marco Calvani are another, a same-sex twist that is the most obvious update from '81. And Steve Carell plays a man who is leaving his wife (Kerri Kenney-Silver) for a younger woman (Erika Henningsen), a timeless part of the plot. Fey has called the show \"a love letter to long-term relationships, both platonic and romantic\", adding, \"I hope audiences feel like they are inside a big sweater with us, and also having a dinner party with us.\" So if you like dinner parties in chunky sweaters, this is the show for you.\nThe Four Seasons premieres 1 May on Netflix internationally\nStar Natasha Lyonne and creator Rian Johnson (Knives Out) have brought their popular homage to the classic Peter Falk series Columbo, and 1970s television in general, back for a second season. Lyonne stars as Charlie Cale, who has an incredible knack for running across murders, scoping out who's telling the truth and who's lying, and solving the case by the end of the episode. Now on the run from a different crime boss than in the first season, Charlie is still on the road, travelling to a different place in every episode, each featuring a slew of guest stars. This time they include Cynthia Erivo, Awkwafina, Giancarlo Esposito, Kumail Nanjiani, John Mulaney, Katie Holmes and about two dozen others, as Charlie stumbles across trouble at a funeral home, a baseball game and an alligator farm. Running through it all are Lyonne's trademark sardonic delivery and the series's fast-paced retro feel.\u00a0\nPoker Face premieres 8 May on Peacock in the US and Sky Max and NOW in the UK\nJudy Blume's 1975 YA novel about first love is reimagined with an update in this series set in Los Angeles in 2018, with a cast largely composed of black actors. High school students Keisha (Lovie Simone), a track star, and Justin (Michael Cooper Jr), a basketball player, are childhood friends who lost touch. When they meet again at a party and fall in love, they face all the intense feelings and decisions that brings. Over the years, Blume's novel has been banned in several US states for the direct way its characters confront the question of when to have their first sexual experience (Blume's honesty is exactly what many fans like about her) and the issue needed a new lens for the 21st Century. But the series' showrunner, Mara Brock Akil, has also leant into the timeless theme of romance, and the Los Angeles setting feeds into it. \"What better metaphor for this love story than what LA represents,\" she has said. \"You're looking for a place to follow your dreams, and love is a part of that.\"\nForever premieres 8 May on Netflix internationally\nRetro television is having a moment with Poker Face and this action drama set in 1972 in the Southwest US. JJ Abrams is an executive producer and, along with LaToya Morgan, wrote the first two episodes of the series, which stars Josh Holloway, still best known as Sawyer from Abrams's Lost, as a swaggering driver for a crime syndicate. Rachel Hilson plays the first black female FBI agent, who chases him down, with Keith David as the syndicate's boss. In addition to the cat-and-mouse crime story and possibly wavering loyalties, Duster has knife fights, cars flipping over and dust all around. Abrams told The Hollywood Reporter that the series came about because \"I had this image of a phone booth in the middle of the desert and a car driving up, and a guy getting on the phone to find out where he was meant to go next\".\u00a0 That turned into a show that he calls \"a crazy story\" with humour, absurdity and lots of plot turns.\nDuster premieres 15 May on Max in the US\nTelevision is full of sci-fi series, but this one has a comic twist and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, as a robot who manages to hack his own system and go rogue. \"I am a security unit,\" he announces in his cheery voiceover. \"I was built to protect and obey humans. And humans are idiots.\" Chris and Paul Weitz (About a Boy) created the show, based on Martha Wells' series of books, The Murderbot Diaries, and have given it a Blade Runner-meets-Black Mirror style. Although the title robot calls himself Murderbot, he doesn't really want to kill anyone. He prefers sitting around bingeing his favourite show, The Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon, a series-within-the-series with John Cho and Jack McBrayer playing the leads. When he lands on a new planet, his social awkwardness creates a very human problem, which makes him, Skarsg\u00e5rd told Empire magazine, \"more relatable than most characters I've ever played\". Of course, he has played Tarzan and a vampire, so relatable is a relative thing.\nMurderbot premieres 16 May on Apple TV+ internationally\nNicole Kidman and her collection of improbable wigs \u2013 see The Undoing or The Perfect Couple \u2013 are now television mainstays. In season two of this series based on a Liane Moriarty novel, she returns as psychedelic-dispensing wellness guru Masha Dmitrichenko, still Russian-accented but now with a pin-straight bob instead of a waist-length mop of waves. She has also relocated her week-long retreat from sunny California to the snowy Austrian Alps, where another crop of troubled, privileged characters turn up \u2013 like The White Lotus but with a cult-like, possibly charlatan therapist. As Kidman told Vanity Fair about Masha, \"She morphs. She adapts.\" New characters are played by another starry cast, including Henry Golding, Christine Baranski, Mark Strong, Lena Olin and Murray Bartlett. Let the wig-games begin. Vulture has even ranked them.\nNine Perfect Strangers premieres 21 May on Hulu in the US and 22 May on Amazon Prime Video in the UK\nJulianne Moore and Meghann Fahy star in this dark comedy about power, class and control, set over one weekend on a wealthy resort island. Moore plays Michaela, a philanthropist and animal activist who is also iron-fisted in her control of island society. Her personal assistant, Simone (Milly Alcock, who played the younger Rhaenyra Targaryen in House of the Dragons), is so in thrall to her that Simone's sister, Devon, (Fahy) comes to the island to stage an intervention. Kevin Bacon plays Michaela's billionaire husband, with Glenn Howerton and Bill Camp among the supporting cast. The series was created by Molly Smith Metzler, who also created the hit Netflix series Maid. She based Sirens on her 2011 play Elemeno Pea, and has said that the show has \"a Greek mythology vibe\", presumably because Michaela sends out such a siren's call to Simone. But details are scarce, so for all we know this siren, as in mythology, could turn out to be half bird. Fully human or not, Moore is always worth watching.\nSirens premieres 22 May on Netflix internationally\nMatthew Goode stars in this crime thriller, the latest show from Scott Frank, the creator of terrific series including The Queen's Gambit and Monsieur Spade. The hero, Carl Morck (Goode), is an abrasive detective in Edinburgh whose partner has been paralyzed on the job, sending him into a tailspin and landing him a low-profile role as head of a new cold-case unit called Department Q. Headquartered in a basement, his unit of misfits is meant to be no more than a publicity move for the police \u2013 but as in Slow Horses, the band of outcasts is smarter than their prized colleagues. Frank based the show on a series of Danish novels and changed the setting to Edinburgh, where it was shot. Meanwhile, Morck has been made into an Englishman, a fish out of water whose ex-wife is Scottish, which accounts for his very bad attitude toward all Scots. The top-flight cast includes Kelly Macdonald and Shirley Henderson.\nDept Q premieres 29 May on Netflix internationally\nAn unlikely family tangle is beneath the plot of this thriller with Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks as estranged sisters who have very different lives. Biel plays Chloe, a polished media executive who lives in upscale comfort with her lawyer husband (Corey Stoll) and teenage son. Banks plays Nicky, a recovering addict who is struggling financially. When someone in the family is murdered, the death and their old sibling rivalry converge, as the sisters come together to find the truth of what happened. Lorraine Toussaint, Matthew Modine and Gloria Reuben are also in the cast. Olivia Milch, who co-created the show with Regina Corrado (based on a 2019 novel by Alafair Burke) told Glamour that the question of which sister is better \"changes moment to moment\", which sounds just right for a thriller.\nThe Better Sister premieres 29 May on Prime Video internationally\nAs she ambles into her next chapter in life, nearly 30 years after Sex and the City premiered, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) still has great shoes, as seen in the trailer for the third season of this sequel series. The new season puts her where the last one ended, in a new apartment and trying a long-distance relationship with Aiden (John Corbett). But Carrie is now writing a novel, instead of the personal column she used to write. As always, Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) have their own issues. Sarita Choudhury and Nicole Ari Parker return as recently-acquired core friends Seema and Lisa, while Rosie O'Donnell and Patti LuPone appear as brand new characters. The show has inspired long-loyal, opinionated fans, who will want to know whether or not two old favourites are missing: Che Diaz (Sarah Ramirez), Miranda's former partner who was a love-them or hate-them character, and Kim Cattrall, whose phoned-in cameo as Samantha last season \u2013 really, she was shown in a car on the phone for a minute \u2013 was a fizzle.\nAnd Just Like That\u2026 premieres 29 May on Max in the US and Sky Max and NOW in the UK\n--\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "A second-hand Zelda cartridge. A cryptic forum thread. A generation of frightened children. This is the story of Ben Drowned \u2013 the internet's most infamous video game ghost.\nIt was Christmas Eve and 10-year-old Saarthak Johri couldn't sleep \u2013 but not because of excitement. He was shot through with fear. It was roughly a decade ago and Johri was a kid growing up in Saginaw, Michigan, in the US. He had spent the day slumped in an easy chair, staring at his phone, totally absorbed in an online urban myth. Johri knew it wasn't real, it couldn't be. And yet, he was powerless to get it out of his mind.\nHe had found a trail of old forum posts supposedly written by a college student. The student, who used the online pseudonym Jadusable, had bought a strange copy of a Nintendo 64 video game at a yard sale. It was The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, a notoriously dark instalment in the Zelda franchise, released 25 years ago this week on 27 April 2000.\nMajora's Mask is full of unnerving discussions about death, denial, fear, regret \u2013 and a looming apocalypse. But something was off about the cartridge Jadusable found. It had no label, just \"Majora\" scribbled on the plastic in marker. And something was seriously wrong with it.\nJadusable wrote that the game's familiar graphics were strange and distorted. Music played backwards in a spine-chilling loop. Worst of all, he was plagued by a terrifying statue of the main character, Link, with a petrified grimace on its face. It kept appearing in the game out of nowhere \u2013 like a digital ghost. On YouTube, Jadusable posted video evidence of everything he had described. This game cartridge, it seemed, was haunted \u2013 inhabited by the spirit of its former owner, a child named Ben who had drowned in a tragic accident. Johri pored over every detail, rapt with morbid curiosity.\nAs the story unfolded through roughly 11,000-words of forum entries posted over the course of weeks, Jadusable described a haunting that soon extended beyond the game to other areas of his life. Eventually, after a series of increasingly disturbing experiences, the forum posts ceased, and Jadusable was never heard from again. This urban legend burst onto the web in 2010, traumatising a generation of young internet users. It became known as \"Ben Drowned\".\nBen Drowned left an indelible mark on the web and continues to spawn art and fan fiction long after it emerged. Though lesser-known outside gaming circles, the story and its accompanying videos racked up millions of views and have inspired other narratives in a similar vein.\nAt its core, Ben Drowned is a story about a ghost in a machine \u2013 one that speaks to our deepest fears about new technology. But it's more than an effective urban legend. Ben Drowned is a myth born from a medium that shaped a generation. In an era when video games were still often seen as a frivolous pastime for children, Ben Drowned was early proof that society's relationship with video games goes beyond childhood nostalgia, tapping into our deepest emotions \u2013 and maybe even our souls.\nBy the time Johri stumbled on Ben Drowned in around 2015, it was already widely acknowledged as fiction. But that didn't matter. That night, on Christmas Eve, as Johri lay in bed wrestling with insomnia, he could see in his mind's eye that creepy statue's grimace projected onto the faces of his family members. Rumour had it that Ben, the ghost from the corrupted Majora's Mask cartridge, had gone on to torment other people besides Jadusable. That's what the adolescent Johri couldn't shake, however irrational it seemed. The idea that Ben's evil presence might be out there. That it could spread.\nYears earlier, in September 2010, a real-life college student called Alex Hall hit \"publish\" on a forum post that would change his life forever. Hall had just started his second year at Saint Louis University in Missouri, US. He wasn't a fan of college. Here was his first taste of freedom as a so-called adult, and yet there were still all these classes to attend. He dreamt of becoming a famous author.\nAt the time, content called \"copypastas\" had become popular on forums such as 4chan and Something Awful. The term refers to the practice of copying and pasting blocks of text online, an early means of going viral \u2013 if such text proved popular enough to be shared widely. Ben Drowned is a canonical entry in an influential subgenre of copypasta called \"creepypasta\" \u2013 horror stories whose origins often become obscured as they spread across the web, thus adding to the mystery. Slender Man, a legend that was eventually turned into a big budget movie, is probably the most famous example.\nBy 2010, creepypastas had become extremely popular. But few of these stories concerned video games \u2013 despite the significance of games as cultural artefacts by that point. There were some examples, though, such as Polybius \u2013 a story that spread online in the early 2000s about mythical arcade game said to be part of a US government conspiracy.\nHall decided that the internet was missing something: an in-depth, video game-themed creepypasta. Gradually, his idea began to form: a haunted cartridge, a series of hoax-like forum posts, a narrator targeted by the evil entity within the game, and videos to back up these claims.\nHall knew how to make such videos using software to mod (modify) a game. He chose to use that software on Majora's Mask, Hall's favourite at the time. \"That game, to me, felt like the most alive video game that I had ever played, really,\" he says. Characters talk at length about their grief, or express denial about their impending doom, even while the moon, which is on a collision course with the world, edges closer and closer overhead. \"They have hopes and dreams,\" adds Hall.\nThe tale Hall came up with developed and amplified the grim mood of Majora's Mask, using the game as a springboard for a folk story about a troubled gamer. Hall's narrative leans on ominous lines of dialogue from the game. Most notably: \"You shouldn't have done that.\"\nThe idea of a haunted Nintendo 64 cartridge came in part from Hall's own experience of trawling through yard sales for video games. He once found a copy of Star Wars Episode I: Racer, based on the pod-racing sequence from that film. \"I was so bad at that game,\" recalls Hall. But the copy he found had a complete save file on it from the previous owner, meaning he could play as all the racers without having to unlock them first. This planted the seed that old game cartridges sometimes harboured surprises.\n\"A big part of gamer culture has always been about finding the secrets in different games,\" says John Sanders, assistant professor of English who studies media and literature at Appalachian State University in North Carolina, US. But while gamers seek to master the games they play, Ben Drowned is about a nightmare opposite scenario \u2013 this is a game that will master you.\nSanders points out that people have long told stories about corrupted or haunted media. The possessed game cartridge is just the latest in a line that includes ghostly radio broadcasts, cursed videotapes and demonic books. In Ben Drowned, Hall dangled the possibility that Ben might be able to haunt the reader too, via their computer. Another age-old ghost story trope: you're next.\nAfter months of toil, Hall finally published his creation. A few days later, he woke up and logged on, bleary-eyed, to his YouTube channel. The first video he'd posted for the story had jumped up to nearly 2,000 views. Hall had never had such a response online before, and the view counter just kept ticking upwards. He picked up the phone and called his father. \"Dad,\" Hall croaked, \"I think I've done something here.\"\n\"I actually remember reading it in my dorm room in college and sending it to some of my friends,\" says Alexander Zawacki, a digital humanities lecturer at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in Germany, who describes the thrill of discovering creepypastas through links shared on internet forums. Readers felt as though they were \"getting into something a little bit secret\", he adds.\nZawacki is one of a few researchers who have published academic papers about Ben Drowned. It is a classic example of a spooky story that employs childhood nostalgia, he says \u2013 like horror films peppered with dolls, clowns and little children. \"They feel like relics of the past that come back to haunt you,\" says Zawacki.\nBen Drowned is a story that proves video games can be just as evocative.\nThat's significant, says Sanders. As video games matured, gaining more sophisticated graphics, complex characters and intricate storylines, they have given rise to entire subcultures \u2013 ardent gamers who trade knowledge about lore, cheat codes or hidden loot. They spend many hours exploring the digital worlds in the games they adore and sharing tales about the things they've seen that most people wouldn't believe.\nGamers' obsessions were leading to a \"boiling point\", adds Sanders, where a story like Ben Drowned had the chance of achieving real success.\nSanders also argues that Ben Drowned didn't just creep people out, it quite likely influenced later examples of urban legends about video games including Herobrine, a creepy, white-eyed character that supposedly appeared in Minecraft (but never actually did) and \"PBBV\", an evil spirit said to inhabit the virtual reality world of the game Gorilla Tag.\nThe creator of YouTube horror series Petscop, about a fictitious PlayStation One game that turns increasingly dark as the protagonist plays it, says he drew inspiration from Ben Drowned, among other sources.\nBen Drowned, which was first and foremost a text-based narrative complemented by video content, might seem anachronistic today. Zawacki says it's now more common to find stories like this presented in video-only formats.\nGaming writer and podcaster Marn Silverman, argues that while the delivery of Ben Drowned was \"of its time\", the story appears to have influenced a raft of video games built around the concept that they are possessed in one way or another \u2013 such as No Players Online, a supposedly haunted first-person shooter.\nIt's not surprising that a lot of these stories and games play on the nostalgia theme, says Emily Crawford, a digital media specialist in Washington DC who wrote about Ben Drowned while studying film and electronic media in graduate school. Games of the Nintendo 64 era, with their jagged, somewhat primitive 3D graphics, are especially good fodder for 21st Century ghost stories.\n\"The clunkier early technology left a lot more room for things to go wrong,\" Crawford says.\nTechnologies that are fallible have long given rise to anxiety and alarm. Ben Drowned is \"an articulation of the fears of the internet age\", says Sanders. \"Viruses, corruption, the blurring of the boundary between me at the computer and the computer itself.\"\nBen's desperation to haunt someone, and to spread to other people's computers via the internet, is a kind of demonic \"virality\", adds Sanders. It fits existing worries about the web and what we might find there, giving the concept an unsettling plausibility.\nFor many, experiences with Ben Drowned as a child were formative. Charlie Duke, a college student in the US, was around eight when he first heard about the story. He found a video about Ben Drowned and that, a mere summary of the original creepypasta, was enough to chill him to the bone.\n\"I immediately closed the video,\" he recalls. \"It got so stuck in my mind, it gave me anxiety for a long time.\" He even deleted a version of Majora's Mask he had on his computer, just to be safe. Duke says the ghost story played a significant role in debilitating anxiety attacks he suffered in the following years. He'd freeze up, hyperventilate and go completely pale. \"It was always looking for a trigger and Ben Drowned happened to be one of those triggers, or even the main one at the time.\"\nSaarthak Johri was also long-troubled by the story. The unnerving statue in the story that seemingly represented Ben's ghost, and the idea that he or his family members could be petrified in a similar way \"freaked me out so much\", he says.\nHall is aware that, for some people, Ben Drowned felt a little too real. \"That stuff sucks,\" he says, adding that accounts like Duke's have made him feel a little guilty at times. \"I want to tell people a story, I don't actually want to cause trauma.\"\nDespite the unpleasant experiences that Johri and Duke say they had after reading Ben Drowned, both have positive things to say about it today. \"It was kind of the first thing that connected me to other people in my middle school,\" says Johri. \"You have litmus tests for how online or digital people might be and knowing about these creepypastas is one of them.\"\nDuke says that Majora's Mask is one of his favourite games of all time. He has revisited Ben Drowned in the years since his first brush with the story and he notes that therapy has helped him to better understand and control his anxiety. \"It allowed me to look at myself in ways I don't think a lot of people my age [did],\" Duke says. \"I don't know if would thank Ben Drowned for that, but it definitely played a part.\"\nFor Hall, writing an internet ghost story has led to other ventures including a new YouTube series he plans to release later this year called Dead Save, featuring alternate versions of classic video games. As with Ben Drowned, he'll use modding tools to edit those original games and bring to life urban myths about them that have circled online. He also says he would love to release a playable version of the haunted Majora's Mask cartridge one day.\nBut, reflecting on Ben Drowned 15 years after its original publication, there's something else to consider. While ghost stories about technology and video games remain popular, Sanders points out that we are all, these days, very used to the idea that there could be some malevolent actor trying to control our computer or harm us through our devices. Whether that's an email scam, social media bots, ransomware or people targeting us with disinformation or abusive content.\nThe threat lurking within technology isn't demonic, it's us. The \"fantastic\" supernaturalism of Ben Drowned seems almost quaint in comparison.\n\"Now we're just like, 'Oh yeah, it's out there, there are Bens out there waiting to happen, waiting to control our computers',\" says Sanders. \"We just don't think they're fantastic anymore.\"\n--\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\u00a0\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0X\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.",

The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically. \nBut in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover. \n\"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people. \n\"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\"",

        "article_text": "The return of Marvel, Final Destination and Mission: Impossible franchises are among this month's unmissable films to watch and stream.\nCobra Kai began life as a YouTube series which picked up from where the 40-year-old Karate Kid franchise left off. In short, it didn't sound like essential viewing. But the series went on to be an Emmy-nominated, critically acclaimed, six-season hit, and it put the star of the 1984 film, Ralph Macchio, back in the limelight. Now Macchio is starring in a Karate Kid sequel, Karate Kid Legends, featuring Ben Wang as the new Kid on the block, a Chinese teenager who learns to fight bullies in New York. Confusingly, Legends follows the continuity of the original Karate Kid films, as well as the Cobra Kai series, but it also brings in Jackie Chan's Mr Han, who was in the 2010 Karate Kid remake. Still, Macchio promises that all the elements in this shared universe will be in balance \u2013 and as Mr Miyagi once explained, \"Balance is key\". \"Once we were able to line that up, for the Cobra Kai story to lead into the new film \u2013 even though they're separate ecosystems \u2013 it all made sense for me,\" Macchio said in Variety. \"Then, working with Jackie was just super exciting. I started this on the big screen. How cool is it to get it back to the big screen?\"\nReleased on 28, 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally\nDanny and Michael Philippou are the Australian twins who made Talk to Me, a terrifically creepy indie horror film which was an international hit in 2023. It was such a success, in fact, that you might have expected the Philippous to move straight onto a sequel, or even to a Hollywood blockbuster. Instead, the brothers stayed in their hometown of Adelaide and made another low-budget horror film with an original story: Bring Her Back stars Sally Hawkins as a foster mother, Laura, who is trying to contact the dead. Thematically, this supernatural chiller is closely related to Talk to Me, although it's been given extra depth by a death in the Philippou family.\u00a0\"We were doing pre-production meetings, then we started shooting, and there was no time to properly sort through those emotions,\" Danny Philippou said in Den of Geek. \"They sort of poured themselves out in the script and in conversations with Sally, so that bled into the character of Laura and scenes that were meant to be scary suddenly turned sad. I think there's a rawness in it that wasn't in Talk to Me.\"\nReleased on 29 and 30 May in cinemas internationally\nThe co-director of Deaf President Now!, Nyle DiMarco, says that his documentary tells \"the story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of\". Its setting is Gallaudet University in Washington DC, the world's first university for deaf and hard of hearing students. Gallaudet was established in 1864, but for more than a century, none of its presidents was deaf. In 1988, when the board of trustees appointed yet another hearing president over two deaf candidates, the students wouldn't stand for it. Eight days of protests followed \u2013 and four of the protesters are interviewed in the film. Co-directed by Davis Guggenheim, who made the Oscar-winning An Inconvenient Truth and Still: A Michael J Fox Movie, Deaf President Now! is \"a firebrand historical documentary that is as crowd-pleasing and informative as it is innovative and inclusive\", says Marya E Gates at RobertEbert.com.\nReleased on 16 May on Apple+ internationally\nThere were five Final Destination films from 2000 to 2011, all with the same structure. First, there would be a spectacular catastrophe; then this sequence would be revealed to be someone's premonition; then the person who had the premonition would save a handful of people from the catastrophe when it actually happened; but then those people would be claimed by Death, one by one, usually via complicated accidents. Now the gleefully grisly franchise is back from the dead, so prepare to squeal and squirm at yet more ingeniously nasty killings. But Final Destination: Bloodlines has moved on from the previous films in one respect. According to the trailer, it turns out that all of the victims in the previous five films were descended from people who were saved from one particular catastrophe, decades ago. That means that the film isn't just about a group of strangers, but a family that is trying to break an inherited curse. \"Suddenly, the five films are not just one fun, gory rollercoaster ride after another, but a series with a lot of interweaving emotional weight,\" says Shawn Van Horn in Collider. \"Those stronger relationships are going to make the characters more three-dimensional, and we'll likely be rooting for their survival rather than relishing in the bloodshed.\" Well\u2026 maybe.\nReleased on 14, 15 and 16 May in cinemas internationally\nIn 2018, Paul Feig's A Simple Favour finished with Blake Lively's glamorous killer being jailed for 20 years, and with Anna Kendrick's widowed mother finding fame as a crime-solving vlogger, so a sequel didn't seem likely. But the film prided itself on its outrageous plot twists, so maybe it's appropriate that, seven years on, Lively's character is not just free from prison, but is about to marry a wealthy Italian on the island of Capri \u2013 and she is determined that her old frenemy should be her maid of honour. A Simple Favour was a devilish comedy noir that treated viewers to deceit, betrayal, murder, and the sight of Lively sipping martinis while wearing absurdly stylish outfits. Another Simple Favour is even more lavish in its fashions, and even more head-spinning in its plotting. Kristy Puchko in Mashable calls it a \"shapeshifting creature, transforming in tone moment to moment to revel in biting humour, relish in mob drama [and] plunge into the delicious depths of mad women in the psycho-biddy subgenre\". Fans of the first film will \"cherish this divinely twisted thriller\".\u00a0\nReleased on 1 May on Prime Video internationally\nTim Robinson, a Saturday Night Live alumnus with his own sketch show, Netflix's I Think You Should Leave, has his first big-screen leading role in Friendship. And, true to form, it will make you cringe as much as laugh. Robinson plays Craig, a suburban office worker who is too awkward to have any real friends. Then he meets his neighbour, Brian (Paul Rudd), a weatherman who plays in a punk band in his spare time, which makes him fabulously cool by Craig's standards. Craig is thrilled to hang out with his Brian and his buddies, but after he ruins one social occasion too many, Brian \"breaks up\" with him, and he spirals out of control. Written and directed by Andrew DeYoung, this bromantic black comedy is \"feverishly and hilariously demented\", says Nick Schager in the Daily Beast. \"Partnered with the always ridiculous Rudd, Robinson reconfirms his standing as the reigning master of discomfort. Together, they make Friendship the funniest movie of the year.\"\nReleased on 9 May in the US\nAdmittedly, the last of Disney's live-action remakes, Snow White, was (a) dogged by controversy, and (b) not very good, but Lilo & Stitch looks a lot more promising. The film retells the story a genetically engineered, blue-furred alien called Experiment 626, or Stitch. He is so destructive that he is condemned to be exiled to an asteroid, but he escapes from the interstellar authorities and crash-lands on Earth, where he is befriended by a Hawaiian girl, Lilo. The original 2002 film, then, was one of the few Disney cartoons to have a modern-day US setting, and one of the few to mix contemporary human beings with fantastical creatures \u2013 so, for once, a remake that has both live-action and CGI characters makes total sense. Another good sign is that the film is directed by Dean Fleischer Camp, who made the Oscar-nominated charmer Marcel the Shell with Shoes On. And a third key factor is that, in the trailers, Maia Kealoha, who plays Lilo, seems to have the most adorable chemistry with an alien since Drew Barrymore was in ET The Extra Terrestrial.\nReleased on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally\nNicolas Cage doesn't appear in many subtle dramas these days, so you may not be surprised to hear that The Surfer is \"a gloriously demented B-movie thriller\", as Xan Brooks puts it in The Observer, or that Cage cranks \"the acting dial from befuddled to vexed to outraged to volcanic\". He plays an unnamed businessman who has returned to Australia after years in California, and who wants to buy the beachfront house where he grew up. But when he tries to surf in a nearby bay, he is harassed by a gang of locals led by a shamanic thug (Julian McMahon). Cage's character won't be put off, though, and camps out in the car park above the beach, sacrificing his possessions and his sanity in the process. \"Crisply scripted by Thomas Martin and directed by Lorcan Finnegan with a pleasing, no-frills intensity,\" says Brooks, \"The Surfer [is] a low-budget, hard-hitting comic bruiser of a picture: a midlife-crisis movie dressed up as a 1970s exploitation flick [with a] wild, roiling, hallucinogenic vibe.\"\nReleased on 2 May in the US and Canada, 9 May in the UK and Ireland, and 15 May in Australia\nJane Austen may be turning 250 in December, but film and TV directors are as smitten by her novels as ever. Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden are starring in a new Netflix adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, and before that there is a French romantic comedy drama, Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, written and directed by Laura Piani. Camille Rutherford stars as Agathe, who works in a bookshop in Paris, but dreams of becoming an author. With the encouragement of her friend Felix (Pablo Pauly), she accepts the offer of a writing residency in England set up by the Austen estate. Will she finish her novel at last? Will she come to see Felix as more than a friend? Or will she fall for one of the residency's organisers (Charlie Anson), a handsome toff who happens to be the great-great-great-great-nephew of Austen\u00a0herself? \"The film is a delightful ode to Jane Austen's novels, serving up a unique blend of humour and introspection that reflects both European sensibilities and the particular quirks of Austen's world,\" says Louisa Moore in Screen Zealots.\nReleased on 16 May in Spain, 23 May in the US, and 30 May in the UK\nThe original Mission: Impossible TV series ran for just seven years, but the film series has been running for 29 \u2013 and its star, Tom Cruise, does plenty of running himself. Could the franchise be coming to a conclusion at last? The subtitle of the eighth instalment, Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning, suggests that Ethan Hunt won't be choosing to accept any more missions after this one, so this could be the last time we'll see Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell crashing cars and jumping off buildings. On the other hand, Cruise is refusing to confirm whether or not Hunt will live to fight another day. \"You gotta see the movie,\" he told Empire magazine. \"It's a hard thing for me to discuss at the moment, because it really is something that you have to experience.\" The film's director, Christopher McQuarrie, is also being cagey, but he does acknowledge that the word \"Final\" is in there for a reason. \"It is, I hope, the satisfying conclusion to a 30-year story arc,\" he says. \"I'm pretty confident that people are going to feel that the title was appropriate.\"\nReleased on 21, 22 and 23 May in cinemas internationally\nIt seems as if writers and directors can't stop celebrating/ satirising the luxurious lifestyles \u2013 and enviable kitchens \u2013 of the super-rich, whether in such television series as The White Lotus, The Perfect Couple and Your Friends and Neighbors, or in such films as Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness and Blink Twice. The sharpest of all of these depictions is Succession, Jesse Armstrong's multiple Emmy-winning series about a Murdoch-alike media dynasty. And now, two years after Succession concluded its run, Armstrong returns to the territory he has made his own. Mountainhead is a comedy drama shot in Park City, Utah, starring Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith and Ramy Youssef as billionaire tech bros on holiday in a ski resort during a global crisis. The film wasn't even shot until March this year, so Armstrong and his team must be editing it at lightning speed. Could that mean that Mountainhead will be the most topical fictional commentary on the 1% so far?\nReleased on 31 May on HBO and Max, and 1 June on Sky and NOW\n\"After years of misfires, disappointments, and a growing sense of superhero fatigue, the MCU looks poised for a comeback with the highly anticipated arrival of Thunderbolts,\" says Linda Marric in HeyUGuys, \"a gritty but mostly fun new adventure that just might put Marvel back on top.\" The idea behind this rough-edged spy caper is that Marvel's least powerful, least glamorous, and least fulfilled superheroes have been carrying out covert missions for a shady businesswoman (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). When she decides that they're expendable, these grumpy loners are forced to form a ragtag team consisting of Florence Pugh's Yelena, David Harbour's Red Guardian, Sebastian Stan's Winter Soldier, Wyatt Russell's US Agent, and Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost. \"It is a film that makes us truly care about its characters and their well-being,\" says Marric. \"It's gritty, chaotic and sometimes uneven, but also thrilling and unexpectedly heartfelt. Best of all, it proves Marvel can still surprise us when it stops trying to please everyone and leans into the weirdness.\"\u00a0\nOut now in cinemas internationally\n--\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.\u00a0",

        "article_text": "A charity has called for the government to commit to a date when plastic will be banned in wet wipes, to help prevent the effect they are having on the River Thames. \nThames21 says wet wipes are not only creating artificial islands, harming wildlife and impacting water quality; they are reshaping the waterway itself. \nThe charity said although plans were announced last year to ban the sale of plastic wet wipes, progress had halted following the general election. \nA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \"Plastic wet wipes clog up our sewers, pollute our waterways and harm our treasured wildlife. That is why the government will ban them.\"\nLiz Gyekye from Thames21 said: \"Wet wipes are a massive problem, it's devastating.\n\"The principal challenge is that people flush the wet wipes down the toilets, then you get sewage overflows after heavy rain that chuck them into the river.\n\"They then destroy wildlife because it ingests these microplastics when they break down.\"\nMs Gyekye said the charity wanted the government to act \"urgently\". \n\"We had the previous Conservative government last year commit to banning plastic in wet wipes, and now we're calling on this government to implement this ban,\" she said. \nAsked why the public were still flushing wet wipes despite the obvious damage being caused, Ms Gyekye said: \"I think the issue is over labels - some labels say they are 'flushable' - but there is no marine biodegradable standard out there - so they should all just go in the bin.\"\nShe added: \"Consumers need to do their part and dispose of their waste correctly, flushing down only the 3 Ps (pee, poo, and paper).\"\nThe director of sustainability at the Port of London Authority (PLA), Grace Rawnsley, said the new Thames super sewer \"should help\" cope with flushed wet wipes, but said the ban on plastic in wet wipes was \"key\" to achieving a cleaner river. \nVolunteer Janice Bruce-Brande said that although the wet wipe island she was surveying was \"soul destroying\", she had noticed a possible improvement since the introduction of the super sewer. \nBut she said it was still \"so disheartening\" to see the wet wipe problem. \nIn response to Thames21's calls, a Defra spokesperson told the BBC: \"Plastic wet wipes clog up our sewers, pollute our waterways and harm our treasured wildlife.\n\"That is why the government will ban them.\n\"This is part of our wider plan to clean up our rivers.

So in the context of that, and his own weekend, second was not too bad.\n\"I'm very happy with the end result,\" Norris said. \"Just a shame when you miss out on pole, so that's the only frustrating bit.\n\"But I've been trying different things, I've been doing different things with the team to try and work a bit more in this area and things have been taking a step forward.

So it takes a bit more time.\n\"But for sure it was not negative. And yeah, from here we can work and try to improve it further because from my feeling, of course, we're not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight.\"\nNorris beat team-mate Oscar Piastri to victory in the sprint race, narrowing the gap between them in the drivers' championship by one point\nIn McLaren's view, Red Bull have not been painting the most accurate picture of the competitive picture between the two teams.\n\"Red Bull, they are very good at making fast cars,\" Stella said. \"They are very exceptionally good, I would say, at driving fast cars, and they are extremely good also in creating the narrative to their advantage.\n\"They exploit every possible opportunity to stay in the competition, and some of these opportunities sometimes is to create the narrative, like, 'oh, we are making miracles here, the others should win every single practice session and qualifying and race.'\n\"This is the narrative created by some of our competitors, which we read occasionally and then we change the page and we focus on ourselves.\"\nThe grid sets up an intriguing race. The title contenders are in reverse order, with an interloper between Norris and Piastri in the form of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.\nAnd Norris scents an opportunity to nail his first victory since the opening race of the season in Australia back in March.\nIn qualifying, he made errors at the last corner on both his laps, each time costing about 0.2secs, so he knows the pace is in the car.\n\"Max has always been good in qualifying and as a team we have struggled a little more in qualifying, whether that's set-up or what, I'm not too sure,\" Norris said.\n\"We know the Red Bulls are running high downforce, which allows them especially with the DRS (in qualifying) to be a lot more competitive. But it's a long race and we know we have good pace in both conditions.\n\"I don't just expect competition from Max. Kimi's been quick all weekend and Oscar has been as well.

        "article_text": "A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild.\nAnimals born and raised in zoos are rarely considered for release because they either don't have the survival skills or have become too used to human interaction.\nBut a shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo.\nIt has been moved to Germany's Black Forest where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge.\nThis week the BBC watched on as, with the help of some judicious prodding with a broom, the Newquay lynx was loaded onto a truck headed for southwestern Germany.\nTwo days later we were in Germany as it was cajoled into a 1,200-sq-metre enclosure. John Meek from Newquay Zoo was also on hand to see the lynx gingerly stroll out into its new home.\n\"I'm a big boy but I had a few tears in my eyes,\" he said. \" Nowadays, zoos are not here to keep animals in cages. They're there for conservation. And this is it, conservation in action.\"\nThousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.  \nThough not officially classed as a \"big cat\" Eurasian lynx can weigh up to 30 kilos and hunt deer for food. \nOnce native to the UK they were driven to extinction hundreds of years ago and with British deer populations at record levels there have been calls for their re-introduction. \n\"Basically I'm Tinder for the zoo-born lynx,\" says Dina Gebhardt from Bern Animal Park with a smile when I speak to her on Zoom.\nIt was her who sent out the SOS for the Newquay lynx. \nThe lynx-breeding coordinator for the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), she matches females and males from across the continent as well as finding new homes for their offspring. \n\"Our nature is very fragmented, due to railways and streets and cities. And this means we created a lot of barriers for the lynx, which leads to inbreeding,\" Dina says.\nTo combat that Dina finds captive young lynx that can be introduced into the wild to increase numbers and improve the genetic mix. Usually Dina's lynxes have been raised from birth with the minimum of human contact, specifically with release in mind. \nBut last year, much to Dina's frustration, there was a particularly high number of male lynxes born. And a successful rewilding programme needs females much more  than males.\nSo Dina reached out to Newquay Zoo to ask them if their one year old female might be available.\n\"Of course we said yes straight away, that's something that we'd love to do,\" says John Meek, the curator of plants and animals at Newquay Zoo. \nOver the next few months the lynx will be monitored to see if it has the necessary skills to survive in the wild. Catching and killing prey is not expected to be a problem.\n\"If you know your cats, you know that even a cat that has lived in a room its whole life, once it gets out is able to kill a bird or a mouse,\" Eva Klebelsberg who runs the lynx reintroduction programme for Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg told us.\nWe're standing over the carcass of a Roe Deer in the Black Forest just outside Karlsruhe. There is a small population of lynxes already living in the forest and this is one of their kills.\nThere are puncture marks on its throat \u2013 a sure sign.\n\"Our ecosystems in Europe are missing large predators,\" Eva says, explaining that the lynx helps control populations of deer as well as ensuring that they keep moving and don't strip forested areas.\nThe key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans. Having spent its entire life looking through bars at visitors and being fed by keepers it will need to show that it is not going to seek out more human interaction.\n\"Central Europe is very crowded and we don't have many places where there is enough space for larger animals.\" says Dr Marco Roller from Karlsruhe zoo, who manages the enclosure. \n\"We don't want human animal conflicts. So for us it's important we don't have aggressive animals or curious animals which may walk through cities or close to human settlements.\"\nThe final decision on the Newquay lynx's fate will be taken later in the summer after several months of close monitoring. \n",

We've gotta pick it up and I've spoken to a lot of peers who all had the same feeling.\"\nLorde's lead single, What Was That, was officially released last week after being teased on TikTok, debuting in the UK Top 10.\nLorde says it gives a flavour of her upcoming album, where she's tried to reconnect with her younger self.\n\"I really went into it like, 'just make something for you, just make something you think is cool',\" she says.\n\"It's not unlike how I was making music as a 15-year-old, just trying to impress myself.\n\"What Was That was the first song from this album that I wrote and was like, 'OK, I know where to go with this',\" she says, describing the track as \"Lorde canon\" and \"recognisably me\". \n\"It's funny to be 12 years into your career and for people to have an understanding of your tropes and what you do.\" \nThe singer says she \"wanted to lock people back in\" to her sound after her last album, 2021's Solar Power, which she says was \"a very different flavour for me\".\n\"It's about going to the core of who I am in the purest way possible, stripping away anything unnecessary.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
